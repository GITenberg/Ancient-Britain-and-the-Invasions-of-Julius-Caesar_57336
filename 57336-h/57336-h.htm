<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>This book is in one sense a companion of my <cite>Caesar’s
Conquest of Gaul</cite>; and much that was written in the preface
of that volume is equally applicable here. The last three
chapters of Part I, and the later articles in Part II, are
intended to do for Britain what I formerly tried to do for
Gaul; but whereas the main object was then to illustrate
the conquest, and the opening chapter was merely introductory,
my aim in these pages has been to tell the story of
man’s life in our island from the earliest times in detail.
What has been called ‘prehistory’ cannot be written without
knowledge of archaeology; but from the historical standpoint
archaeological details must be handled, not for their
own sake, but only in so far as they illustrate the development
of culture. The two books are constructed on the
same principle: in this, as in the other, the second
part is devoted to questions which could not properly be
discussed in narrative or quasi-narrative chapters, though
I am encouraged by the judgement of expert critics, British,
American, and Continental, of <cite>Caesar’s Conquest of Gaul</cite>, to
hope that general readers who are interested in these matters
may not find the articles which deal with them tedious. Those
on Stonehenge, Ictis, and the ethnology of Britain, although
they controvert certain opinions which are commonly
accepted, will, I hope, tend to place facts in their true light.
Two articles deal with well-worn themes,&mdash;the identity of the
Portus Itius, and the place of Caesar’s landing in Britain.
These problems have been pronounced by eminent scholars,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
including Mommsen, to be insoluble; nevertheless, I venture
to affirm that in both cases the inquiry has now been worked
out to demonstration. Critics who may be disposed to
regard this claim as arrogant or frivolous will, I trust, read
the articles through before passing judgement upon them.
The questions would have been settled long ago if any competent
writer had bestowed upon them as much care as has
been expended in investigating Hannibal’s passage over the
Alps.</p>

<p>Books and articles on various branches of the study of
ancient Britain are practically innumerable; no other
book, intended to treat it comprehensively from the beginning
to the Roman invasion of <small>A.D.</small> 43, has, so far as I know,
yet appeared.</p>

<p>I wish to express my gratitude to all who have in any way
helped me. I am indebted to Sir John Evans for figures
1-6, 8-11, 14, 15, and 18-29, as well as for an opinion, most
kindly given, in regard to certain coins which are not mentioned
in his <cite>Coins of the Ancient Britons</cite>; to the Director
of the British Museum for figures 30, 36-9, 41, 43, and 44;
to the Society of Antiquaries for figures 7, 13, 16, 31, 35,
and 40; to the Delegates of the Oxford University Press for
figures 12 and 32-4; to Dr. Joseph Anderson for figure 17;
and to Canon Greenwell for a proof of a valuable and interesting
article&mdash;‘Early Iron Age Burials in Yorkshire’&mdash;which,
I believe, is to appear in <cite>Archaeologia</cite>. Captain Tizard, R.N.,
F.R.S., kindly answered various questions which I asked
him about tidal currents. Mr. E. J. Webb, Sir George
Darwin, Professor Postgate, Professor Haverfield, Mr. Clement
Reid, F.R.S., Mr. George Barrow, F.G.S., Captain J. Iron,
Commander Richmond, R.N., and Commander Boxer, R.N.,
gave me information, which, in every instance, will be found,
acknowledged either in footnotes of Part I, or in Part II,
on various points of detail.

<p>It is vain to plead that work would have been better if
circumstances had been more favourable. But if any indulgence
may be accorded to an author who, except on holidays,
can only find leisure for writing or research after he has
fulfilled the duties of an exacting profession, and who, in
order to gain time, has worked steadily throughout his
vacations for nearly thirty years, I am entitled to it.</p>

<p id="note_xvi">[The maps of South-Eastern Britain and East Kent, like all maps of
Ancient Britain, are inevitably inexact; but the errors are unimportant.
The Dover cliffs, for instance, have lost by erosion, but one cannot say
how much (see pages 528-30); nor is it possible to indicate the exact
nature of the slight change which the coast has undergone between
Sandown Castle and Walmer Castle (pages 521-5). Again, I have not
attempted to delineate the coast west of Pevensey or west or north of
Reculver precisely as it was in 55 <small>B.C.</small>, because, even if such an attempt
had been successful, nothing would have been gained for the purpose of
this book. As far as possible, however, the maps represent the conclusions
reached in the article on the configuration of the coast of Kent in the
time of Caesar. The outline of Richborough harbour and of the estuary
between Thanet and the mainland is intended to show approximately
the high-water mark of spring tides. At low tide the channel was very
narrow (page 519).]

<h3 id="PI_CI_Pg1">INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>When Caesar was about to sail on his first expedition
to Britain, he summoned the Gallic traders whose vessels
used to ply between Gaul and the Kentish coast, and tried
to elicit from them information; but, to quote his own
words, ‘he could not find out either the extent of the island,
or what tribes dwelt therein, or their size, or their method
of fighting, or their manners and customs, or what harbours
were capable of accommodating a large flotilla.’ Even
after he had seen the country and its inhabitants with his
observant eyes he was not much better informed: all that
he could learn about the aborigines he summed up in a
single sentence; and later writers, Greek, Italian, and
mediaeval&mdash;Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, Augustus Caesar,
Pomponius Mela, Tacitus, Suetonius, Dion Cassius, Herodian,
and the rest&mdash;added very little to the knowledge which he
had gathered. Yet the materials which are now available
for a description of prehistoric and pre-Roman Britain,
however limited their range, are so abundant that the
difficulty is to use them with discrimination and to fashion
the essential into a work of art. How have these materials
been obtained? When the general reader takes up a history,
he accepts the narrative in a spirit more or less sceptical.
He knows that it has been composed, either directly or at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
second hand, from written, perhaps also from oral testimony;
and he rarely troubles himself to inquire what the evidence
is, or with what diligence and acuteness it has been sifted.
But when he is invited to read an account of the evolution
of culture among people who recorded nothing and of whom
nothing was recorded, it is natural that he should insist
upon peering into the writer’s workshop that he may judge
for himself what the materials are worth.</p>

<p>During many centuries, while the materials were most
abundant, they remained unused. Many of them were
rifled by treasure-seekers, carted away by builders, or destroyed
by the plough. Even when the Renaissance
turned men’s minds to the study of the past, they had no
thought of any sources of information except the written
documents which they were only beginning to learn how
to use. The Italian scholar, Raymond de Marliano, the
Dutch geographer, Abraham Ortels, made futile guesses
about topographical questions suggested by Caesar’s <cite>Commentaries</cite>,
but never dreamed that there was anything
to be learned of a people who had lived in Britain when
the South Foreland and Cape Grisnez were still undivided.
Camden travelled over the length and breadth of England,
amassing stores of information, much of which he did not
know how to interpret, and built up geographical theories
upon place-names, which, in default of linguistic science,
were of necessity worthless. Even the great French scholars
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries&mdash;Chifflet, Du
Fresne, Scaliger, Sanson, and d’Anville&mdash;although their
geographical essays are still worth reading, failed to determine
the port from which Caesar had sailed to Britain.
Stukeley, who was one of the first to excavate barrows
and describe their contents and who made valuable observations
of some of our megalithic monuments, encumbered
his folios with fanciful speculations which only served to
entertain his contemporaries and to mislead posterity.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
these men had no access to the sources which are now open
to many who are intellectually their inferiors; and, notwithstanding
the smallness of their achievement, they did
their work as pioneers.</p>

<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century a spirit of
antiquarian curiosity was aroused in England. The Society
of Antiquaries, which had been founded in 1717, received
in 1752 a charter from George the Second; and in 1770
appeared the first number of their principal organ, <cite>Archaeologia</cite>,
which is still in course of publication. Many of the
earlier papers were crude and superficial, showing keen
interest in the things of the past, but naturally betraying
ignorance of the methods by which alone the significance of
antiquarian discoveries could be ascertained. Early in
the nineteenth century, however, Sir Richard Colt Hoare
and his friend, William Cunnington, began to excavate
the barrows of Wiltshire; and with their labours the era
of scientific investigation may be said to have begun.
Hoare had in earlier life been an ardent fox-hunter; but,
as he grew older, he found that barrow-digging was a pastime
more exciting still. Craniology was at that time
unborn; and Hoare omitted to measure the numerous
skeletons which he discovered or to utilize them for the
advancement of ethnology. Even the work that he professed
to do was often marred by a lack of thoroughness
which, although it was inevitable in a pioneer, irritated the
critical spirit of later explorers.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> But with all its limitations
the <cite>Ancient History of North and South Wiltshire</cite>, the
first volume of which appeared in 1812, was an important
work. A few years earlier, John Frere had recorded in
<cite>Archaeologia</cite><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> the discoveries of stone implements which
he had made at Hoxne in Suffolk. Such discoveries had
of course in innumerable instances passed unrecorded.
In the British Isles, as in many other lands, flint arrow-heads
were regarded by the peasants who found them as
fairy-darts; while stone axes, which in Scotland, Ireland,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
and Cornwall, are still deemed to possess medical virtues,
were said to have fallen from the sky.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> In the time of
Charles the Second, however, Sir Robert Sibbald, greatly
daring, affirmed that the fairy-darts had been made by
man;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and nearly a century before the time of Frere an
implement, which has since been assigned to the Palaeolithic
Age, had been found near Gray’s Inn Lane, and
had been vaguely described as ‘a British weapon’. But
Frere saw that the tools which he had collected were not to
be ascribed even to the ‘painted savages’ who had resisted
the invasion of Caesar; and although even he did not
suspect their immeasurable antiquity, he declared that they
must have belonged to ‘a very remote period indeed’ and
to ‘a people who had not the use of metals’. In 1824
Dr. Buckland, who had spent some years in exploring
ossiferous caves, published an account of his work in
<cite>Reliquiae Diluvianae</cite>, a book which, by attributing the
phenomena that it recorded to an universal deluge, impelled
geological research in a wrong direction, and delayed for
many years the recognition of the truth that the earlier
human occupants of the caves had been contemporary
with the mammoth and other extinct animals. Soon afterwards
MacEnery, whose example was followed by Godwin
Austen, examined Kent’s Cavern near Torquay, a task
which was systematically completed some five-and-twenty
years ago by a committee of the British Association. It
was not, however, before the middle of the nineteenth century
that the knowledge of the Stone Ages began to be built
up on a sound foundation. From 1841 to 1860 Boucher
de Perthes was patiently exploring in the neighbourhood
of Abbeville and Amiens the gravels which the river Somme
had deposited in the Pleistocene Period, and collecting flints
which were proved to have been shaped by the hands of
man. Lyell, Prestwich, John Evans, Lubbock, and Flower
visited the scene of his labours, and testified to the authenticity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
of his discoveries; and after long controversy the most
reluctant were forced to admit that the human race had
existed at a period infinitely more remote than had hitherto
been imagined. Similar discoveries were soon made in
England, in various European countries, in Africa, Asia,
and America. In our islands, as well as on the Continent,
as antiquarian zeal became more widely diffused,
the need of organized effort was felt; and, side by side
with the leading academies&mdash;the Society of Antiquaries,
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, the Royal Archaeological
Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, the Royal
Irish Academy, the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland,
and the Cambrian Archaeological Association&mdash;local societies
were gradually formed in every important provincial town.
Accident from time to time revealed objects for which no
search had been made. Ploughmen guiding their teams,
navvies working upon roads or in railway-cuttings, miners
and quarrymen, labourers draining land, sportsmen groping
after game which they had shot, came upon antiquities
of the nature of which they were ignorant. Evans, in
the intervals of leisure which he could win from a busy
life, indefatigably collected implements of stone, bone,
and bronze, systematized the discoveries of a host of minor
workers, and marshalled facts and deductions in volumes
which have become classical; and, not content with this,
he supplemented the labours of Akerman, Hawkins, Roach
Smith, and others, and revealed to his countrymen the
origin, the varieties, and the geographical distribution of
the coins which their British ancestors had minted, and the
historical value of which he was the first to emphasize.
His son, who has lately become famous as the explorer of
Crete, carried his researches further afield, but often found
time to grapple with British problems; contributed to our
knowledge of Stonehenge and other megalithic circles;
and by his discoveries at Aylesford in Kent threw a beam
of light upon the history of the Celtic Iron Age. Boyd
Dawkins explored the caves of Somersetshire, Derbyshire,
and Wales. Bateman, Thurnam, Davis, Warne, Greenwell,
Mortimer, and Atkinson of Danby continued in a more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
scientific spirit the labours of Hoare,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and recorded the
discoveries which they had made in numerous barrows.
General Pitt-Rivers brought the experience of a soldier,
the sagacity of a man of the world, and the genius which
was his own to the investigation of archaeological and
anthropological problems; demonstrated the value of
thorough excavation<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> and of accurate pictorial illustration;
impressed upon the rising school of students the need of
precision in recording the circumstances of every find;
and by expending a considerable fortune in adding to
knowledge set an example of enlightened generosity. Sir
Arthur Mitchell, in a series of lectures<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> which have been
described as a masterpiece of sceptical irony, warned
antiquaries, but in no didactic spirit, to think, and to
think again, before they drew conclusions from the records
which the spade had revealed. The Devonshire Association
appointed committees to examine the antiquities of their
richly dowered county, and printed a series of reports upon
the megalithic monuments, the graves, and the ‘hut-circles’
of Dartmoor. John Abercromby traced from Great Britain
to the original seat of manufacture the sites where the so-called
drinking-cups, which accompanied so many British
interments of the earlier round barrows, have been found;
while Romilly Allen, following in the steps of Wollaston
Franks, helped to elucidate the development of the art of
the Bronze Age and the Late Celtic Period. Professor
Gowland disclosed by excavation the origins of Stonehenge,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
and by his metallurgical knowledge enabled us to understand
the methods of prehistoric miners. Charles Read made
intelligible, even to casual visitors, the collection of antiquities
in the British Museum which illustrates the culture
of the Ages of Stone, Bronze, and Iron. Francis Haverfield,
scholar, archaeologist, and practical excavator, while
making himself the foremost authority on the history of
Roman Britain, incidentally enlarged the records of pre-Roman
times. Joseph Anderson carried on the work
which Daniel Wilson had begun, and described the successive
stages of culture through which the inhabitants of
Scotland had passed from the earliest to the beginning of
the historic period. Coles, Christison, and Bryce added
significant details to the information which his lectures
had given. But it would be tedious to prolong the list of
workers. Everywhere the success with which the last
resting-places of the dead had been made to tell their tale
stimulated antiquaries to search for fresh relics that might
help them to realize more fully how those dead had lived.
Flint quarries and workshops, where primitive tools were
fabricated, hut-circles, Scottish brochs, lake-dwellings, pits,
and ‘earth-houses’ were explored; and, in response to
the exhortations of Pitt-Rivers, camps and other earthworks
were patiently excavated, although, for lack of funds,
research of this kind has not progressed very far. The
exploration of the far-famed marsh-village at Glastonbury
is nearly complete; and the results which have been obtained,
collated with those that were yielded by the examination
of the camps of Cissbury, Lewes, Hod Hill, and Hunsbury,
have done much to dispel the old fancy that the ancient
Briton was a savage.</p>

<p>But perhaps no intelligent man ever progressed far in
archaeological study without discovering for himself this
caution:&mdash;though the relics of man’s handiwork, unlike
his written history, cannot lie, their meaning may in divers
ways be misinterpreted. They will not yield it up except
to the trained and discerning eye.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile toilers in other fields were co-operating with
the archaeologists. Physical anthropology began to make
strides. Since Davis, Thurnam, and Rolleston described the
skeletons which had reposed in the long barrows and the
round barrows of Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Yorkshire, and
Northumberland, since Huxley wrote his memoirs on the
river-bed skulls of England and Ireland, greater accuracy
of method has been evolved, and Beddoe, Turner, Garson,
and Haddon have supplemented and corrected their predecessors’
work. Geologists endeavoured to determine the
configuration of the land at the time when man first lived
in Britain; and a definite result was attained when borings
made in implement-bearing beds showed the relative chronology
of the period during which palaeolithic hunters had
inhabited the eastern counties. Burial customs revealed
by the opening of barrows and cists, holes drilled in the stones
of dolmens, strange devices sculptured on graves and on
rocks, suggested problems as to the religious ideas of the
Neolithic and Bronze Ages, which the archaeologist, the
ethnographer, and the folklorist attempted to solve. Philologists
studied the Celtic languages, and succeeded in some
measure in deducing from place-names and other relics
of the ancient dialects information bearing upon the history
of the invasions and the distribution of the two great
branches of the Celtic stock.</p>

<p>A great advance was made when the Comparative Method
was brought to bear upon the study of primitive culture.
It was recognized that the antiquities of our own island
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
could not be adequately comprehended without reference
to those of other lands. For at every turn the inquirer
found himself arrested by obstinate questionings. Whence
had the immigrants of the Old and the New Stone Age,
the Bronze Age, and the Early Iron Age set out? Whence
was the knowledge of bronze derived? What was the
starting-point of the culture of the Iron Age? What were
the first beginnings of Late Celtic Art? How was one to
account for the existence in remote countries of this or that
British custom? The British archaeologist who would
intelligently ponder these questions must take account of
the work which has been done by Cartailhac, the brothers
Siret, Bertrand, Edouard Piette, Salomon Reinach, Montelius,
Sophus Müller, Arthur Evans, Ridgeway, Myres,
and Flinders Petrie in elucidating the antiquities of France,
Spain, Italy, Central Europe, Scandinavia, the Aegean Sea,
North Africa, and Egypt; and the British ethnologist
cannot afford to be ignorant of what Broca, Hamy, de
Quatrefages, Salmon, Hervé, Manouvrier, Virchow, Ranke,
and Sergi have done for the ethnology of Europe. Pitt-Rivers
saw that ethnography, which informs us about
the arts and crafts, the manners and customs of surviving
savage tribes, can give archaeology indispensable
aid;<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and all who have compared the contents of the
American Room and the Ethnographical Gallery in the
British Museum with what they have seen in the Prehistoric
Room will believe the Keeper when he assures them that
‘in all probability the resemblance between the perishable
productions of the modern savage and those of prehistoric
man, which are now lost, was as great as that which undoubtedly
exists in the case of implements of stone and
bone which have remained’:<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> but in endeavouring to apply
their knowledge to the elucidation of the antiquities of
a particular country they will not forget to be on their
guard. Nor may we neglect the facts which folk-lore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
societies have in late years so diligently collected; but
those who have learned from the great works of Tylor how
much of primitive custom still lingers in the depths of
modern civilization will become sceptical when they are
invited by less sober reasoners to trace the origin of this or
that surviving superstition to any one race or tribe or period
of the remote past; and readers who have accepted with
enthusiastic admiration the seductive theories of <cite>The Golden
Bough</cite> should weigh well the criticism which Sir Alfred
Lyall, qualified by intimacy with primitive peoples as
well as by a sceptical and cultivated intellect, has published
of that brilliant and truly epoch-making book.</p>

<p>When we have finished our survey of prehistoric times
we shall find that while we can still rely upon the aid of the
archaeologist and the anthropologist, other materials have
been accumulating which will enable us to read our classical
texts with an insight that was impossible for the old-fashioned
historian. The texts themselves have been
purified and restored. Inscriptions have yielded new information
on matters of history, ethnology, and religion;
and the vast labour which has been expended by those
who have striven to elucidate the most interesting of all
subjects cannot wholly fail to help us when we inquire
what the British Celts thought of man’s relation to the
universe. As one scholar after another has noted the
significance of dates recorded in Cicero’s correspondence,
and compared them with the relevant passages in the
<cite>Commentaries</cite> and other ancient writings, chronological
difficulties have gradually disappeared. Physical geography
and geology, supported partly by written documents,
partly by archaeological discoveries, have combined to
reconstruct the map of the coast on which Caesar landed.
Astronomers and hydrographers have perfected our knowledge
of tidal streams, and thereby forged a key which,
for those who possess the indispensable knowledge of seamanship
and of ancient military history, can unlock the
secrets of Caesar’s voyages. Military experts and soldiers
who have served in the field are willing to help us to understand
the story of his campaigns.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>But after the student has digested all the information
which he can extract from books and manuscripts, from
museums, from travel and observation, perhaps from
practical experience in digging, and, above all, from those
who combine learning with knowledge of the world, of
affairs, and of men, he will find that his materials are still,
and on certain points must always remain inadequate.
Some branches of research, indeed, are virtually complete.
All, or nearly all, that sepulchres and skulls and coins can
teach us of Ancient Britain and its inhabitants we know.
Many more implements, weapons, ornaments, and urns
will be accumulated; but it may be doubted whether they
will add sensibly to that knowledge which is really worth
having. But much still remains to be learned. The
geological record is still incomplete; and one of our most
accomplished field-geologists is hopefully looking forward
to a time when it may be possible to determine the uttermost
antiquity of man and to illuminate the dark era that
intervened between the Pleistocene Period and the apparent
commencement of the Neolithic Age.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> His experience
has enabled him to tell archaeologists that in order to
solve chronological problems, they cannot afford to neglect
even the shells which abound in many burial-mounds.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
There is room also for many labourers in excavating stone
circles, camps, and earthworks, and determining their age,
in exploring habitations, wherever they can be found, and
learning what they can teach about those who constructed
them.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> What has been already done in this department
has produced the most fruitful results: the speculations
of Dr. Guest, for instance, in regard to the so-called ‘Belgic
ditches’, have been stultified by pick and shovel.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> But
such work, which in other civilized countries is an object
of national concern, languishes here for want of funds.
No British Government can expect support from the intelligence
and the public spirit of its constituents in spending
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
money upon archaeological research, or has the courage
to give them a lead;<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> and where are the wealthy Englishmen
who will follow the example of their American cousins in
endowing such work?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, enough is already known to justify an
attempt to create a synthetical work, the aim of which shall
be to portray in each successive stage and to trace the evolution
of the culture&mdash;nay, in some sort even to construct
a history&mdash;of prehistoric Britain, and to rewrite the history
of the period which is illustrated by contemporary records.
Not only is the subject fascinating; it is an indispensable
introduction to the history of England. I have tried to
bear ever in mind the interdependence of all the sciences
which can help to restore the past, and to remember the
warning, ‘Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed
lest he fall.’ It is easy to laugh at the guesses of Camden
and the theories of Stukeley; but they were only framing
the hypotheses which are as necessary for the progress of
archaeology as of other sciences; and certain theories
which in our own day have been acclaimed with enthusiasm,
while serving their purpose like theirs, will, like theirs,
be found open to criticism.</p>

<p>But we need not exercise ourselves overmuch in the
region of theory. Though we must be content to remain
ignorant of many things, the story of Ancient Britain,
gaining as it progresses firmness of outline and fullness of
detail, can be constructed upon a basis of fact.

<h3 id="THE_PALAEOLITHIC_AGE">THE PALAEOLITHIC AGE</h3>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg13a" class="sidenote">Reasons for devoting a chapter to the Palaeolithic Age.</div>

<p>A chapter devoted to Palaeolithic Man may perhaps
appear irrelevant to a work the aim of which is to serve
as an introduction to English history; for it has been
questioned whether in this country he left any descendants,
and therefore whether he exercised even the smallest influence
upon the later immigrants. But in France, if not
here, the Palaeolithic merged, perhaps by a long period
of transition, into the Neolithic Age:<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> the neolithic inhabitants
of Britain were of course descended from palaeolithic
ancestors; and in every part of the world in which
it existed the palaeolithic culture was apparently much
the same. There are therefore other reasons besides that
of sentiment for attempting in this book to describe the
life of primitive men and the surroundings in which they
lived: yet sentiment has its weight; for no one who is
not heedless of the past would forget the efforts of those
who, in hard struggle with nature and with fierce beasts,
were the unconscious founders of European civilization.
Without the faith of the Shinto ancestor-worshipper one
may share his daily repeated pious gratitude,&mdash;‘Ye forefathers
of the generations, and of our families, and of our
kindred, unto you, the founders of our homes, we utter the
gladness of our thanks.’<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg13b" class="sidenote">Tertiary man.</div>

<p>The palaeolithic people had acquired a degree of skill in
the manufacture of stone tools which is only attainable by
the most practised modern imitators. But the progress
which they made during the incalculably long period of their
existence was so small that they must have needed ages to
ascend to the level at which we are able to observe them.
Therefore, although no skeletons, no implements have yet
been found which can be referred, in the opinion of all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
experts, to the Tertiary Period, the most sceptical are willing
to believe that man, even if he did not deserve the appellation
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo sapiens</i>, did then wander upon the face of the
earth.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> But how, when he had assumed the erect position
and had begun to make intelligent use of the hands which
gave him such an advantage in contending with other
carnivorous animals more powerful than himself, he learned
slowly and by repeated efforts to chip the flints that he
picked up into serviceable shapes; how in the struggle for
a livelihood the stronger or the more cunning prevailed;
how with developing intelligence came keener susceptibility
to pain as well as to pleasure; how men’s fancies were
quickened by light and darkness, sun, moon, and stars, and
their fears excited by storm and flood and fire; how they
strove to communicate to each other their alarms, their
desires, and their joys&mdash;these things may only be imagined;
and the imagination of those who have read most wisely
and have most observantly studied the ways of modern
savages will lead them least astray.</p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg14" class="sidenote">The Ice
Age.</div>

<p>The Tertiary was merging into the Quaternary or Pleistocene
Period when the climate which had before fostered the
palms and crocodiles whose fossils have been discovered in
the London Clay,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> but had been gradually changing, became
intensely cold. Snow fell thickly upon the mountains
of Scandinavia; glaciers began to creep down the valleys;
and gradually the ice accumulated until it overspread the
whole of Northern Europe, filled the basins of the Baltic
and the North Sea, hid mountains and uplands in
Scotland, and choked the dales of Northern England, of the
Midlands, and of Wales; while isolated glaciers were
formed even so far southward as the valleys of the Beaujolais
and the Lyonnais. The ice has left its record upon the
Highland and Cumbrian mountains, whose rugged crags it
moulded into flowing curves; upon rocks which were
scratched by stones embedded in slowly moving glaciers;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
in the mud, stiff and tenacious, which they deposited as
they grided over many kinds of rocks, and which, being
interspersed with stones, large and small, is called boulder-clay;
in rocks which they transported and dropped far
from their native sites, and by which the directions that they
followed can still be traced; in moraines which mark the
limits of their descent and their recession; in lakes that
were formed, after the ice had disappeared, in glens which
moraines had dammed;<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> in the Arctic plants which survive
on mountains, and in those whose fossil remains have been
found in Norfolk near the level of the sea. In many places
the boulder-clay lies in two or more layers, separated by
stratified sands and gravels, from which it has been generally
inferred that the Ice Age was interrupted by a period&mdash;here
and there by short intervals&mdash;during which the climate
was mild. Told briefly and in general terms, the tale which
a learner might piece together from geological textbooks<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
is something like this. The cold was most intense during
the earlier stage, when the lower boulder-clay was being
deposited, and, little by little, Britain rose until it became
one with the Continent, with Ireland, and with Scandinavia,
and extended far westward into the Atlantic Ocean. Then,
we are told, the ice-sheet that covered Scandinavia was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
six thousand feet thick; and though it became thinner
as it advanced southward, it shrouded the hill-tops in
Scotland, where boulders were lifted right over the water-parting,
and dropped on the western side, and scored
its marks upon rocks in the Lake District at heights of two
thousand five hundred feet; while, spreading over Ireland,
it went out to sea beyond Cork and Kerry, where the wall
of ice broke off and floated away in bergs. Then the land
slowly sank until in the interglacial period only the hills
stood out above the sea, and Great Britain became an
archipelago. Again the movement was upward, though
often interrupted and perhaps not general in extent: the
climate was again becoming severe; and, although the
rigours of the first period were not repeated, local glaciers
crept down the higher valleys north of the Midlands, while
icebergs floated over the parts that remained submerged
and over the North Sea. Now too, as in the earlier period,
the cold was not everywhere continuous: there were
oscillations during which the glaciers alternately advanced
and retreated. As the Ice Age was beginning to near its
end, the land continued to rise until the North Sea, the
English Channel, and the Irish Sea once more disappeared.
In the latest stage of all, when Arctic conditions were
about to vanish even in our northern latitudes, there was
a gradual subsidence: Scotland was lowered about one
hundred feet beneath the present level of the sea, as the
highest ‘raised beach’ along the shores of the great estuaries
testifies; and the waters rushed in over the sinking valley
of the Dover Strait.</p>

<p>Such was the orthodox faith: but the rising geologists
have discarded some of its articles; and even among the
faithful there are pious doubters. Many authorities deny
that the sea-shells which are found on hills in North Wales,
Cheshire, and elsewhere, prove that they were once submerged:
those shells, they insist, were ploughed up by
glaciers out of the sea-floor; and they require us to believe
that they were carried up the sides of the hills to heights
of thirteen hundred and fifty feet above the sea-level.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
although these shells are probably not in their original
position, and the mere presence of marine organisms is no
sufficient proof of former submergence, shells have been
found near Inverness, five hundred feet above the sea,
in the very place where they lived and died. Still, it
does not follow that the submergence which they attest
was interglacial.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Some inquirers believe that the glaciers
advanced and retreated once and no more;<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> that there
was only one slight elevation of the land and one slight
subsidence: others that Britain was not only elevated
twice, but also twice partially submerged; others that it
was finally severed from the Continent in the earlier part
of the Ice Age, when the drainage of Northern Europe,
pouring into the North Sea and barred by the ice-sheet
from escaping northwards, cut for itself a channel across
the isthmus which now lies below the Dover Strait.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> One
expert still insists that when man first entered Britain
the whole country stood at least six hundred feet above
its present level:<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> another, in the same work, denies that its
greatest elevation was more than seventy feet;<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> and their
editor looks helplessly on. One writer suggests that there
may never have been an Ice Age, in the strictest sense of
the term, at all, but only local glaciers, such as now exist
in Greenland.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Another has laboured to show that the
accumulation of ice-sheets ‘merely marked one or more
culminating epochs in a period when the climate was at
least as commonly temperate as Arctic’.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> Others even now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
maintain that not one only, but five interglacial periods
interrupted the intense cold;<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> others again that there was
no interglacial period at all, but only local ameliorations
of climate.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Another fertile theme of controversy has
been the origin of the boulder-clays. But the confession
of a Fellow of the Royal Society, who, as a member of
the Geological Survey, lived in Norfolk for eight years,
studying its geology, suggests that, after all, a sense of
humour may compensate for inability to fathom the mysteries
of the Ice Age. ‘After spending about a year in
Norfolk,’ he says, ‘I began to believe I knew all about
the drifts, but during the following seven years of my
sojourn in that county, as I moved from place to place,
I somehow seemed to know less and less, and I cannot say
what would have been the result, but fortunately the geological
survey of the county came to an end.’<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> Fortunately,
too, it is not essential to our study of palaeolithic man to
decide in every case between the theories of rival geologists.
All admit that in Britain the Thames was the extreme
southern limit of glacial movement, although even in the
southern fringe Arctic conditions prevailed; that glaciers
covered a large part of the country north of the Thames,
and on the higher regions coalesced into ice-sheets: the
view that the lower boulder-clay was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moraine profonde</i>
has at last been generally adopted;<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> while almost all agree
that there was at least one interglacial period, and that
there were climatic variations in certain tracts. Nevertheless
one of the ablest and most experienced of our field
geologists has recently given weighty reasons for his own
conviction that even this solitary age of amelioration
should not be regarded as an established fact.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg19" class="sidenote">Continental
Britain.</div>

<p>But, if we are to study the Palaeolithic Age intelligently,
we must endeavour to test for ourselves the dogma that
Britain was then continental. That dogma has recently
been questioned by geologists who have minutely re-examined
in the field the phenomena of the Glacial Epoch.
Mr. Clement Reid, for instance, holds that in the Palaeolithic
Age England never rose more than seventy feet
above its present level,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> and that men first entered it across
a narrow strait which was formed in the earlier period of
glaciation.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> It is certain that the sea then washed the
coast of Sussex and the western counties; for near Selsea
there is a patch of boulder-clay&mdash;the only one south of
the Thames&mdash;which must have been deposited by shore-ice,
and there are rocks belonging to Bognor or the Isle
of Wight, to the Channel Islands, and to Brittany, which
were transported by icebergs and dropped when they
melted under the summer sun.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> Again, before the first
English boulder-clay was formed Arctic plants flourished
near Cromer; and, says Mr. Reid,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> ‘as these occur just
above the present sea-level, and lie evenly on the strata
below without deeply channelling them, the height of the
land at the commencement of the Glacial Epoch, in Norfolk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
at any rate, must have been almost the same as it is now’.
The same observer assures us that in Southern Britain the
first intense cold was succeeded, after an interval of which
geology has nothing to tell, by an interglacial period in
which the land sunk about one hundred and forty feet
below its present level, so that shingle was deposited on
what is now Portsdown Hill;<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> and that it then gradually
rose until, long before the second glaciation began, its
level, marked by fresh-water and estuarine deposits, once
more virtually coincided with the present line.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> But, he
tells us, at some time after the disappearance of the ice
which deposited the latest boulder-clay of Norfolk the
land stood rather higher than now;<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> and he holds that
even in the early part of the Neolithic Age Britain must
have been almost connected with the Continent, for many
of the river valleys were excavated to depths of from sixty
to seventy feet below the present level of the sea.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> The
submerged forests of Devonshire, Cornwall, and the Bristol
Channel, which contain traces of neolithic handiwork,
flourished at a time when the land stood from fifty to seventy
feet above its present elevation.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>But there are other facts which demonstrate that at
some time after the first period of intense cold&mdash;perhaps
in that interval of which geology has nothing to tell&mdash;the
Continent must have included Britain. As we shall presently
see, not only the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros,
the glutton, and other Arctic animals, but also many species
which prefer a temperate climate, and others which are
now tropical, lived in this country side by side with palaeolithic
man. Nearly all of them had been represented here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
before the earliest glaciers of Scotland were formed.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> But
even on the southern side of the Thames the cold was so
intense during the earlier part of the Ice Age that none
of the tropical, none even of the temperate species could
there have lived: since the land was barren, treeless, and
frozen,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> even the mammoth, protected though it was by
its woolly coat, could have found little food;<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> and large
herds of Arctic animals travelled as far southward as Italy
and Spain.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> It is therefore evident that the beasts of
tropical and of temperate climes whose remains have been
found in the river-drift and in caves along with palaeolithic
implements must have entered Britain after the coldest
period had ceased.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> Moreover, vast quantities of bones
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
of Pleistocene mammals, some of which, such as the reindeer,
have never been found in Britain in preglacial deposits,
have been dredged up out of the bed of the North
Sea, principally from the Dogger Bank;<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> and it is therefore
clear that at some time after the climax of the Glacial
Period that sea or a large part of it did not exist. It cannot
indeed be proved that the men of the river-drift and
the caves entered Britain as soon as the other animals;<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
and possibly the Dover Strait may have existed as a narrow
channel at the time of their arrival: but since the bones
that were raised from the Dogger Bank appear to belong
to the time when the Thames was laying down the gravels
in which men’s tools have been found,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> it seems probable
that the land bridge was standing in some part of the
Palaeolithic Age.</p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg22" class="sidenote">The relation of palaeolithic man to the Ice Age.</div>

<p>It has been demonstrated that palaeolithic men were
living in East Anglia after glaciers had finally disappeared
from that part of the country. The valleys of the Ouse
and its tributaries, in the gravels of which their implements
are to be found, were worn down through boulder-clay.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
Excavations at Hoxne in Suffolk have shown that the
people who left their tools there lived at a time which was
separated by two climatic waves, attested by the flora of
two sets of strata, from the age in which the latest boulder-clay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
of that district had been deposited.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> Moreover, in
many cases in which evidence has been adduced to show
that palaeolithic remains are of glacial or interglacial date,
doubts have arisen either as to the artificial character of
the flints or as to the age of the beds in which they were
found.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> When, for instance, a member of the Geological
Survey announced that he had found palaeolithic implements
at Brandon in Suffolk in three interglacial beds,
separated by layers of boulder-clay,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Sir John Evans suggested
that the clay was not in its original position, but
had slipped down from a higher level.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> Again, Dr. Henry
Hicks and Sir Joseph Prestwich were convinced that the
cave of Cae Gwyn in the Vale of Clwyd had been inhabited
before the climax of the Ice Age.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> Here a flint flake was
taken out of earth separated by a superincumbent bed of
clay from a layer of sand and gravel, above which again
rested boulder-clay that, in Hicks’s judgement, showed no
sign of having ever been disturbed, and which, in the
opinion of Mr. Clement Reid,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> must have been deposited
before the last glaciation of the district. Even this evidence,
however, is not unanimously accepted. Flints have
also been found in the Cromer Forest Bed at East Runton,
which was certainly preglacial; but Sir John Evans cannot
see on them the faintest marks of human workmanship.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is not improbable that when the hunters
whose tools have been exhumed from the drift of South-Eastern
Britain were living in a comparatively mild climate,
Scotland, the Lake Country, and the highlands of Yorkshire
and Wales may still have been partially buried beneath
ice.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> The high-level drift of the Thames valley, which has
yielded so many implements, is believed by eminent geologists
to have been laid down at a time when ice spread
over Northern Britain;<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> and in support of this view it
has been contended that in those regions no palaeolithic
implements have been found.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> The argument cannot be
easily set aside; but it has been pointed out that in the
northern districts, owing to the extreme scarcity of flint,
stone tools could only have been made of harder rocks, on
which it is not so easy to detect marks of human agency;
that the alluvial deposits in those parts are not readily
accessible to search; and that, if they are patiently explored,
implements may yet be recovered from them.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>
Some years, however, have elapsed since this suggestion
was made; and it has not yet been verified. Moreover,
the absence from the country north of Yorkshire, save in
a few preglacial deposits, of such bones as have been found
with palaeolithic remains seems to indicate that the animals
contemporary with palaeolithic man were unable to find
food in Northern Britain owing to the continuance of an
Arctic climate.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> Man was undoubtedly living in Southern
Britain in the cold period that succeeded the so-called interglacial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
period of Sussex and Hampshire; for the plateau
gravels that cap the Bournemouth cliffs, in which his tools
have been found, are older than the valley gravels of the
Hampshire Avon and the Stour, which were formed towards
the end of the Ice Age by torrents that streamed over
frozen chalk downs impervious to water and swept away
the fragments of their crumbling surface.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> Furthermore,
stone implements have been found at Caddington below,
and near London embedded in, a stratum known as ‘contorted
drift’, which is believed to have been formed in
a period of great cold;<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> and it is merely a question of
words whether this period is to be included in the last
phase of the Ice Age.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg25" class="sidenote">‘Eolithic’
man?</div>

<p>But there is one district from which evidence has been
obtained that has convinced many who sought conviction,
that there were men in Britain before the first British
palaeolithic tool was made. In the village of Ightham,
near Sevenoaks, lives a tradesman, named Benjamin Harrison,
whose discoveries have caused much searching of
heart, if they have not revolutionized our knowledge of the
life of early man. In 1885 he began to search for old stone
implements on the chalk plateau between the valleys of
the Medway and the Darent. There, embedded in patches
of gravel that must have been drifted on to the plateau
from hills higher still, which had been already worn down
by denudation even when palaeolithic hunters were roaming
among herds of mammoths in the valley of the Thames, he
found flints of divers shapes which seemed to him to bear
sure traces of man’s handiwork, and which have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
termed ‘eoliths’, or stone implements of a dawning age.
Nearly all of them, indeed, were so rude that the chipping
on their edges has been ascribed by sceptics to the action
of nature. But if even a small fraction of them could be
proved to be authentic, the contention of their finder would
be established. They recur, again and again, in certain
well-defined and peculiar shapes; the chips have in many
cases been removed not from the exposed parts but from
concave sides which, he would have us believe, natural
agents could hardly have affected;<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> if Sir John Evans
and other experts are unable to accept them as artificial,
Canon Greenwell,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> Pitt-Rivers,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> and Prestwich<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> were convinced
that they had been wrought by man; even the
labourers who picked them out of the gravel hardly ever
failed to distinguish them from the surrounding flints;<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>
and, if we may believe the champions of their authenticity,
those who assert that they were shaped by nature have
failed to produce stones of similar forms from the valley-drift.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>
Now when the hunters of the Thames valley were
making their tools, Britain had the same main features of
hill and dale that it has to-day; but when the gravels were
being drifted on to the Kentish plateau, Thames and Medway
were yet unborn; and, filling the great valley that
now lies between the North Downs and the Lower Greensand
hills, some five miles further south, the plateau rose southward
to Central Wealden uplands two thousand feet or
more above the sea. With no special knowledge of geology
the antiquary who spends a holiday in walking from Sevenoaks
or Wrotham on to the plateau may satisfy himself
that this is true. Mingled with the eoliths in the patches of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
drift are fragments of chert that must have been washed
down from the Lower Greensand at a time when it rose
high above the plateau’s level; for south of the eolithic
area, inclining upward below the chalk and below the
Upper Greensand, the outcrop of the Lower Greensand
shows itself still. The plateau drift lies upon rock of preglacial
age;<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> and although there is no evidence that it is
itself older than the Pleistocene period, some geologists
hold that it was deposited soon after, perhaps before, British
glaciers began to form.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>But assuming that the eoliths are artificial, does it follow
that they are older than the oldest palaeoliths, or that they
were wrought by a race different from the men of the
valleys? Mr. Clement Reid has pointed out that the
gravel at Alderbury, some three miles below Salisbury,
in which multitudes of eoliths have been found, is on exactly
the same level as that of a gravel three miles lower down
the valley, where Prestwich picked up a palaeolithic implement
which had fallen from a yet higher elevation.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> If
the position of this implement was an index of its age,
eoliths were being used in Wiltshire after palaeoliths had
begun to be manufactured.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> On the other hand, it is
asserted that eoliths have lately been found in Tertiary
deposits on the high plateau above the Avon;<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> and one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
geologist, who rejects all eoliths, would argue that Benjamin
Harrison’s labours have not been vain. Many palaeolithic
implements have been found on the Kentish plateau, but
never embedded in association with eoliths: most of them
are unworn, and look as if they had remained on the very
spot where they were lost; and it is easy to see that they
are far less ancient than the eoliths. But certain implements
have also been found there which, although they
were not lying in the gravels, appeared to bear marks of
having been derived from them and washed down in the
same drift that contains the eoliths. Like the latter they
were stained deep brown, covered with glacial scratches,
and coated with the white deposit of silica.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> If this argument
had been generally accepted, one might conclude
that the greater antiquity of British man does not depend
for its proof upon the authenticity of the eoliths. What
all admit is that in France flints of eolithic form have been
found even in Tertiary beds.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>But while the extreme antiquity of many eoliths is certain,
the question of their authenticity has recently been debated
with renewed and redoubled vigour. About two years ago
an eminent French palaeontologist, Monsieur Marcellin
Boule, announced that in the process of manufacturing
cement at Mantes many flints had been converted into
eolithic forms;<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> and it has been contended that the conditions
which were actually observed in the factory were
analogous to those of the torrential streams by which flints
may have been dashed hither and thither as they were
swept on to the Kentish plateau in primaeval times.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> An
ardent advocate of the authenticity of eoliths insisted that
some of the Kentish types would be looked for in vain
among the machine-made specimens from Mantes;<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> but
a sceptic affirmed that he had himself found an eolith,
manifestly untouched by man, with its notch accurately
fitting against another stone, the two having been ground
together by a natural process which he described as the
slipping, sliding, and foundering of the insoluble surface
material from higher to lower levels.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> Although it was
objected that certain rectangular eoliths with blunt edges
could not have been produced except by art,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> it is permissible
to doubt whether the human origin of eoliths will
ever be established beyond dispute; and he who reflects
that they have been met with not only in Tertiary beds
but in those immeasurably later deposits which were contemporary
with or but little older than palaeolithic man<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
will leave them for the present without regret to the consideration
of enthusiasts.</p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg30a" class="sidenote">The environment
of palaeolithic
man
in Britain.</div>

<p>Let us then try to conceive of the environment of those
palaeolithic hunters of whose culture we have clearer indications
in a late phase of the Ice Age, when the glaciers of
Southern Britain had passed away. Then the configuration
of the country was very different from that which we
behold. The chalk ranges of Kent and of Picardy were
unbroken. The Thames, fed sometimes by torrential rains,
flowing rapidly and fitfully in the broad shallow valley
which it was excavating, was depositing gravels on the
slopes that bordered it, a hundred feet above the level of
its existing waters,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> and wandering far eastward across a
plain from whose now sunken surface bones of mammoth
and reindeer, of hyena and bear have been dredged, to
swell that greater Rhine which found no outlet till it reached
a far northern sea. Mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses, and
giant elks with antlers ten feet across, roamed in the forests;
hippopotamuses swam in the streams;<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> brown bears and
grizzly bears and lions and hyenas made their dens in
caves, and dragged into their dark and sinuous recesses
the prey which they had torn down in the open.</p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg30b" class="sidenote">Whence
did he
come?</div>

<p>The earlier palaeolithic immigrants, impelled perhaps by
scarcity of game, had crossed the valley of the Dover Strait
doubtless from the nearer parts of France or Belgium; but
the original home of the race is unknown, for palaeolithic
tools have been found not only in this island and almost
every European country except Scandinavia, but also in
North Africa, in the valley of the Nile,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> in Palestine and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Asia Minor, the Euphrates Valley, Somaliland, India, and
North America: as a high authority has remarked, they
are ‘so identical in form and character with British specimens
that they might have been manufactured by the
same hands’;<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> and the same may be said of those which
were wrought by the Tasmanians, who, fifty years ago,
had not yet been exterminated by the pioneers of Christian
civilization.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg31" class="sidenote">Chronological
puzzles.</div>

<p>Many attempts have been made to calculate the number
of millenniums that have elapsed since our Palaeolithic Age
began and since it came to its end. Croll, the author of
the astronomical theory of the Ice Age, finally concluded
that that epoch ceased about eighty thousand years ago;<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>
and Sir Archibald Geikie laboured in his youth to estimate
the time which the rivers would have taken to excavate
their valleys from the days when they were depositing the
high-level gravels to the era when they reached their present
depth.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> But any one who uses his powers of reflection
will see how many elements of uncertainty must stultify
such a method as this;<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> and, since the cause of the Ice
Age remains unknown, the calculations of Croll were futile.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>
Indeed, if it were possible to prove that eighty thousand
years have passed since the beginning or since the end
of the Palaeolithic Age, not much would be gained; for
whose mind can conceive what such a period means?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
The wiser archaeologists have given up the quest of chronological
precision; and they know that the imagination
may be stimulated by more legitimate means. Go to
Caversham and stand upon the gravels washed down by
the Thames in his lusty youth:<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> one hundred and twenty
feet below he is flowing now; think of the ages that passed
while his waters were hollowing out that valley, which
was as it is still before the Palaeolithic Age had passed
away. Walk along the cliff near Bournemouth, and look
out over the Solent Sea. That cliff was once a river bank;
and even the cautious geologist who has described how
Hampshire was wrought into its present form is willing
to believe that man had then appeared in our land. Where
you see salt water he would have seen dry land, bounded
far away by a range of hills which linked the downs of the
Isle of Wight to those that rise behind Weymouth Bay,
and of which the Needles remain as lonely relics: he would
have seen the Solent flow, a mighty river, enriched by the
tribute of the Stour, the Avon, the Itchen, and the Test.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>
Ascend the hill on which stands Dover Castle, and gaze
upon Cape Grisnez. Let the waters beneath you disappear:
across the chalk that once spanned the Channel like a bridge
men walked from the white cliff that marks the horizon
to where you stand. No arithmetical chronology can spur
the imagination to flights like these.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg33" class="sidenote">Palaeolithic
skeletons.</div>

<p>The dwellers on the plateau, if they did exist in preglacial
times, have left us no memorial save their tools:
but can we picture to ourselves the lineaments of the
palaeolithic hunters who came after them? Human
bones, including two perfect skulls, closely associated with
the bones of hyenas, have been recovered from a cave
near Plymouth. The average height of the people to
whom they belonged was little more than five feet: the
skulls have hardly been described with sufficient accuracy
to enable us to compare them with others of the same
period; but, in regard to breadth and to the degree of
projection of the lower jaw, they were not very different
from the majority of modern British skulls.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> Two other
human skulls have been found in England for which palaeolithic
age has been claimed&mdash;one near Swanscombe in
Kent, the other near Bury St. Edmunds; but the former
may not be as old as the bed from which it was unearthed;
and the other was so broken that its contour could hardly
be restored.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> But almost all the older palaeolithic skulls
that have been found in Western Europe belong to the
same type, which is generally called after the famous
specimen that was exhumed nearly half a century ago in
the Neander valley in Rhenish Prussia, and of which the
most characteristic examples were derived from a cavern
at Spy in the province of Namur. The Swanscombe skull
has somewhat similar characters; and it has been supposed
that the earlier palaeolithic inhabitants of Britain belonged
to the Neanderthal race. Unfortunately, however, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
dates of the Neanderthal and Spy specimens cannot be
fixed. The latter may belong to the comparatively advanced
period in which the best palaeolithic stone implements
of France were manufactured: the former was not
seen in place by a competent observer, and its age is quite
uncertain.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> If the very few skeletons that we possess are
typical, these men were short, big-boned, and powerfully
built. Their heads were long and narrow, their foreheads
amazingly low and retreating, and their jaws heavy and
projecting. But their most striking features were enormously
massive and outstanding brow ridges. Although
the Neanderthal skull was described by Huxley as the
most ape-like of all human skulls, and although for some
time after its discovery it was the subject of animated
discussion, it and its congeners were thenceforward regarded
by all anatomists until the beginning of the present century
as human in the strictest sense of the word. Within the
last few years, however, a German anthropologist has
endeavoured to prove that it and the two skulls of Spy
may only be called human in a limited sense: he refuses
to class them under the head of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo sapiens</i>, and refers
them to an older species, which he calls <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo primigenius</i>.
This view, however, has not made influential converts:
the Neanderthal skull was capacious enough to lodge a brain
as large as that of many a living savage; and trained
observers have pointed out that skulls of like contour have
belonged in modern times to men of considerable mental
power.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> A considerable number of skeletons have lately
been discovered in Moravia, which, although like the
Neanderthal race they had long skulls and prominent brows,
belonged to a higher type, and, as the length of their thigh-bones
showed, were of great stature;<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> while the caves of
Baoussé-Roussé, near Mentone, were the resting-place of
very ancient men, in whose skeletons anatomists have
detected certain negroid characteristics, although their skulls
must have contained a large volume of brain.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<span id="PI_CII_Pg35a" class="sidenote">Palaeolithic artists.</span> before its close Britain may well have been invaded by
new races. In the latest period there were living in the
Riviera a people whose physical features connect them
with the earliest French neolithic race; and in South-Western
France skulls of like type have been found at
Laugerie-Basse and Chancelade in the valley of the Lozère.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>
The relics of these men which have been discovered in the
caves in which they dwelled show that some of them were
worthy to be called forerunners of Pheidias and Praxiteles.
With their tools of flint or chert they carved ivory dagger-handles,
or, as we are now assured, objects of uncertain
use,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> adorning them with figures of the heads of reindeer,
and scratched on horns or tusks drawings of mammoths,
deer, horses, and hunters spearing salmon, of which the
finer examples are recognized by modern artists as true
works of art.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> A single specimen, found in the Robin
Hood Cave in Creswell Crags, is all that we can show:<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>
but implements with which it was associated present points
of likeness to those of the French caves which justify the
assumption that the primitive artists of France sent emigrants
to our land.</p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg35b" class="sidenote">Range of
the palaeolithic
hunters
in Britain.</div>

<p>The palaeolithic nomads, whether of the earlier or the
later race, pushed their way as far north as Lincolnshire,
Derbyshire, and Denbighshire, perhaps even into the East
Riding of Yorkshire; and as far west as Glamorganshire,
Caermarthenshire and Devonshire:<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> but almost all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
remains of their handiwork have been found in the south-eastern
district of England,&mdash;in Kent, especially the neighbourhood
of Reculver, Sussex, Hampshire, Essex, Middlesex,
and Surrey, Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and
Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire, Cambridgeshire,
Norfolk, and Suffolk.</p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg36" class="sidenote">Where
their tools
have been
found.</div>

<p>The places in which these relics lay buried may be grouped
in four classes,&mdash;the plateau gravels, already described;
gravels which were apparently deposited not by rivers but
by heavy rains which, falling upon frozen chalk downs,
destroyed the shattered surface and swept it away in
floods;<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> the river-drift, and caves; and, unlike the belongings
of the neolithic herdsmen, those of the older inhabitants
are not to be found, except in special cases, on or near the
surface of the earth. The amateur who has acquired the
rudiments of geology and has learned to discern stone
implements among the fragments of rock which surround
them, knows that in the gravels and sands which rivers
deposited at various elevations when they were flowing
now here now there in higher and wider channels he may
hope to find specimens to add to his collection. Common
sense too teaches him that in the same valley the higher
terraces were formed before the lower, and that the tools
which they contain, however closely they may resemble
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
those which are embedded below, are nevertheless, as
a rule, far older.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> If he asks himself how they found their
way into these gravel beds, reflection will soon suggest the
answer. It would seem that although the palaeolithic
hunters dwelled sometimes near lakes or ponds, they usually
settled on the banks of streams. Fishing, hunting, wading
through fords, warned by swiftly rising floods to quit their
habitations, they lost or abandoned the weapons which
now serve our purpose instead of theirs. But in some cases
beds which contained palaeolithic remains are so situated
that a tiro would never suppose that they had been deposited
by running water at all. Few even of professed
geologists would have thought of searching on the hill-tops
at Caddington, near Dunstable; yet old stone implements
have been found there in profusion. When the men who
made them were alive the hills were valleys, and the valleys
which now lie below the hills did not exist. Nor would
it have occurred to any but a geologist that the tools which
were espied lying at the foot of the cliffs between Reculver
and Herne Bay had fallen from the gravels which line
their summit.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg37" class="sidenote">Inhabited
caves.</div>

<p>Kent’s Cavern and the Brixham Cave, near Torquay,
the Wookey Hole ‘Hyena Den’, near Wells, the Long
Hole Cave in Glamorganshire, and the caves of Creswell
Crags, on the north-eastern border of Derbyshire, are perhaps
the most famous of their class. Heaps of bones have been
found in all of them, which proved that the men who,
from time to time, inhabited them were contemporary,
like those whose tools are recovered from the river-drift,
with animals of which some, like the mammoth, the straight-tusked
elephant, and the ‘sabre-toothed’ tiger, have
disappeared from the face of the earth, and many have
long been extinct in Britain. Generally in the lower strata
the stone tools are exactly like those found in the river-drift;
while in the higher they are as a rule more elaborately
finished, and are associated with needles, harpoons, and
other implements of bone. The same sequence is discernible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
in the palaeolithic caves of France and Belgium.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg38" class="sidenote">Cave implements
and river-drift
implements.</div>

<p>Let us compare in some museum the sets of tools and
weapons which have been taken from caves with those of
the river-drift. Are the latter older than the former, and
is it possible to establish in either or in both a chronological
succession of types? Taken by itself, the form of palaeolithic
implements, at least in this country, is not generally
a criterion of their age; but neither the forms of those
that have come from the caves nor the bones which accompanied
them forbid us to believe that the oldest are at
least as old as any that belonged to the drift. Generally
speaking, the fauna of the caves and of the river gravels
are identical.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> It is therefore certain that, although in
general aspect a collection of implements derived from
the former source is unlike one from the latter because the
two were deposited in different circumstances, some of the
deposits in the drift and in the caves were contemporaneous.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>
Since a few implements of river-drift form have been found
in caves along with those of higher types, it seems reasonable
to conclude that the same men possessed both; and
if those which are characteristic of the caves are almost
entirely absent from the drift, is not the explanation partly
that they were more perishable, partly that many of them
would not have been used in the field? In other words,
there is no reason to believe that the later occupants of
the caves were men of different race or of different habits
from the contemporary hunters whose lost tools have been
given up by the drift.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> Long ago Monsieur de Mortillet
framed a chronological classification of French and Belgian
palaeolithic implements according to their types, which,
though of late years it has been modified, has been provisionally
accepted; but in this country it has been found
impossible to follow his example: the same types exist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
here, but the relative antiquity of the specimens can seldom
be determined; for implements of the oldest French types
have been found in deposits which belong to the close of
our Palaeolithic Age.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> Even when implements from the
high-level terraces are compared with those of the lower,
no marked distinction is observed. In certain cases of
course a local classification has been established. Thus
the stone implements in the upper strata of two of the
caves of Creswell Crags belonged to the advanced type which
is called after the settlement of Solutré in the department
of Saône-et-Loire;<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> and the implements of North-East
London which, from their position at the bottom of the
excavations as well as their colour, were evidently the
oldest, were also inferior in workmanship to newer specimens
found above them some twelve feet beneath the
surface, and far inferior to the newest of the same district,
which were recovered from an old land-surface, two or
three feet below the existing ground, generally called the
‘Palaeolithic Floor.’<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> Again, in the brick-fields of Caddington
excavation revealed an ancient land-surface on
which a palaeolithic colony had made their tools. At
a later time a new surface about two feet higher was formed
by brick-earth, which must have been swept down by heavy
rains from the hills above; and on this more implements
appeared. Above it again is a bed of contorted drift,
containing implements whose deep ochreous colour would
seem to show that of the three series they are the oldest:
evidently they were washed down from the hill-tops on
which perhaps lived the earliest inhabitants of the district,
and which, as they were gradually worn away, formed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
a deposit in what were then valleys, but are now in their
turn hills. The lowest implements, which were of course
older than those next above them, belong to the type called
after the cave of Le Moustier in the valley of the Vezère,
which is itself later than the type associated with the high-level
gravels of the Somme.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> It has been suggested that
when the evidence of plants or of strata is wanting, the
relative age of palaeolithic implements may be provisionally
estimated by the animal remains with which they are
found. The straight-tusked elephant, the ‘big-nosed’
rhinoceros, and the hippopotamus were characteristic, we
are told, of the earliest palaeolithic times;<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> the mammoth,
the woolly rhinoceros, the cave-bear, and the hyena of
a later period; and the reindeer was specially abundant
towards the close of the age. But it is now generally
recognized that if this orderly succession of fauna existed
in Aquitaine, it cannot be distinguished either in our island
or in Northern Gaul. When we find Arctic and tropical
animals commingled, when we see that the bones of big-nosed
rhinoceros and woolly rhinoceros, of straight-tusked
elephant and hyena and reindeer have been dug out of
the same beds,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> we may conclude that it is hardly worth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
while to gauge the antiquity of the works of palaeolithic
craftsmen by such tests as these.</p>

<p>On a general review it should seem that the French
chronological classifications of palaeolithic implements,
even applied to England, contain a measure of truth. The
implements which are commonly found in the river-drift
and other deposits in the open field undoubtedly began
to be manufactured before those which are characteristic
of the caves; and those of Mousterian type were first
made, both in England and in France, long before the
development of the elegant Solutrean forms and the period
in which flourished the artists of South-Western France.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>
But both in France and in England Mousterian implements
were still used during the later period;<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> and even drift
implements of the oldest kind continued to be used by
palaeolithic hunters of the latest generation.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg41" class="sidenote">Divers
forms of
tools.</div>

<p>In order to apprehend the culture of the palaeolithic
races, it is necessary to be conversant with the forms of
their tools. The great majority were made of flint; but
in places where flint was scarce or difficult to obtain other
stones, for example, chert, quartzite pebbles, sandstones,
and felstone, were used. The principal forms were flint
flakes, which were probably intended to serve as knives,
sometimes even as saws (for a few of them are serrated),<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>
and, in certain instances, as scrapers for dressing hides;
implements or weapons, pear-shaped or tongue-shaped in
outline, more or less acutely pointed, and more or less
truncated at the butt, some of which look like spear-heads,
though they may have been grasped in the hand; and
oval, almond-shaped, and occasionally heart-shaped or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
triangular implements, which have a cutting edge all round.
Each of these forms of course comprises many varieties,
not only in contour but also in the mode of chipping; and
a few tools of abnormal shapes have also been found, as
well as natural blocks of flint, called ‘hammer-stones’,
which were used in the process of manufacture, and most
of which were slightly trimmed in order to make them
more serviceable. Near Ipswich a lady has recently discovered
a tiny implement which, it has been fondly suggested,
some hunter may have wrought as a toy for his
child.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> Among the bone implements were harpoons, barbed
sometimes on one, sometimes on both sides, which have
been found in Kent’s Cavern and other caves, and which
closely resemble those that are used by the Eskimos of our
own day; and needles drilled by bone awls, with eyes so
small that the threads of reindeer sinew which they received
could hardly have exceeded a thirtieth of an inch in diameter.
Moreover, it is more than probable that clubs,
wooden tools, and utensils and vessels of skin were also used,
which, from their perishable nature, have long since disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg42" class="sidenote">Palaeolithic
workshops.</div>

<p>The explorations of antiquaries have revealed more than
one of the open-air workshops in which the primitive tool-makers
plied their trade. Near Crayford, on a sandy
beach beneath an old chalk cliff that overhung the Thames
when on its southern side its bed was nearly two miles
wider, excavation discovered the surface, strewn with
flint flakes, in actual contact with mammoths’ bones, on
which the workers had lived and toiled until a great flood
drove them away, leaving the sediment which for countless
ages concealed their remains. The inferior quality of the
flint showed that they had not known how to win it by
mining from the rock, but had been obliged to content
themselves with such stray blocks as they could find. The
enthusiast who discovered the site was actually able to fit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
many of the flakes together, and to reconstruct the original
blocks from which they had been struck off.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> At Caddington,
where hammer-stones and punches, great blocks of flint
which had been used as anvils, and innumerable flakes and
cores bore their silent testimony, Mr. Worthington Smith
inferred from the confusion in which finished and unfinished
tools were left that the settlers, terrified perhaps by some
violent storm, had suddenly quitted their abode. He
found an implement which had been ruined by an ill-directed
blow of the hammer, and one which had been re-flaked
and re-pointed by a later worker; and his practised eye
detected that the craftsmen had flaked their tools differently
from those of Crayford.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> Speaking generally, however,
the methods of working were the same as those which
are still followed by the ‘knappers’ of Brandon in
Suffolk, who manufacture gun-flints for African savages.
The flakes which were to be used as knives or scrapers were
detached from the blocks by a stone hammer; and the
larger implements were trimmed into the various shapes
which have been described, by blows along their edges,
which chipped off small splinters. The effect of the hammer
was to produce on the flake, just below the point where the
blow was delivered, a protuberance, which is called the
‘bulb of percussion’, and which of course left a corresponding
cavity on the block from which the flake was detached.
This bulb is the mark by which a manufactured flint may be
recognized; but on tools whose artificial origin is manifest
even to an untrained eye it has often been obliterated by
the process of chipping.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg44" class="sidenote">Handles.</div>

<p>Inquisitive antiquaries have raised the question whether
any palaeolithic implements were furnished with handles.
The Tasmanians simply grasped their tools in their hands;<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>
and there is little evidence that the Britons mounted theirs:<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
but the triangular sharply-pointed flints which have been
already described might sometimes have been used as arrow-points
or javelin-heads.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> Some were doubtless missiles and
nothing more.</p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg45a" class="sidenote">Uses of tools.</div>

<p>But, as experts who have passed their leisure in recovering,
comparing, and classifying these things confess, it is impossible
to define the various purposes to which this or
that stone tool was applied. ‘Who,’ says Lord Avebury,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>
‘could describe the exact use of a knife?’ We only know
that with his rude implements the palaeolithic hunter did
all the work that his hand found to do,&mdash;felled trees, chopped
wood to feed his fire, dug up esculent roots, scooped out
canoes, killed and cut up the animals on which he subsisted,
skinned them and dressed their hides to clothe himself withal,
encountered his enemies in battle, and defended himself in
conflict with the beasts against which his keen sight and
hearing, his intellect, and these weapons, which it enabled
<span id="PI_CII_Pg45b" class="sidenote">Culture of the palaeolithic inhabitants of Britain.</span> him to fashion, were his sole protection.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> Yet as we look
at the tools in a museum, nearly the same at the end as
the beginning of our immeasurably long Palaeolithic
Age, we marvel even more at the mental stagnation of the
primeval savage than at the skill which he had laboriously
attained; and we wonder how it was that men who had
learned to chip their blocks of flint so accurately remained
content, generation after generation, with the art which
they had acquired, and never thought of grinding the cutting
edge against another stone and thus producing a better and
sharper weapon. ‘We see in our own times,’ wrote Sir
Charles Lyell,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> ‘that the rate of progress in the arts and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
sciences proceeds in a geometrical ratio as knowledge increases;
and so, when we carry back our retrospect into the
past, we must be prepared to find the signs of retardation
augmenting in a like geometrical ratio.’ It would seem
that in the Palaeolithic Age men had no pottery and grew
no corn: they certainly had no cattle; and, though they
lived by hunting, they had no dogs.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> Perhaps they sometimes
dug pits to trap their game; for one of the engravings
from La Madelaine may have been intended to depict
a beast impaled upon a wooden stake.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> Their numbers
must have been very small; for people who live by the
chase alone require for their sustenance forests of vast
extent.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> Some, as we have seen, lived in caves; others,
as we may infer from the remains that have been picked up
beneath the cliffs of Oldbury,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> by Sevenoaks, under projecting
ledges of rock; generally perhaps, and especially
in districts in which no caves were available, the dwellings
were huts or shelters made of trees and boughs. Some of
the bones that were found in Kent’s Cavern, some even of
the gravels that have yielded eoliths,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> show traces of fire,
which was probably produced by the friction of sticks or by
striking flint against iron pyrites;<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> and one is tempted to
infer that the hunters or their women learned to make their
food more palatable by cooking. The numberless fractured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
bones which were strewed in the caves had evidently been
pounded for the sake of the marrow, which in every age
was a dainty dish for prehistoric folk; and in the closing
period, when harpoons had been invented, men were able
to vary their diet of meat and herbs and wild fruit with
divers kinds of fish. By that time too they had acquired
the art of sewing, and doubtless they made themselves
coats of skins, perhaps even, like the cave-dwellers of the
Pyrenees, long gauntlets of fur;<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> while fossils that have
been found with natural holes artificially enlarged may
justify the assumption that, like the cave-dwellers of France,
they adorned themselves with necklaces.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> The figure of
a horse engraved on a bone that was disinterred from one
of the Creswell caves suggests, as we have seen, that in
this country, as in France, there were men who were not
destitute of the artistic faculty: but this solitary specimen
can hardly compare with the best of the drawings that
delighted the explorers of the contemporary French caves.
It is difficult for any one who looks at these life-like sketches
to believe that those who made them were not inspired by
love of art; but the ingenuity of a modern archaeologist,
who observes that the Australian aborigines scratch on rocks
the likenesses of animals as charms to promote their fecundity,
has suggested that they were merely talismans intended
to supply the hunter with abundant game. As he insists<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a>
that the animals which the artists represented were all
edible, one may fairly ask whether they were accustomed
to feed upon the glutton,<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> the serpent, and the wolf;<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> whether
they counted each other as legitimate prey; what could
have been the utilitarian motive for depicting an otter
chasing a fish;<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> and what was the object of engraving the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
strange quasi-human creature which the antiquary who
discovered it in the cavern of Mas d’Azil described as an
‘anthropomorphic ape, nearer akin to man than the anthropoids
that we know’.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> Nevertheless it is not improbable
that religion, which has stimulated savage as
well as mediaeval and modern art, may have been one of
the motives of the cave-dwellers; and perhaps the artist
was sometimes a magician, though it would be idle to
speculate on the purpose of his spells.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>Disciplined imagination, working upon a basis of ascertained
fact, may help one to picture the lives of those
primitive inhabitants of our island. We can see them
returning at evening to the fires which their women had
kindled, and which served at once to warm them, to cook
their food, to keep off beasts of prey, and to scare away the
malignant spirits of whom, if they were like other savages,
they were yet more in dread. We may see a vast herd of
reindeer crossing the ford at Windsor, and wolves watching
for their chance to spring upon stragglers. We may hear
the trumpeting of the elephant, the roar of the lion, the
bellowing of the wild bull, the howl of the hyena, the snort
of the hippopotamus, as it splashed or swam in the waters
of the Thames or the Ouse. We may imagine the hunter
striving by sign, or gesture, or rudimentary language,
to express his delight when he has succeeded in the chase,
his despair when ill success leaves him and his to pine with
hunger, his terror when the eclipsed moon turning to red,
when flood, or lightning, or pestilence warns him that the
spirits of nature are wroth, his grief when bear, or bison,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
or famished wolf has slain his wife or child. How he disposed
of his dead he has left no sign: but in the caves near
Mentone, which were inhabited in successive periods of
the Palaeolithic Age, there were evidences that the corpses
had been decently interred;<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> and the skeletons found in
Moravia<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> had been carefully protected by a rampart of
stones.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg49" class="sidenote">Religion.</div>

<p>Had the primitive people of Britain any religion, or any
ideas that contained the germs of religious belief? It is
not enough to point to modern savages like the Tasmanians,
whose material culture was lower than that of the palaeolithic
Britons, but who certainly believed in a spiritual
world.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> The cave-dwellers of Mentone were interred with
their implements and ornaments, perhaps intended for use
in a future state;<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> but such evidence is not forthcoming
here. The painted pebbles, however, and the ‘bull-roarers’
which were treasured in the caves of South-Western France
may well have had analogues among the inhabitants of this
island<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> who were in the same stage of culture; and doubtless,
like the similar objects which are shown by the natives of
Central Australia, they were connected, more or less closely,
with religious ideas.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> No savage tribe, indeed, has yet
been observed of whom it can be proved that they were
without religion; for some travellers who have affirmed
the contrary have been unable to comprehend ideas which
differed wholly from their own; some have recorded facts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
which gave the lie to their own denial; some have confessed
that after long intercourse they had discovered the existence
of beliefs which they had never suspected; and all who
have been qualified by tact and sympathy to deal with
savages have recognized how hard it is to induce them to
disclose their inmost thoughts.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> But much depends upon
the sense in which the word Religion is to be understood.
The great anthropologist whose writings have given the
most powerful impetus to the study of primitive culture
has taken as his ‘minimum definition of religion’ the
belief in spiritual beings;<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> and although it might be rash to
affirm that materialism is inconsistent with religion, and no
sympathetic reader would deny that the Latin poet who
denounced ‘foul religion’ with such fierce earnestness had
a religion of his own, Professor Tylor’s words may serve as
our guide.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> It is true that the conception of a spiritual
being formed by a primitive mind has hardly anything in
common with that approved by a theologian or a philosopher:
for the savage, as for Tertullian and Origen, spirits are not
immaterial; they are exceedingly subtle, but still corporeal.
Nor, indeed, are they necessarily immortal. Savage religion
is utterly different from that which has been the guide
of life to men who, though they had put away all hope of
everlasting life, retained their sense of the nobility of human
nature,&mdash;‘to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,
and to keep himself unspotted from the world’;
utterly different from that which inspires the idealist to
whom theology is a vain thing and the supernatural unreal,
but who clings to his belief that man’s punishment or reward
hereafter is simply to be what he has become, that his destiny
is to grow in grace, lapsing perhaps, but again aspiring,
until his spirit becomes one with the indwelling spirit of
God. Yet, although the orthodox may refuse the name of
religion to an animism begotten of fear and unconnected
with ethics, though idealists may scoff at the conception
of spiritual beings which invests them with bodily form and
ponderable and mortal albeit ethereal substance, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
animism was the seed out of which their own faith&mdash;its
framework but not its nobler part&mdash;was evolved.</p>

<p>He whose mind is informed by the teaching of ethnography
may conceive, if he has a sympathetic imagination, the
mental state that gave birth to primitive religion; but if
his reading has not been wasted, he will understand how
vain would be the attempt to ascribe to this or that prehistoric
people any known savage creed. For, alike in origin
and in essence, the forms of modern animism are manifold.
To the palaeolithic Briton fire, leaping roaring and devouring,
devastating flood, rushing wind, lightning flash, disease,
death itself,&mdash;all may have been animated by spirit, or have
been themselves spiritual beings. Elves, goblins, phantoms
may have been created by his brain, and have seemed to
flit before him when prolonged fasting had stimulated the
creative power of his fancy. The conceptions that were
ultimately to become the greater gods of polytheism may
have arisen in his mind as in the minds of other savage
men. At least we may believe that, unless he differed greatly
from the modern savages whose handiwork resembles his,
he began to people the universe with spiritual beings when
he became conscious of his own soul; that the phantasms
which he saw in dreams were for him real and alive; that
every spirit in which he believed originated in the curiosity
that led him to seek the cause of every natural phenomenon;
that, although social friction had compelled him to recognize
a moral code, his religion and his morality were not one but
two, not mutually supporting but distinct; and, finally,
that no thought of future retribution or reward troubled
or comforted his heart.</p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg51" class="sidenote">Totemism.</div>

<p>Intimately connected with primitive religion is totemism,
that strange institution which has been observed in various
stages of survival among the North American Indians,
the forest tribes of South America, the aboriginals of Western
and Central Australia, the Malays, the hill-tribes of Central
India, certain Mongoloid tribes of Central Asia, in Bechuanaland,
and in the Bantu district of South Africa;<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
in every case began before those whom it affected had come
to domesticate animals, to till the earth, or to fashion
pottery;<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> and which tends to decay when hunting gives
place to pasturage.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> One cannot but inquire whether an
institution so widespread existed among the prehistoric
inhabitants of Britain; and, although no distinct case of
totemism has been found or recorded in Europe,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> the inquiry
is not perhaps so hopeless as it may at first sight appear.</p>

<p>The leading principles of totemism have been so often
defined that they are doubtless familiar to many readers.
Evidently it originated at a time when men were not possessed
by the fancy that they were a distinct branch of creation,
but felt their kinship with other animals, which they
had hardly begun to regard as inferior.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> The members of
the clans which form a totemic tribe trace their descent
generally from some animal, sometimes even from a plant
or an object which we should call inanimate, and bear its
name. But how did the conception of relationship between
a clan and an animal or vegetable species arise? It has been
suggested that metempsychosis may supply the explanation.
Some great man perhaps gave out that after his death no
hare was to be eaten by his clan because a hare would be
possessed by his soul. Thus not only his own children and
grandchildren but also hares would be his descendants;
and he would be the founder of a totem-family, which
might develop into a totem-clan.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> On the other hand, it
has been argued that when totemism began descent was
necessarily reckoned in the female line, and that it is therefore
useless to search for its origin in anything&mdash;for example,
‘a paternal soul tenanting an animal’&mdash;which was deemed
to be inherited from a male ancestor.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>Until a recent date it was an article of faith among
anthropologists that, except in special circumstances, the
life of a totem-animal was, in the eyes of the clan which
belonged to it, sacred, and that marriage between the
members of any one clan was absolutely tabooed. If a
clansman of a Crocodile clan desired a wife, he must seek
her from a Wolf clan or from some other. But within the
last few years totemism has been carefully and minutely
observed among the Arunta tribe of Central Australia;
and the records of these observations mark a new era in
anthropology. With the Aruntas totemism does not forbid
the slaughter of the totem-animal and does not prescribe
exogamy: it is based upon the belief that they are descended
from ‘quasi-human animal or vegetable ancestors,
whose souls are still reborn in human form in successive
generations’.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> It has, however, been maintained that in
the organization of this tribe there are still discernible traces
of totemism of the primitive type, involving both exogamy
and respect for the life of the totem-animal;<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> and also
that their totemism is so decadent that nothing can be
learned from it as to totemic origins.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>Totemism is indeed a subject of extraordinary difficulty:
its literature is enormous and rapidly growing; and it is
out of the question in this book to do more than point out
its problems, and put the reader in the way of pursuing
the study for himself. The problem of its origin can never
be solved with certainty; for the institution cannot now be
observed in its primitive state; and any attempt to trace
it backward must start from conjecture as to the original
social condition of man.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> Perhaps the most plausible and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
ingenious theory rests upon the assumption, for which
considerable evidence has been adduced, that groups of
men originally designated one another by animal and plant
names, and that these names were accepted even when they
were bestowed in derision. Such a group, finding itself
called, let us say, by the name of the pig, and not knowing
how it had come by the name, would naturally believe
that there was an intimate connexion between itself and
the porcine species.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> The taboos which forbade the slaughter
of the totem-animal and marriage between a man and a
maiden of the same kin would, it is argued, follow when once
the universal belief, that ‘the blood is the life’ and therefore
sacred, was evolved.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

<p>There are superstitions and names which suggest that
totemism may once have existed in Britain; but even if
their evidence is accepted, it is of course impossible to point
out the source from which they were ultimately derived.
They may have belonged to our early Neolithic Age, or they
may have been introduced later, when totemism had died
out, by invaders who had received them from inferior
tribes with whom they came in contact. We are assured
that Cornish fishermen believe that drowning men sometimes
assume the form of animals;<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> that in the village of
Burchurch in Shropshire it is deemed unlucky to kill a bat;<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a>
that at Great Crosby in Lancashire the goose is held sacred;<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
and that certain Scottish clans derived their names from
animals.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> The familiar passage in which Caesar observes
that the Britons counted it impious to taste the flesh of
hares, fowls, and geese<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> has also been interpreted as a
survival of totemism.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> But this is a mere guess. The
greatest of anthropologists has warned us not to assume
that every sacred animal is a totem:<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> the association
with a clan of a species of animals is only one form of
animal-worship. It is, however, quite possible that if
these animals had once been totems, they were revered by
clans with whom the ancestors of the British Celts had
mixed before they emigrated from Gaul; for broken bones
of the hare, which were found in one of the caves of Perthi-Chwareu
in Denbighshire, show that at all events in that
part of neolithic Britain the animal was eaten.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg55" class="sidenote">Was the
domestication of
animals a
result of
totemism?</div>

<p>Some anthropologists have argued that the domestication
of animals and even agriculture resulted from totemism.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a>
Thus Monsieur Reinach insists that the domestication of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
the boar is an irrefragable proof of its former sanctity;
for, he argues, if men had always thought themselves
entitled to kill and eat boars, boars would never have
multiplied under human protection, and become the ancestors
of domestic swine. Domestication, he considers, implies
a long truce between men and animals, something analogous
to the Golden Age, celebrated by poets of antiquity, in which
men were vegetarians. One may be pardoned for maintaining
a sceptical attitude towards a theory which is obviously
incapable of proof, which to men who live remote from
libraries but in the midst of animals presents insuperable
difficulties, and which, moreover, seems to imply that prehistoric
tribes were excessively stupid. If it were true, one
would expect to find that oxen, sheep, and pigs had been
reared in the Palaeolithic Age, and that modern totem
groups had domesticated or were now domesticating totem
animals. But the only animal which the cave-dwellers
of South-Western France apparently domesticated was
the horse, which was doubtless lassoed and fastened not
because it was sacred but for food;<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> and the Aruntas have
no domestic animals. A hungry Australian would have no
scruple in killing and eating an animal, not belonging to
his own totem-species, which by his wife would be deemed
sacred: the Bantus have sheep and oxen, but neither the
ox nor the sheep is among their totems. What motive
could savages have had for keeping totem-animals in
captivity in large numbers unless they had desired to eat
their flesh or to drink their milk, and why should they have
toiled to provide food for them in winter? Why should
the domestication of any species be impossible unless the
lives of the animals were spared for a long term of years;
and why, if every bull and ram were suffered to gratify
its sexual instincts unchecked, and cows and ewes were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
unmilked and unused, should they become tame.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> It is
surely not incredible that primitive hunters, not belonging
to Bull or Boar clans, who saw that wild oxen and wild
boars were good for food, should have conceived the idea
of ensuring a more constant supply by trapping young
animals, taming them, and breeding from them. Totemism
may conceivably have had some influence upon the domestication
of animals; but it seems probable that there was
room for common sense.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> And the mere fact that a piece
of sculpture representing an ear of barley was found in a
cave at Lourdes hardly seems sufficient to justify the conclusion
that barley was an object of worship in the Palaeolithic
Age, and that its subsequent cultivation was due to
totemism.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> What we may safely conclude is that exogamy,
with which totemism is commonly associated, although
they may have been originally distinct, was one of the
chief factors in consolidating groups and allying them
together.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg57" class="sidenote">Magic.</div>

<p>The subject of totemism naturally leads on to that of
magic; for in Australia totemic groups have developed
into co-operative magic-working societies; and there is
no rashness in assuming that magic flourished everywhere
before the end of the Palaeolithic Age. We are often
told that magic was based upon a confused association of
ideas; that it was the embryo of science;<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> and that priest
and magician have ever been foes. There is much truth in
this: but magic is not to be so easily explained; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
most of us are still far from sympathetically understanding
the mental state in which it originated. To say that one
kind of magic is an outgrowth of the law of similarity, the
magician fancying, for example, that by making drawings
of animals he can cause their species to multiply; that
the other depends upon the law of contact, when, for instance,
it is supposed that whatever is done to a weapon
will correspondingly affect the person whom it wounded,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>&mdash;to
say this is not to fathom the magician’s mind. Magic,
notwithstanding the hostility with which priests have regarded
magicians, cannot be separated from religion by
a line of demarcation; nor indeed is it always possible to
differentiate magicians from priests.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> It has been well
said that magic, as observed among primitive tribes, is
‘part and parcel of the “god-stuff” out of which religion
fashions itself’.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> Australian magicians believe that their
powers are conferred upon them by supernatural beings;<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>
and the magicians of many tribes call upon spirits to aid
them in working their spells.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> One of the most important
functions of the magician is to ensure an adequate fall of
rain; but in New Guinea this duty belongs to the priest
of the god by whose favour the rain is believed to fall.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a>
Vast learning has been expended to prove that monarchy
originated in magic;<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> but we only know that magicians
have sometimes succeeded in making themselves kings;<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>
and doubtless in certain cases magic may have helped to
sow the seed out of which gradations of rank were evolved.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>
But this would be but one more illustration of the accepted
truth that family, tribe, priesthood, monarchy&mdash;all our
institutions&mdash;are rooted in savagery.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<div id="PI_CII_Pg59" class="sidenote">Was there
a ‘hiatus’
between
the Palaeolithic
and the
Neolithic
Age?</div>

<p>The close of the British Palaeolithic Age is veiled in
obscurity. ‘Mesolithic’ implements, whose form might
show that they belonged to a period of transition between
Palaeolithic and the Neolithic Age, have been diligently
sought for; and some of the seekers insist that they have
found them:<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> but the claim has not won general acceptance;
and even if it could be established, a doubt would remain
whether the makers of those implements belonged to the
palaeolithic race of Britain or to a race which had come
from abroad after our Palaeolithic Age had passed away.
In the words of a high authority<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> ‘there appears, in this
country at all events, to be a complete gap between the
River-drift and Surface Stone Periods, so far as any intermediate
forms of implements are concerned; and here at
least the race of men who fabricated the oldest of the palaeolithic
implements may have, and in all probability had,
disappeared at an epoch remote from that when the country
was again occupied by those who not only chipped but
polished their tools.’ It has been urged by those who would
extend this characteristically guarded conclusion that out
of forty-eight mammalian species which were living in
Britain in the older, only thirty-one survived into the later
period; that Britain was united with the Continent in the
former, and was an island in the latter; and that in caves
which were inhabited in both periods the strata that contained
palaeolithic remains were separated by a layer of
stalagmite, the formation of which would have required
many centuries, from the upper neolithic stratum. But
all these arguments do not prove that there was a breach
of continuity between the two ages. If seventeen mammalian
species perished, thirty-one did survive. If Britain
was continental in the Palaeolithic Age and insular in the
Neolithic, the contrast does not exclude the possibility
that man survived with his fellow animals from the former
into the latter: at the time when the Hoxne implements
were lost the land stood only a few feet above its present
level,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> and a strait must have separated Britain from Gaul;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
nor, on the other hand, is it absolutely certain that the
earliest neolithic immigrants did not cross the Channel
valley on foot. And if the stalagmite which lay between
palaeolithic and neolithic implements proved that in certain
caves the stage of culture represented by the lower strata
was separated by a vast gulf of time from that represented
by the higher, it still remains possible that some descendants
of the primitive hunters may have survived to meet the
neolithic invaders. Whoever maintains that there was
a ‘hiatus’ between the two stone ages in Britain must
frame some theory to account for the disappearance of the
palaeolithic race. Either they must have been utterly
destroyed by some cataclysm which could hardly have been
less fatal to the thirty-one mammalian species that survived;
or they must have been struck down by a pestilence, such as
has never been recorded, that spared none; or they must
have died out, although there was no civilized race to expedite
their fate; or they must one and all have emigrated for
some reason which cannot be explained. It is true that in
the valley of the Lea near London and at Caddington the
old land-surface on which they lived is covered by ‘contorted
drift’, above which no undisturbed palaeolithic relics have
been found; and it has been supposed that the cold to
which the formation of this deposit was due forced the
inhabitants to migrate southward. But this evidence has
not been taken seriously; and it has also been suggested
that the emigration, if it took place, was caused by an outbreak
of disease, which, if it was real, may have been merely
local. Again, it has been asserted by the most persistent
advocate of discontinuity that the ‘cave men’ fled in terror
before neolithic persecutors;<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> that their line of retreat
is indicated by implements in the caves of Germany and
in refuse heaps of Siberia; and that the extinction of certain
mammals and the flight of others was due to the change
of climate which resulted from the new-born insularity of
Britain.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> But if the cave-men were driven away by neolithic
invaders, what becomes of the alleged hiatus? why
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
should implements in Germany and Siberia be connected
with British fugitives? and if mammals abandoned Britain
because it had become an island, how did they get away?
Somewhere or other the newer was evolved from the older
culture: the palaeolithic skeletons which have been found
in the caves near Mentone are not distinguishable from
those of the same Ligurian coast which were interred in
the Neolithic Age;<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> and evidence from stratified deposits
in the valley of the Seine, lying one above another in unbroken
succession, as well as the remarkable discoveries at
Mas d’Azil and in the Riviera, have convinced the anthropologists
of France that in their country a hiatus
did not exist.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> Therefore those of us who cling to the
belief that the neolithic immigrants who first ventured
to launch their frail canoes on the narrow Channel and
ran them aground on the Kentish coast may have found
the new-born island inhabited by men of an older race
have some reason to show for our pious faith.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg62" class="sidenote">The early neolithic immigrants.</div>

<p>No one can say how long after the close of the Ice Age the
first neolithic immigrants appeared;<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> nor can it even be
positively affirmed that in Northern Britain the last glacier
had then melted away. If they sailed across the Dover
Strait, it was, as we have seen, extremely narrow; and
we can hardly be sure that it existed at all.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> Neolithic
hunters, who may not have belonged to the earliest horde,
roamed in forests which now lie buried beneath the Bristol
Channel and the waves that break upon the Land’s End;<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a>
and from the depths at which their remains have been dug
up it may be reasonably inferred that Southern Britain
then extended at least as far as the line which is marked
upon our maps and charts by the ten-fathom contour.
But while in England the land stood above the modern level,
in Scotland it lay below; for along the margin of the fifty-foot
raised beach there are heaps of refuse left by men
who lived at a time when the estuary of the Forth ran up to
Falkirk, and the lands which form the Carse of Stirling were
submerged:<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> dug-out canoes have been found embedded
in the basin of the Clyde more than twenty feet above the
present high-water mark;<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> and in a cave which was discovered
by quarrymen in a cliff facing the bay of Oban,
a hundred yards from the existing beach, dwelled hunters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
and fishermen, whose mode of life is attested by their deer-horn
harpoons, the remains of the oxen and deer on which
they partly subsisted, and the bone pins with which they
fastened their clothing.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> The character of the relics has
led experts to the conclusion that the people to whom they
belonged were among the earliest of the neolithic inhabitants
of Western Europe; indeed it may be that they were descendants
of a British or a Pyrenaean palaeolithic stock. The
harpoons are of the same type as those which in the caves
of South-Western France are assigned to the close of the
Palaeolithic Age and to a time of transition between it and
the following epoch, and which in recognized neolithic
deposits have never been found either in Britain or in Gaul;
and the general aspect of the Scottish and the Gaulish
remains is virtually the same.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> There are, moreover,
other indications that the British Neolithic Age began long
before the period to which the great majority of the antiquities
that lie in our museums belong. A few years ago
there were brought to light traces of a settlement which
some primitive clan had formed on the bank of a stream
that flows through Blashenwell Farm, hard by Corfe Castle.
These settlers had lived in great part upon limpets, which
they must have eaten raw, since the broken shells showed
no trace of fire: they did not till the soil; they had no
domestic animals and no pottery; and their tools were of
the rudest kind.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> Moreover, besides the implements that
lay beneath the submerged forests, there have been found in
the bed of the Trent, and in the Ham Marshes, thirty feet
below the surface, skulls which are so far different from
those that have been recovered from barrows and cairns
as to suggest that the oldest neolithic invaders may have
belonged to another stock.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg63" class="sidenote">The origins

<p>But whoever they may have been, whatever the date
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
of their arrival, it was an era since which the history of this
country has been continuous. Their descendants are with

of cereals and plants which are cultivated still, and animals
the descendants of which still stock our farms; they practised

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg64a" class="sidenote">Geography of

Britain.</div>

<p>The subsidence which is proved by the submerged forests
was going on throughout the Neolithic Age, and only
ceased about three thousand years ago. While the forests
were insensibly sinking, the valleys that stretched behind
them were flooded by the advancing sea, which penetrated
through the chalk downs into the Weald in long fiords,
and doubtless often carried the canoes of the later invaders.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>
But we cannot fix even approximately the period at which
these people began to arrive.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> All that can be said is that
it was many centuries before the Bronze Age, which probably
began in this country about eighteen hundred years before
the Christian era.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg64b" class="sidenote">Who were
the later
neolithic
invaders?</div>

<p>These hordes doubtless set out from various parts of
northern Gaul; but to determine their origin is perhaps
impossible.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> The skeletons that have been exhumed from
the neolithic tombs of England, Scotland, and Ireland,
except some which were interred in the very latest period,
when invaders of a widely different race were beginning to
arrive, belong, for the most part, to the same general type.
All, or almost all, had long narrow skulls: their faces were
commonly oval, their features regular, and their noses
aquiline: most of them were of middle height, and their
limbs, as a rule, were rather delicate than robust. Men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
with the same physical characters lived contemporaneously
in Gaul and the Spanish peninsula, and are still numerous
in the basin of the Mediterranean; and the race to which
they belonged is often called the Iberian, though there
is no reason to believe that its British representatives
belonged to the Iberian rather than to some other branch
of the Mediterranean stock.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> But it is remarkable that
while early in the Neolithic Age Gaul and Spain, as well
as Central Europe, were overrun by invaders of a totally
different kind, who were extremely short and sturdy and
had broad round heads, there is no evidence that men of
this race reached Britain until the very end of the period,
and then only in comparatively small numbers.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> One
would be inclined to infer that tribes of the Mediterranean
stock began to migrate into Britain before many of the
round-headed race had settled in Gaul. Vain attempts
<span id="PI_CIII_Pg65" class="sidenote">Evidence from dolmens.</span> have been made to trace the migration to its original
starting-point by the distribution of the dolmens, or rude
stone sepulchres,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> which are found in many European
countries. A dolmen, in the strict sense of the word, is
composed of large stones set on end, which wholly or
partially enclose a space, and are covered by other stones
or by a single stone, which rests upon their upper ends.
Most of the chambers in our chambered barrows virtually
answer to this definition; and if the enclosing mounds
were removed, would appear as dolmens.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> Some few,
however, as well as chambers which have been explored in
Brittany, were roofed over, like the so-called beehive huts,
by layers of stones, which, as they rose, gradually approached
each other, the highest supporting a flat slab whose weight
kept them in place, while the pressure of the superincumbent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
cairn or barrow gave solidity to the whole.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> But although
the dolmens which are generally so called may be older
than the chambered barrows,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> they also were almost always
covered or at least fenced by earthen mounds or cairns,
which, in many cases, were still visible little more than a
century ago.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> There is no reason to suppose that in this
country or in Ireland they were built by tribes of a different
stock: it is impossible to draw a sharp distinction between
the two classes of graves;<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> and for our present purpose
they may safely be grouped together. They abound in
Syria and Northern Africa, along the western side of the
Spanish peninsula, over nearly the whole area of France,
in Northern Germany, Wales<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> and the west of England,
Ireland, South-Western and Northern Scotland, Denmark,
and Scandinavia. Some archaeologists conclude that a
dolmen-building race gradually moved westward from Syria,
crossed the Straits of Gibraltar, and thence passed through
Spain and Gaul into Britain; while others insist that the
place of their departure was Scandinavia. But it is not
improbable that dolmens, which exist also in India, Japan,
and many other countries, and which might have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
built all over the world if stones had been everywhere
available for their construction, were not originally designed
by any one people, and that the resemblances which have
been pointed out between those of widely separated regions
were simply due to the similarity with which different
tribes acted in similar circumstances. The neolithic skulls
and the neolithic sepulchral pottery of Scandinavia are
unlike those of Britain; while, on the other hand, the British
dolmens belong to an earlier stage of culture than those
of Africa. Everything points to the conclusion that the
earliest dolmen-builders of Britain retreated from Gaul
before the sturdy round-headed invaders;<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> and it is useless
to inquire whether the Mediterranean stock, to which the
British, like the earlier French dolmen-builders, belonged,
originated in Europe, in Asia, or in Africa. We only
know that the oldest traces of the race were discovered in
the Riviera.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> Some philologists, however, affirm that the
modern Celtic dialects are distinguished by peculiarities of
syntax which show that they were influenced by contact with
an older language akin to the Hamitic dialects of Africa.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg67" class="sidenote">Relics of
the neolithic
population:
their settlements.</div>

<p>Relics of the neolithic population have been found over
the whole extent of Great Britain and in the adjacent
islands, from Kent to Cornwall, from the Isle of Wight to
Shetland, not only in barrows and cairns, but also in caves
in which they lived and died, in the neighbourhood of the
quarries from which they obtained flint for manufacturing
their tools, in pit-dwellings, on the margins of lakes, in the
beds of rivers, in ditches, in peat-mosses, in sandy wastes
where the sand had been blown away from the soil which
it had long concealed, in fens, on open downs, and in fields
by the accidental impact of a plough. Their sepulchres,
as we shall afterwards see,<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> remain in comparatively few
regions; but on the more cultivated lands many have
doubtless been destroyed. It is reasonable to suppose that
the settlements were made successively throughout a long
period; and that the earliest comers took possession of the
choicest lands in the south. Those who came later would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
displace their predecessors if they had the power, and if
the prize seemed worth a struggle: otherwise they would
move on to the nearest vacant lands; and so in the course
of ages, and after much bloodshed, the whole island came
to be occupied. But each successive horde found large
tracts of the country through which they plodded overgrown
by forests or covered by morasses; and they must often have
had to travel far before they could obtain a suitable abode.
Except the gigantic Irish elk and the wild ox known as the
aurochs, which survived into the Bronze Age, and which,
later still, Caesar found roaming in the German forests,<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a>
the great beasts which had lived in Britain with palaeolithic
man were no more; but brown bears and grizzly bears, beavers
and wild cats, still survived; herons, swans, and cormorants
flitted over the fens; red deer, wild boars, and even a few
reindeer remained to supply the new comers with game;
and in every forest wolves were lurking to prey upon their
cattle.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> If we were to mark upon a map all the places
at which neolithic implements have been found, it would
correspond more or less closely with one constructed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>
by a geographer, ignorant of the results of archaeological
research, who appreciated the requirements of early settlers.
He would expect to find that they had avoided as far as
possible the toil of cutting down woods, and that they had
selected dry uplands, where the subsoil was porous and
their cattle could find pasture, and which overlooked river-valleys,
where they themselves could get water and fuel,
and on the slopes of which they could build sheltered
dwellings. He would not therefore be surprised to learn
that the traces of occupation are most numerous on the
chalk downs, the Derbyshire moorlands, the Pennine Range
and the Yorkshire Wolds, the Malvern Hills, and other high
lands which fulfilled the necessary conditions.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>Without his tools the settler could not build his hut,
cut his firewood, or kill and dress a calf or a kid from his
herd. Let us therefore try to ascertain how he made
them, and how far he had improved as a craftsman upon
the rude methods of his palaeolithic predecessor.</p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg69" class="sidenote">Flint
mines and
implement
factories.</div>

<p>Within the last half-century archaeologists have succeeded
in revealing some of the factories in which the prehistoric
cutlers wrought. The nature of their materials of course
still depended upon the rocks which were to be found in
the district where they lived. Those who could get no
flint used quartzite, basalt, felstone, greenstone, porphyry,
diorite, or whatever stone they could obtain.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> But flint
was still the staple material. The palaeolithic hunters
were obliged, as we have seen, to use stray blocks: their
successors had learned how to win the flint from the bed
of chalk in which it lay. Among the chief centres of mining
and manufacture were Brandon in Suffolk and Cissbury,
which is on the South Downs, about three miles north of
Worthing. Grime’s Graves, the mines which supplied the
famous factory of Brandon, are situated in a fern-clad
wood, and occupy more than twenty acres. The so-called
graves are circular shafts, about twenty-five feet in diameter
at the mouth, from thirty to fifty deep, and on an average
twenty-five feet apart. Most of them were connected
by galleries, which had been tunnelled in directions that
followed the seams of the flint. The tools with which the
excavations were made were stone ‘celts’, or hatchets,
and picks made of the brow-tines of the antlers of reindeer.
Unlike modern picks they were one-sided; and a specimen
encrusted with chalk on which the owner’s finger-prints
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
are still visible, is now lying in the Prehistoric Room of the
British Museum. More than one of the lamps were found
by the aid of which the workmen had groped their way
through the galleries,&mdash;small cups hollowed out of chalk,
which they had evidently filled with oil or fat and furnished
with some kind of wick.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> When the flint had been hewn
out with the hatchets, which have left their marks upon
the sides of the galleries, it was hauled up to the surface,
perhaps in baskets made of wicker or hide, and carried to
the workshops, where it was wrought into implements,
which were afterwards bartered for such articles as the manufacturers
required. Innumerable flakes and chips of waste
flint were found, which testified to their activity. One of
them at least was a sculptor as well. A fragment of a human
limb, modelled out of chalk, was discovered by the antiquary
who first explored the site; and he tells us that the anatomical
features were ‘rendered with an accurate knowledge of
the parts’.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> But what most impressed him was to find in
one of the galleries a set of tools lying upon a piece of unfinished
work in the position in which they had been laid
some four thousand years ago.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> Walking through the wood
to the open heath of Broomhill, he came to the pits that
yield the material which the ‘knappers’ of Brandon still
manufacture into gun-flints for African tribes. The industry
has been carried on since neolithic times, and even then it
was ancient; for Brandon was an abode of flint-workers in
the Old Stone Age. Not only the pits but even the tools
show little change: the picks which the modern workers use
are made of iron, but here alone in Britain the old one-sided
form is still retained. Only the skill of the workers has
degenerated: the exquisite evenness of chipping which
distinguished the neolithic arrow-heads is beyond the
power of the most experienced knapper to reproduce.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>The flint works at Cissbury have a general resemblance
to those of Grime’s Graves; but the pits were sunk on a
different principle.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> They are contained in an entrenchment
which did not exist at the time when the earliest were
made, but was almost certainly constructed in the Neolithic
Age.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> The extreme rudeness of the tools which were found
in them has led to the belief that they are older than Grime’s
Graves;<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> but, on the other hand, stone implements of the
rudest kind were manufactured for special purposes long
after the Stone Age had passed away.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> Moreover, many
of the ruder Cissbury tools appear to be unfinished; and
it may have been intended that they should be perfected
by the people with whom they were exchanged. Many of
the smaller pits contained not only stone implements but
also fragments of pottery and remains of horses, goats,
deer, and horned cattle; and from this Pitt-Rivers, who
first explored them, concluded that they had been used as
dwellings after they had ceased to serve their purpose as
quarries, or had been inhabited by the workers who obtained
their flint from the larger pits. On this site also deer-horn
picks were found; and Pitt-Rivers, wishing to test their
value, provided a set of similar tools, with which he and one
of the labourers whom he employed dug a pit three feet
square and three feet deep in an hour and a half.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></p>

<p>With the better material which was thus obtained the
neolithic craftsmen fashioned implements of which some
can hardly be distinguished, even by experts, from those of
the older period, though the greater number are recognizable
even by a tiro. It must, however, be remembered that in
many cases one cannot tell whether a find of stone implements
belongs to the Neolithic or to the Bronze Age; and
some are probably later still. Indeed it would be impossible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
to point to any kind of stone implements which ceased to be
manufactured in Britain when bronze was introduced.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a>
<span id="PI_CIII_Pg72" class="sidenote">Indefiniteness of the prehistoric ‘Ages’.</span> One of the first cautions which the student of archaeology
gives himself is that the epochs into which it has been found

separated. It has been well said that they shade
into one another like the colours in the solar spectrum.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> The
age in which we are now living affords an illustration. In
one sense what might be called the Mechanical Age began
when the first motor-car appeared on a London street;
but we are still living in an era of transition, which will
not end until, if ever, horses shall have ceased to be used
for traction. Similarly stone tools continued to be used
throughout the Bronze Age and the Late Celtic Period;
and in certain remoter parts of the British Isles they are
being used to-day.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> When they are found associated with
primary interments in long barrows or chambered cairns,
or when they are met with in large numbers in other deposits
which there is no reason to assign to a later period, they
may as a rule be safely referred to the Neolithic Age; but,
as we shall presently see,<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> there are certain implements
of stone which were undoubtedly used in the Bronze Age,
and of which it cannot be said with certainty that in this
country they were used before. Some interments, however,
which are ascribed to the Age of Bronze may have belonged
to the older race, who still remained in their neolithic age
although they were glad to use any bronze tools upon which
they could lay their hands. Similarly the grave of an
Australian savage who was buried some sixty years ago
was found to contain, besides a piece of flint, a clay pipe,
an iron spoon, and the handle of a pocket-knife.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a>

<p>The several kinds of tools that first began to be used in
the Neolithic Age present numerous varieties of form which,
in this book, it would be irrelevant to describe. To deal
with them is the province of archaeology; and the reader
who wishes to make himself acquainted with them can do
so, after he has mastered the literature of the subject,
by visiting the collections in our museums and by himself
becoming a collector. Here we desire only to learn so much
as may help us to understand how neolithic man lived,
and from what origins the culture which succeeded his
was evolved.</p>

<p>The Neolithic Age is sometimes, especially on the other
side of the Channel, called the period of polished stone:<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>
but most of our flint implements were neither ground nor
polished; they were merely chipped. Many specimens
indeed, from one cause or another, have never received
their finishing touches; but many others were of such
a kind that grinding or polishing would have been labour
lost.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg73b" class="sidenote">The two
main divisions
of flint implements.</div>

<p>Neolithic flint implements may be grouped in two classes.
In one, which comprises the larger kinds&mdash;axes, hammer-stones,
and the like&mdash;the implement was made out of a block
of flint, and the splinters struck off during the process of
manufacture were either mere waste or utilized for making
smaller tools.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> The other class consists of tools which were
made out of flakes, the core, after all the required flakes had
been detached, being thrown away.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg73c" class="sidenote">How flint
implements
were made.</div>

<p>Flint fresh from the quarry was easier to manufacture;
and accordingly the cutlers established their workshops
close by the mines. Their methods were perhaps not
everywhere the same; but it is easy to form a general idea
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
of them from observing the processes which are followed
by tribes which are still in their stone age and by the knappers
who ply their trade near Grime’s Graves. Sometimes, like
the Cloud River Indians, the workers may have applied
a pebble or a punch of deer-horn to the surface of the flint
block, and produced flakes by striking it with his stone
hammer; but Sir John Evans believes that the flakes were
generally struck off with a hammer or a pebble alone; and he
has found experimentally that by this simple method a practised
hand can attain almost perfect precision. Laying the
flakes which he had thus removed with the flat face uppermost
upon a smooth block of stone, he has succeeded by
blows of a pebble in chipping their ends into whatever
form he desired. Similarly hatchets were first rough-hewn
by striking splinters from the flint block, and afterwards
gradually chipped into the proper shape. Whether the
material was flint or some other stone, the method would
have remained the same. When it was desired to attain
the utmost perfection, the implements were ground, not
upon a revolving but upon a fixed stone, and polished by
stone rubbers in conjunction with sand.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> The process by
which the arrow-heads and spear-heads were manufactured,
whose exquisite workmanship entrances all who see them,
cannot be described; for the modern tribes who make such
weapons work in various ways. Small stone tools, however,
are often found, with blunted ends, made out of thick flakes,
which may have been used in arrow-flaking, and which
accordingly have been termed ‘fabricators’; and as they
are most numerous in the districts which have yielded
the greatest number of arrow-heads, the appellation is
probably correct. Arrow-heads have indeed been recently
made with them, but with somewhat obtuse edges; and it
has therefore been suggested that the fabricator was only
used for removing irregularities from the flake, and that the
final chipping was accomplished with a tool of deer-horn,
which, pressed deftly against the edge of the flake, detached
minute splinters. The surface of many flint arrow-heads
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
and javelin-heads is, however, covered with beautifully
uniform fluting, like ripple-marks on sand; and the most
experienced modern operators confess that they do not
understand how this effect was produced.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg75" class="sidenote">Celts</div>

<p>It may be well to enumerate the various tools which
would have formed a complete outfit for a neolithic household.
The kinds which were made from a block of stone
were celts, which comprised hatchets and adzes, and of
which some may have been used as chisels and knives;
axes perforated for the insertion of a handle; chisels and
gouges; hammer-stones, pestles, and whetstones. Most
readers are familiar with the term ‘celt’; but not every
one is aware that it has no connexion with the name of the
people who were the latest prehistoric invaders of these
islands, and is simply an Anglicized form of a Latin word,
meaning a chisel, which does not occur except in the Vulgate.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
Some celts were ground or polished only on the edge; some
over their whole surface; and a few are so exquisitely finished
on both sides that the labour which was devoted to them
would have seemed excessive unless it had been a labour
of love.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> On the other hand, many were neither ground nor
polished; and some of the ruder ones may have been used
as agricultural implements.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> Several
have been found with pointed butts
and extremely elongated oval sections,
which have the closest resemblance
to celts from the West
Indies, and illustrate the truth of
the observation that identity in
form of implements, weapons, and
other objects belonging to widely
separated lands does not necessarily
prove community of origin,
but as a rule merely shows that
similar wants in similar circumstances
produce similar results.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a>
Although those celts which were
used as hatchets or adzes were
evidently mounted, there are some
that show grooves on both sides or
notches on one side, which seem
to have been intended to enable
them to be easily grasped.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> Most
of the handles, having been made
of wood, have naturally perished;
but two hatchets, now in the British
Museum, have been found with their handles complete,&mdash;one
in Solway Moss by a man digging peat for fuel,<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> the other in
the bed of a Cumbrian lake called Ehenside Tarn.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> Unlike
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
the Swiss lake-dwellers, who had learned to fix their blades
in deer-horn sockets, which were sufficiently elastic to
prevent the wooden hafts from being injured by concussion,<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a>
the makers of these hatchets had simply mounted them in
a hole which fitted the butt, but which, by the jar of repeated
blows, must soon have become split.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<p>Like the stone hatchets of the Maoris, neolithic celts were
doubtless used not only for felling
trees,<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> chopping firewood, and
slaughtering cattle, but also as
battle-axes; and the profusion in
which the ruder kinds have been
found at Cissbury and Grime’s
Graves shows that they also served
as miners’ tools.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg77b" class="sidenote">Chisels
and
gouges.</div>

<p>Among the chisels some of the
most interesting are small specimens,
which came from Suffolk
and the Yorkshire Wolds, and
which may have been designed for
wood-carving, and one from the
Fen country, the end of which is
described as exactly like that of a
narrow ‘cold chisel’ of steel, used
by engineers.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> Gouges, which are
abundant in Denmark and Sweden,
are very rare in this country. It
has been suggested that canoes,
for making which they were perhaps
chiefly used, were more necessary in Scandinavia than in
Britain; and it is significant that the best British gouges all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
come from the fens, where canoes must have been needed
for crossing the floods.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> It is probable, however, that
although gouges may have been used in finishing the
vessels, the heavy work of hollowing the trees out of which
they were formed was
largely performed by
the agency of fire, as
among the North
American Indians of
comparatively recent
times.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></p>

anvils, and

<p>No stone implements
are more familiar to students of
antiquities than the
axes, axe-hammers,
and hammers, in
which, as in those
of our own day, holes
were drilled for the
insertion of handles.
Many of them were
probably used as weapons
of war. Some
of the axes are double-edged,
though the
edge is often blunted,
as though it had been
intended rather for
striking than for cutting;
while the axe-hammers
resemble an
ordinary hammer at
one end, and are sharpened at the other.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> It would perhaps
be impossible to prove that any of these tools were used
in Southern Britain in the Neolithic Age, although they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
were not uncommon on the Continent;<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> and most of those
which are to be seen in our museums undoubtedly belong
to the time when bronze was common:<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> but some few have

may have served as anvils or mortars; and others
again&mdash;quartzite pebbles or flint cores, which were found
at Cissbury, Grime’s Graves, and other
places&mdash;were apparently used for chipping
flints. Some nearly globular stones, whose
battered surfaces testify to hard wear, were
doubtless for triturating grain or edible roots.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg79" class="sidenote">Implements
made by
flakes.</div>

<p>The varieties of tools which have been made
out of flakes are too numerous to particularize.
Simple flakes, flat or triangular
in section, varying in length from nine or
ten inches to one inch, are the most abundant
of all stone implements, and are to be found
in every quarter of the globe. Here they are
generally made of flint and are rarely ground.
Some of them may have been used as surgical
instruments; for, as we shall presently see,
trepanning of the human skull was practised
in the Neolithic Age.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> Others were made
into saws, the teeth of which are occasionally
so fine that to the unaided eye they are
hardly visible.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> Many, shaped like horse-shoes,
ducks’ bills, oyster-shells, or short spoons, or nearly
round, were used for dressing hides, for scraping haematitic
iron ore in order to obtain the red pigment which served
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
primitive man as rouge,<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> and perhaps, in conjunction
with nodules of iron pyrites, for producing fire.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> Some
were fashioned into awls and drills;<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> others into knives,
daggers, and curved blades, which may perhaps have
<span id="PI_CIII_Pg80" class="sidenote">Javelin-heads and arrow-heads.</span>
been sickles.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> But the most beautiful
weapons made out of flakes were
javelin-heads and arrow-heads, which
in this country are almost always of
flint. If British neolithic workmanship
did not on the whole reach the level of
that of Denmark, in fashioning missile
weapons our armourers could hold their
own. Whether any given specimen
was an arrow-head or a javelin-head,
a javelin-head or a spear-head, can
generally be decided only by size. Many
are so small that no one can mistake
the purpose for which they were intended;
but it is not certain whether
the largest were attached to spear-shafts,
properly so called, or served as
javelins. Arrow-heads and javelin-heads
may be grouped in four classes,
each of which has several varieties,&mdash;leaf-shaped,
lozenge-shaped, stemmed,
and triangular; but some five or
six arrow-heads have been picked up
whose outline was characterized by
ogee curves. The stemmed heads are generally, and
the triangular, which are rare, occasionally barbed.
Although the various kinds were used contemporaneously,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
barbs were perhaps of comparatively late invention,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a>
and may have been evolved in the struggle for existence
as the population became more dense.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> Not a single
barbed arrow-head or javelin-head has ever been found
in a long barrow;<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> but they occur in the chambered
cairns of Scotland, as well as in certain English round
barrows which were erected towards the end of the
Neolithic Age;<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> and a fine specimen was associated
with many beautifully finished implements in a neolithic
village at West Wickham.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> A leaf-shaped arrow-head was
found in a peat-moss at Fyvie, in Aberdeenshire, still fixed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
in a cleft in its shaft; but the cord or sinew by which it
had doubtless been secured had disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> Arrow-heads
may also have been made of hardened wood or bone, which
holds poison better than flint.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg82a" class="sidenote">Bone
implements.</div>

<p>The archers of many countries use wrist-guards to protect
their arms against the recoil of the bowstring; and for this
purpose the prehistoric Britons made rectangular plates
of stone or bone, curved to fit their wrists and perforated
near the angles with holes to enable them to be fastened.
Most of those which have been collected belonged to the
Bronze Age; but they probably came into use before.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a>
Various other implements of bone&mdash;awls, needles, chisels,
and perhaps daggers and lance-heads&mdash;were also common
in the Neolithic Age;<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> and it is worth noticing that a well-known
collector has found palaeolithic tools which, as his
practised eye discerned, had been picked up and reflaked
by neolithic men.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg82b" class="sidenote">Pygmy
flints.</div>

<p>Of all stone implements the most curious are the tiny
objects which are known as ‘pygmy flints’, and which have
been found not only in certain parts of Britain<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> and
Ireland,<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> but also in France, Belgium, Spain, North Africa
and Egypt, Palestine and India. They are all made of
minute flakes; and in one of our collections the marks
of working could not be detected without the aid of a microscope,
while sixty-four specimens, many of which were no
more than a quarter of an inch long, weighed less than half
an ounce. Numerous guesses, which need not be repeated,
have been made as to their use. Everywhere their forms
are identical; and, partly for this reason, partly because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
in many places no other implements were associated with
them, it has been supposed by lovers of the marvellous
that they were the work of a peculiar race.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> If the latter
reason were valid, we should be compelled to assume that
the Lilliputians had sent out many colonies from the land
where Gulliver found them. But every archaeologist
knows that tools and other articles of identical form are to
be found in divers continents; and pygmy flints may often
have lain with others and have escaped observation.</p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg83a" class="sidenote">Specialization
of industries.</div>

<p>A survey of the implements and other relics arranged in a
representative collection teaches us that men had already
learned the necessity of a division of labour. Some clans
who used flint implements could only have obtained them
by barter. Even in the great factories of Grime’s Graves
and Cissbury the miners were evidently distinct from the
cutlers, as were both from the herdsmen. But in other
settlements, where mining and cutlery were apparently not
predominant industries, implements have been found of
such perfect finish that their manufacture would seem to
have been the special or the sole occupation of skilled
members of the community.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg83b" class="sidenote">A lost art.</div>

<p>But there was one thing which the forerunner of neolithic
man had done, and which he could not do. Among his relics
we may look in vain for the carved dagger-handles, the
engraved antlers, and the other works of art of the palaeolithic
caves. Except in Grime’s Graves, not a single attempt
to portray the human figure, or animal, or plant has ever
been found among the deposits of the Neolithic Age. If
the artists of Derbyshire and Aquitaine had left descendants,
perhaps they were massacred or enslaved, perhaps their
individuality withered under oppression: whatever may
have been the cause, the old creative art was dead.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg84" class="sidenote">Dwellings.</div>

<p>Provided with their tools, the neolithic herdsmen were
able to construct dwellings which, humble as they were,
must have been comfortable in comparison with the shelters
that had satisfied the hunters of the older time. Unfortunately,
however, the evidence relating to the domestic
life of the neolithic people is far less complete than that
which has been preserved in regard to their Swiss contemporaries.
In that age and for many centuries after it
had come to an end the inhabitants of northern and western
Europe, like the ancient Romans whom Horace<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> eulogized,
were content to live in habitations which were small and
mean, while, under the influence of superstitious terror
as much as of reverence, they constructed the mansions
of their dead chieftains on a magnificent scale. Thus,
while neolithic sepulchres are still conspicuous upon the
western hills, few buildings have left traces which can be
referred with absolute certainty to the same period.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> Many
of the ‘hut-circles’ and pit-dwellings which have been
excavated contain no trace of metal; but it is generally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
impossible, in any given instance, to dismiss all doubts as
to their antiquity when we find others, precisely similar,
which were certainly occupied, if not built, by people who
used implements of bronze. Still it is not credible that
such dwellings were constructed for the first time after
the introduction of metal working; and it is reasonable
to believe that they were common before the earliest bronze
implement was imported into Britain. Indeed a pit-dwelling
has been found at the eastern end of a long barrow near the
village of Hanging Grimston on the Yorkshire Wolds; and,
as it was proved by excavation to be older than the barrow,<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a>
it must have been dug in the Neolithic Age. There were
of course villages of some sort at Cissbury and Grime’s
Graves; and at Grovehurst, near Sittingbourne, are the
remains of huts which were occupied by implement-makers.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a>
A group of pits on the sheltered southern slope of Croham
Hurst, about a mile south of Croydon, the fields near which
are thickly strewn with flint flakes, probably formed the
winter abode of a small community:<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> on Hayes Common
a village has been explored, comprising about one hundred
and sixty pits, the period of which was determined by the
discovery of a neolithic workshop, on the floor of a pit of
identical form, at Millfield in the immediate neighbourhood;
and the neolithic age of a settlement at West Wickham
was as clearly proved by the nature of the implements.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a>
At these places, at Weybourne in Norfolk, on the Hampshire
Downs, and elsewhere, the sites of such dwellings are indicated
by circular depressions, ranging in diameter from
six to thirty feet and from two to six feet deep, which,
though they generally occur in groups, are sometimes
isolated. Each is surrounded by a bank, formed of the
excavated earth, in which the entrance is marked by a gap.
The bank was in certain cases prevented from falling in by
a stone circle; and upon it was reared a hut, sometimes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
perhaps formed of stones, but more often of interlaced
boughs, while the roof, in which a hole was left for the
escape of smoke, was probably thatched with fern or heather
or turf, and, if it happened to be large, supported by a pole
or the trunk of a tree, the position of which seems to be
indicated by a mound in the centre of the pit.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> A cluster
of huts was apparently sometimes surrounded by an entrenchment,
which protected the inhabitants and their cattle from
night attacks.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> Rude as these structures were, they fulfilled
their purpose. The soil on which they were built
was generally dry: the pit not only ensured warmth but
also enabled the roof to be carried to a sufficient height:
the bank, by throwing off the rain, kept the interior dry;
and while in certain cases the remains of a hearth made of
flints are found in the centre, in others it would seem that
cooking was performed outside. Thus one group of pits
on Hayes Common, the dimensions of which are within the
ordinary range, is associated with smaller depressions, which
apparently contained cooking-hearths.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> A small fire might
have been safely lighted inside the hut to warm the inmates;
but a large one, such as would have been necessary for cooking
a joint or an entire hare or sucking-pig, might have
ignited the inflammable roof.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></p>

<p>A remarkable group of pits has recently been excavated
in Wigtownshire.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> Piles had been driven into them to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
support a wooden floor, the object of which was doubtless
to keep them dry; and the marks on the piles seemed to
their discoverer to show that they had been cut with stone
hatchets.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></p>

<p>Three entirely subterranean chambers, of a kind which
has been met with nowhere else in the British Isles, have
lately been discovered by navvies who were digging a
sewer-trench at Waddon, near Croydon. They were about
twelve feet in diameter and seven feet high; and although
they contained fragments of Romano-British pottery, the
flint flakes and blocks which lay upon the floors were assigned
by the experienced antiquary who explored them<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a>
to the Age of Stone. While he was impressed by their
exact resemblance to certain Portuguese neolithic chambers
which were used for burial,<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> he suggested that they might
also have served as shelters in times of excessive heat or
cold.</p>

<p>Unlike their Swiss contemporaries, who built their huts
on platforms, supported by piles driven into the beds of
lakes, the neolithic Britons lived mainly if not exclusively
on land. Lake-dwellings indeed abound in the British
Isles; but exploration shows that almost all were erected
in the Late Celtic Period; and the only one in Britain which
can with any show of reason be referred to the Age of Stone
is in Holderness, which, before it was drained, was covered
with marshes and shallow meres. One of a group of five,
called the West Furze dwelling, contained a large number
of flint flakes: but a bronze spear-head was also found
in it; and the evidence is not sufficient to show that it was
built in a pre-metallic period.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg88" class="sidenote">Food and
cookery.</div>

<p>The food of the neolithic population has left more abundant
traces than their homes. The bones which are strewed
in their sepulchres and settlements show that they lived in
great part on venison and the flesh of the wild boar;<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> and
the skull of an aurochs, which was found in the Fen country
with a stone weapon sticking in it,<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> proves that they also
followed the largest game. Unlike the palaeolithic hunters,
they used dogs in the chase; and it has been plausibly
conjectured that these animals were the first to be domesticated.
For man was a hunter before he was a herdsman;
and the dog would soon begin to lick the hand that rewarded
it with a share of the slaughtered boar or deer.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> It would
seem, however, that when with advancing age dogs had
become too slow for hunting, they were killed and eaten;
for canine bones, apparently of old animals, were found at
Grime’s Graves.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> Neolithic immigrants introduced sheep,<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a>
goats, and pigs as well as horned cattle; and all the bones
of the latter which have been collected from their refuse-heaps
and graves were those of small oxen, the scientific
name of which&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bos longifrons</i>&mdash;is familiar to all students
of antiquities, and which resembled their living descendants,
the Kerry cattle of Ireland and the small black animals of
the Welsh mountains. Some authorities believe that these
and all our varieties of domestic oxen are descended from
the aurochs, which, as we have seen, was living in this country
in palaeolithic times, and suggest that its calves were trapped
and tamed;<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> while others maintain that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bos longifrons</i> was
introduced by neolithic immigrants. The extreme smallness
of the prehistoric domestic oxen is as easily accounted
for as that of the mountain cattle of the present day. The
tribes who kept them had but limited pasturage: forage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
in winter was probably scanty; and the milk which was
needed by their calves was largely consumed by their owners.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a>
The broken bones of cattle which were found at Grime’s
Graves belonged to very young animals, which the implement-makers
who bred them evidently could not afford to
rear.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> The meat was boiled in rude hand-made vessels of
earthenware heated by red-hot flints, or, as we may infer
from the frequent occurrence in barrows of charred bones,
roasted or broiled over the fire; and the remains of each
meal were left to accumulate in the huts.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> It has been
suggested by one of the most eminent of living anthropologists
that the ornament, so often observed on prehistoric
earthenware, which was produced by impressing a cord
upon the clay while it was soft, may be traceable to an earlier
time when the art of the potter had not been evolved, and
vessels were made of plaited cords and also perhaps of skins
and hollowed wood.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg89" class="sidenote">Agriculture.</div>

<p>Although agriculture was practised by the later neolithic
inhabitants of Denmark<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> and the lake-dwellers of Switzerland,<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a>
there is very little evidence that their contemporaries
in this country tilled the soil. A few of the stone pestles
which have been found belong, it is true, to that period,<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a>
but it is impossible, except perhaps in a very few instances,
to affirm that they were used for grinding corn;<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> and
although, as we have seen, certain rough-hewn celts may
have been agricultural implements,<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> it is doubtful whether
they all belong to the Age of Stone. Cereals and textile
flax-fabrics, which are abundant in the lake-dwellings, are

absolutely wanting in every British neolithic deposit that
has been explored.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> Negative evidence of this kind may
not be worth much: nevertheless there is reason to believe
that agriculture was rare in Britain before the introduction
of bronze. Barrow-diggers have often noticed that the
teeth of neolithic skeletons are, as a rule, remarkably
perfect; while those of the skulls found in round barrows
and unchambered cairns are very much worn down; and
it has been reasonably argued that the difference was due
to food. The people of the Bronze Age, who were undoubtedly
cultivators, subsisted in great part upon grain, which was
probably ill cooked, and must have been largely mixed
with stony grit from contact with the rude mullers by which
it had been ground. The neolithic people, on the other
hand, lived mainly upon milk and flesh-meat.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> Pastoral
tribes do not turn to agriculture until their numbers have
increased to such a degree that they have no prospect of
being able to live by hunting and on the produce of their
flocks and herds alone: they prefer an easy life; and
agriculture, especially to those whose implements are primitive,
is difficult and laborious.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> If corn was grown, it was
probably on the open chalk downs.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> The richer soils were
covered with forest; and, although the stone axe was a
better tool than any which the primitive hunters had
possessed, the neolithic herdsman must have shrunk from
the labour of cutting down the trees and dragging them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
away. Fire would have been of no avail. Men who have
cleared forests in New Zealand will tell you that the fiercest
flames will not destroy standing trees: twigs and leaves
burn like tinder; but the trunk remains unconsumed.</p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg91a" class="sidenote">Treatment
of women.</div>

<p>There is evidence, though it is hardly needed, that the
inevitable hardships of life were not equally shared, and
that the lot of the women was worse than that of the men.
Judging from the measurements of the neolithic skeletons,
the disparity between the sexes in stature was as great as
it is among modern savage tribes. The average height
of the men was about five feet six inches, of the women
only four feet ten inches: the difference in civilized communities
is about half as much.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> It is perhaps safe to conclude
that when food was scarce, the men thought first
of themselves, and that the women not only suffered from
the effects of early child-bearing,<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> but had more than their
<span id="PI_CIII_Pg91b" class="sidenote">Duration of life.</span>
share of toil. No doubt disease, the attacks of wild beasts,
and frequent accidents, as well as intertribal wars, tended
to shorten the duration of life: at all events Thurnam
calculated that the average age of the people whose skeletons
he had examined was not more than forty-five years.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg91c" class="sidenote">Clothing
and ornaments.</div>

<p>The sheep and goats and the wild red deer which supplied
the tribes with food doubtless clothed them as well; and
it may be questioned whether in this respect they had
advanced much beyond the primitive denizens of caves.
The lake-dwellers of Switzerland were expert spinners:
the textile fabrics which lay unnoticed for millenniums
in their settlements show what they could achieve.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> Our
own forefathers may have been as skilful: but evidence
is lacking; and their pottery was so inferior to that of the
Helvetians, they lagged so far behind them as tool-makers,
that we may reasonably assume that their women also were
less proficient in domestic arts.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> The perforated disks of
stone and baked clay, called spindle-whorls, by which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
spindle was made to rotate, have indeed been found in great
numbers here; but not a single specimen can be assigned
with confidence to the Neolithic Age.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> British ornaments
too of that period are very rare.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> No doubt the Britons
were as fond of display as other barbarians: there is, as
we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> some evidence that they decorated their
bodies with red paint; but a few lignite beads, found in
the long horned cairn of Yarhouse,<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> and a single bead of
shale, found in a long barrow in Gloucestershire,<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> are all
the personal ornaments that we can unhesitatingly refer to
the Age of Stone. An ingenious archaeologist, who perhaps
knows less of human nature than of books and museums,
has argued that the origin of jewellery was rooted in superstition;<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a>
and those who know that natural holed stones
are still prized as amulets in the more primitive villages
of this country<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> may easily persuade themselves that savage
men and women had faith in the prophylactic properties
of the perforated teeth and beads which they hung round
their necks: but nobody who can understand the passion
for sparkling gems which possesses many women and some
men will believe that the love of adornment for its own
sake was not as deep-seated in primitive human nature as
superstition.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg92" class="sidenote">Trepanning.</div>

<p>But amulets of a different kind, which are abundant in
other lands, appear to be almost entirely wanting in our
own. It is not difficult to understand that in material
culture the prehistoric inhabitants of Britain should have
been outstripped by those of the Continent; but it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
remarkable that a practice, the motive of which was mainly
superstitious, and which was prevalent not only in every
European country but also in America, has in this island
apparently left but one vestige, which belonged to the
Late Celtic Period. Sixty trepanned skulls were found in
the cavern of Baumes-Chaudes in the department of Lozère;
and twenty years ago a French physician had collected
one hundred and sixty-seven. The operation was evidently
performed either by scraping the skull with a stone
implement or with a stone saw;<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> for an eminent surgeon
has remarked that saw-cuts are distinctly visible on some
of the French trepanned skulls. In a few cases the object
was to remove dead bone; but as most of the skulls show
no trace of disease, it has been conjectured that the patients
were afflicted with epilepsy, and that the operator’s aim
was to relieve them by permitting the escape of the demon
who was believed to be the author of their sufferings. It
is, however, certain that the skull of a corpse was sometimes
trepanned; and the edge of the perforation in specimens
of this class generally shows signs of an old cicatrization.
The explanation may easily be found. Some of the
fragments which had been removed from trepanned skulls
were evidently used as amulets, for they are carefully
rounded, polished, and perforated for suspension; and one
was actually found hanging from a Gallic torque, or gold
collar, of the Early Iron Age. Most probably, as the
famous anthropologist, Paul Broca, concluded, these amulets
were taken posthumously from the skulls of persons
who had survived the operation, being regarded as potent
prophylactics.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg94" class="sidenote">The
<i>couvade</i>.</div>

<p>Folk-lore societies have collected countless instances of
beliefs or customs preserved by the lower classes of modern
nations, many of which are certainly of very remote origin,
although it is generally impossible to say where they originated,
or whether they belonged to this or that people of
antiquity. But there is evidence that one custom which
appears utterly meaningless to those who have not inquired
its original meaning, which is retained by peoples who
have long forgotten what that meaning was, but which
with others is still or was in comparatively recent times
not merely a survival but a reality, existed among our
neolithic ancestors. Every one has heard of the <i>couvade</i>,
or hatching, which ordains that when a child is born the
father should take to his bed, and there remain for days
or weeks after the mother has resumed her ordinary mode
of life. We learn from Greek writers that it prevailed
among the ancient Corsicans,<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> the Tibareni of Pontus in
Asia Minor,<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> and the Iberians of Northern Spain;<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> and
with various modifications it exists or has existed among
the Basques and the Caribs of the West Indies, in South
America, California, Greenland, West Africa, Southern
India, the Indian archipelago, and Eastern Asia. It
originated in a belief that the real parent was the father,
and that between him and his child there was a physical
union so intimate that unless he rested and were nursed
and abstained from ordinary food, his child would suffer.
But this belief was not primitive. Matriarchy, it would
seem, was the root of family life: descent was reckoned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
through the mother, for the father was often unknown.
It has been conjectured that when paternal relationship
began to be acknowledged, fathers felt the need of insisting
upon their rights, and that accordingly a parody of lying-in
gradually became a custom.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> An Irish legend shows that
the <i>couvade</i> survived in Ulster into the Christian era;<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> and
a few years ago a similar custom was observed in a remote
district of Yorkshire.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> Although the peoples who have
retained the <i>couvade</i> in modern times, like those among
whom its existence was noted by ancient writers, are, with
hardly an exception, neither of Aryan nor of Semitic
origin, it is perhaps conceivable that it may have been
brought into the British Isles in post-neolithic times by
invaders who had accepted it from races whom they had
subdued; but it is far more probable that it was a widespread
custom of the Neolithic Age belonging to tribes of
the Mediterranean race, to which the neolithic Britons, as
well as the Iberians and Corsicans, belonged.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg95" class="sidenote">Hill-forts.</div>

<p>Although the neolithic tribes of Britain had common
customs and superstitions,<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> and were, for the most part,
sprung from one stock, they were not of course a nation.
Arriving in successive hordes, and settling wherever they
could find room, they were separated by mountain, stream,
forest, and morass, as well as by the lack of horses, vehicles,
and roads. But as their numbers multiplied and it became
more and more difficult to find sufficient food, the struggle
for life must have led to intertribal war, and men’s minds
must have been exercised to improve their weapons and
to fortify their settlements and cattle-pounds not only
against the wolves, which they had ever with them, but
also against depredation. Every one who knows the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
South Downs and the hilly districts of the midlands, the
west, and the north, has noticed the camps and earthworks
which crown almost every height; but, as we have already
seen, there are only a few of these entrenchments of which
the period of construction is known, although we have
abundant evidence that many have been occupied by
successive races or in successive stages of culture. Almost
all of them have been superficially explored, and implements
of neolithic form have been found in many; but
the reader knows that such implements were used in the
Bronze Age and in the Iron Age even in those parts of the
country where bronze and iron were common. If stone
tools were found in the original body of a rampart or
beneath the silt in a trench, without any objects of metal
or any such tools or pottery as were characteristic of the
Bronze Age or of later times, it might fairly be presumed
that the people who built the camp were in their neolithic
stage.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> Except the camps that are known to be Roman,
and others which have been proved by excavation to be
Norman, most of those that have been thoroughly explored
were evidently constructed after the art of metal-working
had become known; and this is also true of those that
have been scientifically examined in France.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> There are,
however, not a few British strongholds for which neolithic
age has been claimed, though perhaps in some instances
on insufficient grounds. Thus it has been asserted that
Whit Tor camp on Dartmoor has yielded ample evidence of
neolithic origin;<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> but all the excavations of hut-circles,
kistvaens, and barrows that have been made on Dartmoor
tend to show that it was not occupied before the Bronze
Age.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> A few of the pits which abound in the hill-fort of
Eggardun in Dorsetshire have been explored; and it is
said that one of them contained ‘typical neolithic pottery’.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
But, in the absence of an exact description of the vessels,
such an argument is unsatisfactory, although it might have
some weight if they resembled the coarse unornamented
bowls which were found in the long barrow of North Bavant
in Wiltshire<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> or the neolithic bowls of the Scottish chambered
cairns.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> Still there are entrenchments, such as
Chanctonbury Rings,<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> on the downs some six miles north
of Worthing, Beltout,<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> within which stands the Beachy
Head lighthouse, the Maiden Bower camp near Dunstable,<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a>
and some on the Surrey Hills,<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> in and around which flint
implements have been found in such profusion that they
may be provisionally referred to the Neolithic Age.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> Even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
Cissbury camp, which contained numerous relics of the
Early Iron Age, may have been constructed in the age of
stone: a single cutting, only eleven yards long, revealed
numerous worked flints lying, without pottery or metal,
on the chalk bottom; and Pitt-Rivers suggested that the
entrenchment might have been made for the protection
of the mines.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> It is true that no bronze implement was
found, from which it might be argued that the camp was
not constructed before the Iron Age: but, for aught that
we can tell, bronze may still be lying beneath the soil;
for the cost of excavating the whole camp, without which
it is impossible to prove the negative, would be enormous.
Certain small entrenchments in Franche-Comté were unquestionably
constructed in neolithic times;<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> and it may
be safely said that in an age when life and property were
so insecure every isolated settlement must have been in
some way fortified. Many of the entrenchments on the
South Downs are, however, so slight that they could only
have protected flocks and herds against wolves; and this
may also have been the purpose of the thickset hedge,
undoubtedly of prehistoric origin, that marks the line along
which the downs were bounded by the Wealden Forest.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg99" class="sidenote">Primitive
writing.</div>

<p>Although the historian who endeavours to press archaeology
into his service is struck by the general similarity in
material culture between the peoples of different lands,
and is sometimes inclined, overlooking the differences in
detail, to think that in describing one he would be describing
all, he presently remembers that if historical records were
to be destroyed, much the same state of things would
confront the archaeologist of the remote future; and in
his own researches he meets with differences which lead
him to believe that in every land the first beginnings of
a national culture and of a national character were already
being evolved. In this country or in that significant relics
are discovered of which in others there is not a trace. One
of the more sensational discoveries of recent years may set
us wondering whether in prehistoric Britain vestiges of
primitive writing will ever come to light. Many people
have heard vaguely of the painted pebbles and the frescoes
of Mas d’Azil and the other caverns in the Western Pyrenees
which the veteran archaeologist, Edouard Piette, has for
many years diligently searched. On one of the objects
found in the cavern of Lorthet&mdash;a spirited engraving on
reindeer-horn representing reindeer and salmon&mdash;are to be
seen two small lozenges, each enclosing a central line:
‘justly proud of his work,’ says Monsieur Piette, ‘the
artist has appended his signature.’<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> Be this as it may,
other explorers have exhumed from the Placard cave at
Rochebertier and the caves of La Madelaine and Mas
d’Azil antlers incised with signs which exactly resemble
various Greek and Phoenician letters, and may be compared
with signs that have been found in an island of the Pacific.
These signs are not letters but symbols: they are not
combined in such a way as to form words or inscriptions.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a>
But, says Monsieur Piette, being symbols, they do constitute
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
a kind of primitive writing.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> True writing is, however,
evident on a potsherd taken from a neolithic settlement
at Los Murciélagos in Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> If this fragment
could itself be proved to be of neolithic age, it would follow
that in that remote time the art of writing was already
known to at least one branch of the Mediterranean stock.
But not a trace of writing, not even one of the alphabetiform
symbols which were so widespread in the Pyrenees
even in the late Palaeolithic Age, has yet been found in
any prehistoric deposit in this island.</p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg100" class="sidenote">Sepulture:
barrows
and cairns.</div>

<p>So far we have been trying to piece together an account
of the life of neolithic man. But it is of the last scene
of all that the vestiges which he has left behind are most
unmistakable. His sepulchres have been thoroughly and
scientifically explored. Moreover, it is from them that
much of the knowledge which we possess of his daily life
has been gleaned. They afford evidence about his political
and social organization, his religion, and his customs; and
when we have examined them we shall be able to form
a more vivid idea of the way in which he lived.</p>

<p>We have seen that the dead were sometimes buried in
caves wherein they or their forefathers had dwelled;<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> and
the humbler folk who had not the means of erecting
sepulchral monuments must have dug graves of which no
apparent trace remains; but the funerals that have told
their own tale were those of chieftains, their families, and
perhaps their favourite slaves, who were buried beneath
mounds which, in divers forms, are found all over the
world.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> Savage communities indeed are commonly ruled
by councils of elders; but in the period when the neolithic
barrows were being erected the Britons had certainly passed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
beyond this stage. The means by which the revolution
was effected were probably various. If the most adroit
magician in a community of which every member practised
magic may sometimes by force of character have made
himself a chief,<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> it is certain that when property accumulated
and group began to prey upon group, the instinct of
self-preservation must have led men to submit to the rule
of him who was marked out as the fittest to command in
war.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> Those who love to look for the places in this land
that are hallowed by their associations with an older world
may have seen the long barrows which are conspicuous on
the hills that command Salisbury Plain and on other
western heights, the chambered cairns of Scotland, and the
dolmens of Cornwall and Wales. These sepulchres are far
rarer than those of the Bronze Age, not more than sixty
having been counted in Wiltshire, where they are most
numerous, while the round barrows of the same county
number nearly two thousand;<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> and the area of their
distribution is far less extensive. In Gloucestershire,
Somersetshire, and Dorsetshire they are not uncommon;
a few are to be seen in the East Riding of Yorkshire; and
Kent, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Durham, Cumberland, and
Westmorland have each one.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> Chambered cairns which
are related to chambered long barrows are found near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
St. Asaph and in Caithness;<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> and other chambered cairns
and chambered round barrows, which belong to the latest
period of the Stone Age or to a time of transition, exist
in Orkney, Inverness-shire, Argyllshire and some of the
adjoining islands, the Holm of Papa Westray, Derbyshire,
Wales, Cornwall and the Scilly Isles, and the islands of
the Channel.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></p>

<p>The materials of which these monuments are composed
vary of course according to the nature of the country in
which they were erected. Stone was used where it was
abundant, and earth or rubble where stone was not to be
obtained. The significance of the barrows lies not in their
substance but in their form; but it is probable that the
absence of chambered barrows in South Wiltshire and
Dorsetshire, where unchambered ones are common, is due
simply to lack of the necessary stones.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> The eminent
Swedish archaeologist, Nilsson, argued that the ‘passage-graves’,
or chambered barrows, of Scandinavia were designed
on the model of subterranean dwellings; but the little
evidence that remains tends to show that no such analogy
existed here; and the Eskimos and Lapps, whose dwellings
Nilsson had in view, bury their dead in tombs of a different
kind.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> Antiquaries who have had experience in opening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
chambered and unchambered barrows consider that the
two classes were erected in the same period;<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> and the
nature of the interments, as we shall presently see, justifies
this conclusion.</p>

<p>The orientation of the long barrows and of the chambered
cairns which are classed with them seems to show that the
builders intended that the spirits of the dead might look
upon the rising sun. The axis of the barrow or cairn
generally lies either due east and west or in a direction
approximating more or less closely thereto; and the broader
and higher end of the barrow, where, as a rule, the sepulchral
deposits are found,<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> generally faces eastward. In a few
instances the axis lies between the north and the south,
the broad end pointing sometimes northward, sometimes
southward. When the direction is not due east, it varies
between north-north-east and south-east; and one may
reasonably conclude that this variation depended upon the
place of sunrise at the time of the year when the barrow
was erected. Similar varieties, combined with the same
general tendency to point the barrow towards the east, have
been observed in the neolithic tombs of other countries.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_16" src="images/fig_16.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span></p></div>

<p>Long barrows vary greatly, not only in their materials
and orientation, but also in their size and shape. Many of
them exceed a hundred feet in length; and the chambered
barrow of West Kennet is three hundred and thirty-five
feet long and seventy-five broad at its eastern end.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> More
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
striking, however, than the mere dimensions of a long
barrow is the disproportion between its whole extent and
that part of it in which alone the dead were laid. The
immense toil which must have been expended in constructing
such a monument by labourers who had only
deer-horn picks and stone tools proves not only density
of population, effective organization, and the despotism
which the chiefs must have exercised, but also a religious
awe the compelling force of which we, who live in a world
that has grown old, can hardly conceive. Some of the
mounds might in outline be compared to a very elongated
egg, others to one-half of a pear cut lengthwise and
laid upon its flat side.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> The trenches from which the material
was excavated extend along their sides, but never encircle
the ends.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> The chambered barrows are of many kinds, no
two being exactly alike. Some have a central gallery,
entered by a doorway at the broad end, so low that it is
necessary to stoop or even to crawl. Generally the chambers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
placed opposite one another in one, two, three, or
even six pairs, open out of the gallery like the chapels in
a Gothic cathedral; while occasionally, as at West Kennet,
the gallery leads to a terminal chamber; and in other
instances both lateral and terminal chambers are found.
At Rodmarton and Nether Swell in Gloucestershire there
is no gallery; and the chambers open externally. Galleries
and chambers are alike built of stones set on edge, which
(the interstices being filled in with dry walling) support
flags laid horizontally across; though occasionally, as at
Stoney Littleton in Somersetshire, the roof is constructed
of converging layers of stones which form a rude arch.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a>
Some so-called chambered barrows, for instance Littleton
Drew in Wiltshire, have no chambers, but only cists, or
shallow graves excavated in the soil and built up with
stone slabs. The mounds were generally faced with dry
walling; and on the chalk downs of North Wiltshire, where
blocks of sandstone abounded, the wall was often, as at
West Kennet, surrounded by a peristalith formed of stones
erected at regular intervals. These stones have disappeared;
but drawings, made in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, show what they were like.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> The architects were
inspired by a vivid sense of beauty. The enclosing wall,
as it approached the broad and high end of the barrow,
was turned inwards by gradual and graceful curves, which
generally terminated in great stones that served as the
jambs of the entrance. Even when there was no gallery,
this symmetrical curve was still adopted, and its termination
marked by monumental pillars.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> The Wor Barrow on
Cranborne Chase, an oval mound of such uncommon form
that Pitt-Rivers, before he opened it, felt doubtful whether
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
it did not belong to the Bronze Age, appears to have been
a chambered sepulchre of an abnormal kind. When the
tumulus had been removed, a trench, enclosing an oblong
space, appeared in the chalk which had formed the old
surface. Stake-holes were detected in the trench; and
the famous antiquary concluded that the stakes had been
simply ‘a wooden version of the long chambers of stone’.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></p>

<p>Intimately related to
certain chambered long
barrows are the famous
horned cairns, which
exist only in Caithness.
Although their forms
also are various, the
larger cairn of Yarhouse
being extremely elongated
while that of
Ormiegill might be almost
exactly contained
within a perfect square,
the ruling idea remained
the same. The exterior
wall, which is always
double, develops eastward
and westward into
horn-shaped projections,
which curve outwards. Thus the four sides form four symmetrical
concave curves; whereas in English chambered
barrows, like that of Uley and some of the barrows at Upper
Swell in Gloucestershire,<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> the curvilinear projections which
correspond with the horns exist only at the eastern end. An
opening between the eastern horns in the Scottish cairns
gives access to the chamber, which is commonly divided
into three partitions by two pairs of stones, crossing the
side walls and leaving a passage between.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p>Just as the long are earlier than the short horned cairns,
so the latter are earlier than the round chambered cairns
of Scotland; for no horned cairns were erected after the
Scottish Bronze Age had begun, whereas, although the
round chambered cairns were developed towards the close
of the Neolithic Age, and although metal has never been
found in them,<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> their external form was reproduced in the
Bronze Age, when chambers were no longer built.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> The
chambers of the round cairns also are divided into sections;
and one of them, near Loch Etive in Argyllshire, shows
traces of an encircling trench and rampart.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> In Southern
Britain the chronological sequence was probably the same:
the round chambered cairns seem to be later than the
chambered long barrows. The Park Cwm tumulus in the
peninsula of Gower, which has a central avenue and two
pairs of opposite chambers opening out of it,<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> has been
likened to the Uley barrow; but its form is round. The
chambered tumulus of Plas Newydd Park in Anglesey,
which is roughly oval,<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> may possibly represent an earlier
and transitional form.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>Round chambered barrows exist in Derbyshire, the
design of which is purely local. Thus the Five-Wells
barrow, near Taddington, has two chambers, each of which
was approached by a gallery entered through a kind of
port-hole on either side of the mound. The skulls that
have been found in these tombs are of the neolithic type:
but a barrow on Derwent Moor, which is commonly assigned
to the same period,<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> contained an urn, ornamented
with designs characteristic of the Bronze Age, in which
a piece of copper was found;<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> and an experienced antiquary
has remarked that in cataloguing the remains found in the
Derbyshire barrows he ‘found it almost impossible to
separate the Neolithic from the Bronze Age interments’.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a>
In West Cornwall also there are gigantic chambered cairns,
round or oval, the date of which is uncertain. No bronze
has been found in them, but abundance of pottery, and
cists which are undoubtedly later than the chambers. One,
standing on the cliff which rises above Cape Cornwall,
contained a double-walled dome, and reminded its explorer
of the huge tope at Bhojpur.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a></p>

<p>Chambered cairns of a peculiar kind remain in Argyllshire
and the islands of Islay and Arran, the like of which
have been discovered nowhere else except on the opposite
coast of Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> Nearly all the pottery that has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
found in them closely resembles that of the dolmens of
North-Western France and the Pyrenees, while none exactly
like it has been exhumed in England; and, combining
these facts with the geographical position of the sepulchres
themselves, the antiquary who has explored them concludes
that their builders came late in the Neolithic Age from
Brittany, and, sailing up St. George’s Channel, settled on
the opposite shores of Scotland and Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> Physically,
however, they belonged, as their skeletons show, to the
same stock as the great majority of the neolithic people of
Britain.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg110" class="sidenote">Inhumation
and
incineration.</div>

<p>Here, as also in France<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> and Northern Germany,<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a>
funerals were performed both by inhumation and incineration.
In the barrows of South-Western Britain, cremation,
although not unknown, was very rare;<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> in Yorkshire<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> and
the chambered cairns of Bute,<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> almost universal. Judging
from the analogy of other countries and from the fact that
inhumation persisted into the Bronze Age, and then for
a long period was generally superseded by cremation,<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> it
seems probable that the latter was not introduced until
a comparatively late epoch.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> The two modes of burial
were, however, contemporaneous not only in different parts
of the country but in the same district and in the same
grave. Burnt and unburnt bones have been found lying
together in such a manner as to prove that they had been
interred at the same time.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> Cremation was generally performed
in the chamber or on the floor of the barrow where
the body was deposited.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> When the corpse was buried
entire, it was usually laid upon the ground<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> with the knees
doubled up towards the chin, or placed sitting in a similar
posture by the side of the tomb.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> This custom, which was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
almost universal in prehistoric times, and is still practised
by many savages, is best explained by the assumption that
it was thought seemly to bury the dead in the position in
which they had slept, and that, for the sake of warmth,
they had commonly lain down to rest in an attitude which
most of us have occasionally adopted for the same reason.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a>
In some barrows only single skeletons have been found;
but generally in unchambered barrows, where more than
two persons had been buried in one grave, the bones lay
heaped together as though the bodies had been unceremoniously
flung down;<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> while in certain cases they were
found disjointed in such wise that it was evident that the
dead had not been buried entire, or, as is often the case
in savage countries and even in Brittany and the Catholic
cantons of Switzerland, until long after the flesh had decayed.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a>
The Balearic islanders, in the time of Diodorus
Siculus,<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> used to sever the bodies of their dead in pieces
and inter them in urns; and the same practice prevailed
in Spain in the Age of Bronze.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> British explorers, moreover,
have often noticed, in opening barrows, that skeletons
were incomplete, many of the bones being absent.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> Since
the piled skeletons belonged to old and young, male and
female, it can only be concluded that corpses were often
stored, as in a mortuary, until a sufficient number had
accumulated, and then buried all together.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> In a barrow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
situated at Upper Swell in Gloucestershire, Rolleston found
evidence which convinced him that interments were sometimes
made successively upon the same spot. An undisturbed
skeleton was here surrounded by a great quantity of
bones, the arrangement of which was such that he was
forced to conclude that they had been displaced in order
to make room for it.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> In chambered barrows successive
interments were of course regular, gallery and chamber
being designed to admit them.</p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg112" class="sidenote">Human
sacrifice.</div>

<p>Thurnam was convinced that in the barrows which he
explored there were unmistakable evidences of human
sacrifice. In nearly all of them he found fractured skulls,
the broken edges of which were so sharp that he inferred
that the skull had been cleft in life by a club or a stone
axe; while in some cases one skull only was unmutilated.
His conclusion was that the few entire skulls were those of
chiefs or their relatives, while the others belonged to slaves
or captives who had been sacrificed. In one instance, in
which only two interments were met with, the broken skull
was that of a woman, while the bones of the other corpse,
which belonged to a man, had been imperfectly burned.
Thurnam argued that the burnt bones belonged to a chief,
and that the woman was his wife.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> Rolleston, on the other
hand, could see no reason for believing that the broken
skulls had been cleft deliberately.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> He pointed out that
the fragments were so numerous that if the persons to
whom they belonged had been sacrificed, they must have
been slaughtered by a succession of wanton blows; that
the fractures were utterly different from those of skulls
which are known to have been broken by deliberate blows,
and resemble those which have been caused by the shifting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
of soil or the collapse of stones; and he argues that from
what we know of the sentiments of savage and barbarian
peoples it is in the last degree improbable that slaves or
captives, if they had been sacrificed, would have been
allowed to repose side by side with their lords. Nevertheless
it is not safe to reject all the evidence which Thurnam
adduced. In a round barrow near Stonehenge Hoare found
a skull which appeared to have been cut in two as deftly
as by a surgical instrument;<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> and one may believe that
what was done in the Bronze Age was not unknown in the
Age of Stone. When we remember that evidences of
human sacrifice have been detected in French neolithic
tombs,<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> and that the practice was universal in ancient
times,<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> we shall be safe in assuming that neolithic Britain
was no exception to the rule that after a chieftain’s obsequies
his dependents were immolated in order that their souls
might be set free to minister to his.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg113" class="sidenote">Traces (?)
of cannibalism.</div>

<p>But Thurnam also believed that the long barrows contained
evidences of cannibalism.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> The numerous passages
in which ancient writers accused the inhabitants of the
British Isles of devouring their own kind refer mainly to
the Irish:<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> but they were speaking of their contemporaries;
and when some of the Yorkshire barrows were opened it
was evident that the flesh had been removed from the
bodies before they were interred.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> But even if cannibalism
was practised in our Neolithic Age, the motive was not
hunger. The numerous bones of oxen, swine, red deer,
goats, and horses<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> which are found in the barrows, mingled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
with fragments of pottery, prove that a funeral was an
occasion for a feast, and may show that, as in later times,
offerings were made to the ghosts of the dead.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> If human
flesh was eaten, it was doubtless in the hope that moral
qualities which had distinguished the dead might be absorbed
by the living.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg114a" class="sidenote">Interment
of animals.</div>

<p>Perhaps the most curious feature in neolithic interments
is that animals were sometimes buried entire.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> It is not
indeed surprising that at Eyford in Gloucestershire there
was buried with a woman a dog which may have been her
companion;<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> but in a long barrow near Stonehenge was
found the skeleton of a goose which had evidently not been
eaten.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> Was it a sign that neolithic people had the same
religious prejudice against eating geese which Caesar noted,<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a>
or had this goose been sacrificed?<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIII_Pg114b" class="sidenote">Religion.</div>

<p>We can hardly err in regarding the sepulchral monuments
on which such stupendous labour was expended as witnesses
of a belief which may be called religious, and perhaps as
a further illustration of the apophthegm, ‘The first begetter
of gods on earth was fear’.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> For if the spirits of ancestors
are believed by savage tribes to be on the whole well
disposed towards those whom they leave behind, yet when
their bodies do not receive due burial their wrath is terrible.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a>
The most eminent of modern French archaeologists maintains
that the dolmens, chambered tombs, and standing stones of
France were erected under the influence of Druids;<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> and in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
this country also the belief has long been growing that
Druidism was of non-Celtic and neolithic origin: but since
our knowledge of it is confined to the period when it was
a Celtic institution, we must defer our consideration of it.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a>
But, apart from the graves themselves, there is hardly any
certain evidence in our neolithic interments of religious
belief. While in France, Scandinavia, Northern Germany,
and other lands, the tombs of this period were stored with
implements, ornaments, and weapons, the spirits of which
were doubtless consecrated to the service of the dead,<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a>
such relics are so rare in Britain<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> that unless the barrows
were despoiled in bygone days by heedless explorers, we can
only suppose that it was not generally thought necessary
to provide those who had passed away with the means of
continuing their life in another world; and it may be that
the few arrow-heads, flakes, and other objects which have
been found in graves were rather intended as marks of
reverence or affection than for use.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> On the other hand,
some of the implements found in neolithic barrows are said
to have been intentionally broken;<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> and this is often done
by savages in the belief that the souls of the implements<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a>
may thus be set free to be of use to the spirits of the dead.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a>
The holes that are to be seen in the stones of dolmens in
many lands are here so rare<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> that we may hardly regard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
them as evidence of a belief that spirits must be allowed
an exit from their graves; although such a belief has been
common to many peoples, and may even linger on among
ourselves, as in France and Germany, in the superstition
which often impels survivors to open door or window when
life is ebbing away<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a>. It must be confessed that we know
little more of neolithic than of palaeolithic religion. Fetichism,
which is ubiquitous&mdash;the belief that spirits inhabit
or operate through stocks and stones and what not; the
belief by which the Dorsetshire peasant who treasures his
holed pebble for luck is still animated&mdash;may be assumed to
have belonged to both.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> The worship of saints may be
a survival of the worship of ancestors.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> The traces of the
adoration of wells and lakes and rivers which may still be
observed in the remoter parts of Great Britain and Ireland,
where peasants offer pence to the spirit of the spring, and
children were lately bidden to beware of the river-sprite
who was waiting to drown them, are undoubtedly linked
to a prehistoric faith;<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> and so is that superstition which
prevails in New Zealand, in the Malay Archipelago, and on
the banks of the Ganges, and which among the islanders
of St. Kilda and the Shetlanders of Scott’s day impelled
men to refuse aid to a drowning comrade because they feared
to balk the marine demon of his prey.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> Nor need we
doubt that, like other savages, our neolithic forefathers
saw sun, moon, and stars as living beings, or that, like
the Australian aboriginals and the nameless tribes who
passed on to the Greeks the myths which were by them
invested with poetic form, they invented stories to account
for the wonders which they saw in the starry heavens.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
Neither need we hesitate to believe that, as each clan had
its chief, so the clansmen saw, above elves and kelpies,
gnomes and goblins, rock-spirits and tree-spirits, the mightier
deities of Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, Fire, Water,
and Thunder.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> We may believe, if we please, that they
prayed, as savages, nay Christians, often pray, not that they
might become better, but that they might be better off.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a>
We may suppose too that magic, which is even now used
in remote villages as an engine of extortion,<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> was still a
power by which men strove to ensure supplies of food or
to make rain fall in time of drought, perhaps also a weapon
by which the man of intellect made himself obeyed. But
when we consider the infinite variety of forms which superstition
assumes, we see that it would be vain to contend
that any one belief now held by this or that savage tribe
was identically part of the faith that was professed in
Britain in the Neolithic Age. Even the fancy that an
ethereal soul survived bodily death may not have been
universal; and as the Tonga islanders and the Virginians
are said to have believed that only the souls of chiefs would
live again,<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> so it is conceivable that the slaves by whose
sweat were built the barrows in which their lords were to be
interred were regarded as doomed to annihilation. And
when we are told that some quaint superstition which the
folklorist discovers in Devonshire or the Highlands is non-Aryan,
and must therefore be traceable to the people who
were here before the first Celtic invader arrived, we may
ask how it is possible to disprove that it had been inherited
by the Celt from remote ancestors or had been borrowed
by him from non-Aryan tribes while he was still a wanderer.
We must be content, if we can but catch something of
the spirit of neolithic religion, to remain in blank ignorance
of its details. We must keep in mind that in unnumbered
centuries it cannot have remained the same, and that in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
diverse regions its manifestations must have been various.
We must not ask for more than the assurance that to the
herdsmen who pastured their cattle on our downs all
Nature was animated; that in their eyes ‘as the human
body was held to live and act by virtue of its own inhabiting
spirit-soul, so the operations of the world seemed to be
carried on by the influence of other spirits’;<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> and that, like
all savage and half-savage peoples, they were enslaved by
custom, fettered by taboos, and compelled, when they
were driven by necessity to violate them, to expiate their
offence by complex rites.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> It may, however, be presumed
that the religion of neolithic man progressed when he ceased
to be a wanderer, and especially when he began to till the
soil. Supernatural beings were not of necessity gods to be
worshipped; but when the god of a community became
the lord of its land, he was its protector, nay, its father,
who, in return for due reverence and sacrifice, would do his
utmost to guard it against human enemies and hostile
deities.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a></p>

<p>And perhaps, since primitive worship concerned the community
rather than the individual,<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> common superstitions
and participation in sacrificial feasts were already beginning
to do their work of creating the sense of kindred between
divers groups, out of which, ages later and after successive
new invasions, war and policy were to develop a
state.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a></p>

<p>We have gathered some scraps of information from the
tools and weapons and pottery, the dwellings and mines,
the graves and the skeletons of neolithic man. Can these
dry bones live? Only for him who has imagination, which,
as the historian whose own was supported by a vast armoury

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg121" class="sidenote">A Copper
Age preceded
the Bronze Age in
certain
countries,
but has
not been
proved to
have existed
in Britain.</div>

<p>Those who have learned to realize the extreme slowness
with which material culture was evolved in its earlier
stages would be disposed to doubt whether the first metallic
implements were made of bronze, and to ask whether, at
all events in some part of the world, the Neolithic must
not have merged into a Copper Age. It is easy to imagine
that the accidental melting of a piece of copper ore may
have suggested the possibility of fashioning the metal into
tools; and that inventive cutlers took impressions of stone
axes in clay, and found that they could make from them
copper axes which were not liable to break:<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> but one can
hardly believe that simultaneously the discovery should have
been made that the softness and bluntness of copper could
be remedied by mixing with it a small proportion of tin.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
It is indeed not inconceivable that bronze was the first
metal which was ever manufactured; for near the surface
copper ores often contain tin oxide; and it has been proved
that by smelting such ores bronze can be produced.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> But
of course only experiment could have shown that tools
made of this metal were better than copper. The Egyptians
were acquainted with the use of copper long before they
began to manufacture bronze;<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> and in many parts of the
British Isles as well as of the Continent copper implements
have been discovered which belonged to prehistoric times.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a>
But such discoveries do not necessarily prove the existence
of a Copper Age: they may often be accounted for by the
supposition that tin, which is far less widely distributed
than copper, was temporarily wanting. In many cases
implements of copper and of bronze have been met with
in intimate association; and sometimes copper implements
of advanced type with primitive bronze.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> When, on the
other hand, copper implements are repeatedly found in
deposits which are known to be older than the oldest bronze
in the districts in which they occur, the conclusion is irresistible
that they were used there before bronze was manufactured.<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a>
There was certainly a Copper Age in Mesopotamia,
Egypt, and Cyprus; and probably also in Hungary,
Northern Italy, Spain, and Ireland, with which, in ancient
times, Spain was closely connected, and in which copper
celts were unmistakably modelled upon those of stone:
but for Britain the evidence is not sufficient.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> We must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
assume then provisionally that in our island the metal
which was first used for cutting-tools was bronze.</p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg123" class="sidenote">Bronze
implements
used for
many
centuries
in Europe
before the
Iron Age.</div>

<p>Certain metallurgists, however, maintain that a Bronze
Age, properly so called, may never have existed; and that
iron may have been manufactured during and even before
the period to which the bronze tools that are exhibited in
museums belong. Iron was undoubtedly known to the
Egyptians at a very remote date, perhaps as early as bronze.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a>
Primitive methods of extracting iron from its ore, which
are still practised in India and Africa, require far less skill
than the manufacture of bronze: the metallurgists argue
that since iron is rapidly oxidized by air and moisture, the
iron tools which they assume to have been made in the
so-called Bronze Age must have perished in the conditions
to which most of the bronze tools that have been discovered
were exposed; and they insist that iron tools have actually
been found in association with objects of the early Bronze
and even of the late Neolithic Age.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>The inconsistency of these arguments is self-evident; and
if their authors had known the rudiments of archaeology,
they would never have published them.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> Hundreds of iron
weapons have been recovered from the Thames: a competent
archaeologist has affirmed that there was not one
which could not with certainty be attributed to some period
later than the Bronze Age; and since numerous articles
of stone and bronze have been found in the same bed, he
reasonably concludes that if iron implements had been
used in the Bronze Age, some few at least must have come
to light.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> Nor is there any reason to suppose that if iron
tools had been laid in graves of the Bronze Age, they would
necessarily have perished beyond recognition; for in the
famous Tyrolese cemetery of Hallstatt, and in many other
deposits that, like it, belonged to the transitional period
when bronze and iron were simultaneously used, the iron
objects, oxidized though they are, retain their distinctive
forms.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> Yet in the numerous British barrows of the Bronze
Age, and in the hoards of the same period that have been
unearthed in England, Scotland, and Wales, not a trace of
iron has ever been found.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> Nothing then can be more
certain than that in Britain, as in the rest of Europe, the
Iron Age was preceded by a long period during which the
only metals used were copper and bronze.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg124" class="sidenote">Where
did the
European
bronze
culture
originate?</div>

<p>Every antiquary knows that bronze did not reach this
country until long after it was first used in Southern Europe,
and that it was common in Egypt many centuries before;
but in what part of the world it was first manufactured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
remains an unsettled question.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a> The oldest piece of bronze
that has yet been dated was found at Mêdûm in Egypt,
and is supposed to have been cast about three thousand
seven hundred years before the birth of Christ. But the
metal may have been worked even earlier in other lands;
for a bronze statuette and a bronze vase, which were made
twenty-five centuries before our era, have been obtained
from Mesopotamia; and the craft must have passed through
many stages before such objects could have been produced.
Yet it would be rash to infer that either the Babylonians
or the Egyptians invented bronze; for neither in Egypt nor
in Babylonia is there any tin. Some archaeologist who
shall explore the virgin fields of the Far East may one day
be able to prove that bronze was worked by the Chinese,
in whose country both copper and tin abound, earlier
than by any other people; but even so it will still remain
doubtful whether the art was not independently discovered
elsewhere. There is no evidence that the bronze culture of
Mexico and Peru did not originate in America;<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> and although
it was once believed that all the tribes of Europe
ultimately derived their knowledge of the metal from Asia,<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a>
there are many who now maintain that it is impossible to
detect in European deposits of the Bronze Age the slightest
trace of Oriental origin.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg126a" class="sidenote">Origin and
affinities
of the

of Britain.</div>

<p>But whatever may have been the case in Southern lands,
there is no doubt that the knowledge of bronze came to this
country from abroad. The old theory that it was a result
of Phoenician commerce with Britain has long been abandoned;<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a>
and British bronze implements are so different
from those of Norway and Sweden, Denmark, and Hungary
that it cannot have been derived from any of those countries.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a>
German influence was felt at a comparatively late period;<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a>
but from first to last the British bronze culture was closely
connected with that of Gaul, and through Gaul with that
of Italy.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg126b" class="sidenote">Period of
its commencement.</div>

<p>The period when bronze first appeared in Britain can only
be approximately fixed. It is certain that in the south-eastern
districts iron tools began to be used not later than
the fourth century before the Christian era.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> The final
period of the British Bronze Age is marked by the discovery
of bronze-founders’ hoards, all of which contain tools or
fragments of tools which are known as socketed celts, or
other socketed instruments which were contemporary with
them. These hoards are so numerous and so widely diffused,
and the objects of which they are composed are so varied
in form, that the time during which they were deposited
cannot, in the opinion of experts, have been less than four
or five hundred years. But before the first socketed celt
was cast the bronze culture passed through earlier stages,
during which the flat celts that resembled those of stone were
being used, and then gradually giving way to improved
forms, which in their turn were succeeded by later developments.
The veteran archaeologist who has handled and
examined almost every specimen of these numerous varieties
has arrived at the conclusion that the British Bronze Age
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
must have begun at the latest between 1400 and 1200 <small>B.C.</small>;<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a>
and while no one would now contend for a later date, there
are some who maintain that bronze was first used in Britain
twenty centuries before the Christian era.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg127" class="sidenote">Physical
characters
of the late
neolithic
and early
bronze-using
invaders
of
Britain.</div>

<p>After the Bronze Age set in, as before the close of the
preceding period, bands of invaders, wholly different in physical
type from the neolithic aborigines, landed successively
through long ages upon our eastern and southern shores.
They came from the Netherlands, from Denmark and its
islands, perhaps also from Scandinavia and from Gaul.
They must not, however, be identified either with the
invaders who introduced the Celtic language into Gaul or
with any Celtic-speaking people. There is no evidence,
and it is in the last degree improbable, that any Celtic tribe
had appeared in Gaul at the time when the alien immigrants
began to settle in Britain, or that Celtic had then taken
shape as a branch of the Indo-European language. Those
immigrants have often been described as a tall, stalwart,
round-headed race; but the evidence of sepulchral remains
shows that they sprang from various stocks. Those of the
type which is commonly regarded as specially characteristic
of the Bronze Age were taller and much more powerfully
built than the aborigines: their skulls were comparatively
short and round; they had massive jaws, strongly marked
features, enormously prominent brow ridges and retreating
foreheads; and their countenances must have been stern,
forbidding, and sometimes almost brutal. Similar skulls,
which have much in common with the primitive Neanderthal
type,<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> have been exhumed from neolithic tombs in
Denmark and the Danish island of Falster. But the skeletons
which have been found in some of the oldest Scottish
cists belonged to men whose average height, although
they were sturdy and thickset, was barely five feet three
inches, and whose skulls, shorter and rounder than the
others, as well as their milder features, proved that they
were an offshoot of the so-called Alpine race of Central
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
Europe, of which there were numerous representatives in
Gaul. Again there were tall men with skulls of an intermediate
type; while others, who combined harsh features
and projecting brows with narrow heads, and whose stature
was often great, would seem to have been the offspring of
intermarriage between the older and the newer inhabitants.
Not a single skeleton of the characteristic British round-barrow
type is known to have been discovered on French
soil: the round-headed inhabitants of Gaul were as conspicuously
short as those of Britain were generally tall;
nor, excluding the Britons of the Alpine stock, was there
any physical resemblance between the two peoples. The
British invaders of the Alpine stock, judging from the
pottery which was found with their skeletons, came for the
most part, as we shall afterwards see, not from Gaul but
from the valley of the Rhine. Moreover, the round-headed
people of Gaul settled there first early in the Neolithic Age,
before a Celtic word was spoken; and although their descendants
formed the substratum of the Gallic population who,
in Caesar’s time, called themselves Celts, that name was
introduced by conquerors of a wholly different stock. Probably
a Celtic invasion of Britain took place before the
British Iron Age began: but the remains of such invaders
are not recognizable in any British graves.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg128" class="sidenote">Their
social organization.</div>

<p>Each of the invading clans was doubtless ruled by a chief;
for many of the burial mounds which they erected were
intended for the great alone, and could only have been
constructed by the organized labour of many hands.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> They
must have respected family ties; for women and even
babies were interred with scrupulous care; and more than
one barrow was reared for the reception of a single child.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a>
Yet infants have so often been found buried along with
women that one can only conclude that infanticide was as
prevalent in ancient as in modern Britain.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> Only the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
children were slain because their mothers could no longer
nurse them, not because they desired to rid themselves of
trouble.</p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg129a" class="sidenote">Character
and results
of the invasions:
the invaders
poor in
bronze
weapons.</div>

<p>In Wiltshire and other parts of Southern Britain the old
population would seem to have been largely dispossessed
or subdued; but the skeletons found in the barrows of
Derbyshire and Staffordshire, of Yorkshire and the other
northern counties, indicate that there the immigrants
mingled more or less peacefully with the people whom they
came among.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> Fighting no doubt took place everywhere;
but the notion that bronze weapons gave the first invaders
victory is disproved by the fact that in the earlier part of
the era bronze was both costly and rare.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> If chieftains
had bronze, their clansmen were still armed with old-fashioned
weapons; and until the new age was far advanced,
the neolithic tribes, in so far as they were conquered, must
have yielded to superior numbers, superior skill, or superior
strength. Probably in certain districts they were never
conquered, and never permitted the intruders to dwell
among them. Among a vast number of stone implements
that have been found lying on the moors west of Rochdale
and Ashton-under-Lyne bronze was searched for in vain;<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a>
and one may provisionally infer that these hillmen were
protected by the strength of their territory.</p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg129b" class="sidenote">Evidence
of finds
as to the
settlements
of
the invaders.</div>

<p>Bronze implements or other relics of the Bronze Age
have been found in almost every county of England, Wales,
and Scotland, and in some of the adjoining islands;<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> but their
distribution appears to imply that, as might have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
inferred from the geographical features, some districts were
far more densely populated than others. The lands which
the new comers selected were mainly those which were
already occupied by the neolithic inhabitants. The relics
are most abundant in those which are now most sparsely
peopled, but which were then sought after because, even
when the soil was poor, it was dry, well-watered, and comparatively
open. The moors of Derbyshire, Yorkshire and
other Northumbrian counties, Devonshire and Cornwall;
the bracing uplands of East Anglia; the downs of Kent,
Surrey, Sussex, Berkshire, Hampshire, Dorsetshire, and
Wiltshire; and the wolds of Lincolnshire,&mdash;these were the
tracts which the immigrants occupied in the greatest numbers.
The Midlands, on the other hand, would seem to have
attracted comparatively few: Durham, for some unexplained
reason, was generally avoided;<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> while the northern
and north-western tracts of Scotland were almost entirely
neglected.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> The Yorkshire Wolds afford an interesting
example of the motives which determined the choice of abode.
Their scanty vegetation could not have tempted a people
who depended for their subsistence mainly upon their
flocks and herds; yet the numerous barrows with which
they are studded and the flint implements which have
been picked up in thousands from their surface prove that
they were as thickly peopled as any other part of Britain.
The reason was that they were unencumbered by the
forests which could only have been cleared by arduous
labour; their climate was healthy; and, above all, they
were so completely isolated by the wooded valley of the
Derwent, the swamps of Holderness, the broad estuary of
the Humber, and the morasses which then covered the plain
of York, that their occupants were secure from all attack.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p>In certain parts of England the routes by which invaders
advanced may be traced by the sites at which bronze implements
have been found. In Worcestershire, for example,
these spots have been mapped along the line of the Avon
from Warwickshire to the Severn, and again in the valley
of the latter river, where it was apparently crossed by ancient
trackways. The implements in these two counties belong
to comparatively late periods.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a></p>

<p>The settlements must often have been desperately resisted,
more and more as time passed and unoccupied lands became
rare. But it would be a mistake to assume that the struggle
was always between aboriginal communities and round-headed
invaders. There must have been much intermingling
between the old population and the new: gradually the use
of bronze weapons must have spread to neolithic clans or
to those who could obtain them by barter or theft; and by
the time when the Bronze Age was far advanced tribes of
mingled stock must often have presented a united front
to enemies from over sea. Even when the invaders
had slowly made their way from the Channel to the far
north, and from the German Ocean to the Irish Sea, hunger
or the lust of booty would often lead to intertribal raids.
Gradually weapons were improved; and we shall presently
endeavour to trace their evolution. Even to the very end
of the period, however, not only the rank and file but the
wealthiest chief, who had a complete set of bronze implements
and weapons, and who could afford to decorate
the handle of his blade with ivory, amber, or gold, to wear
gold buttons on his clothing, sometimes even to adorn his
charger with a gold peytrel, shot arrows tipped with flint.
Flint arrow-heads, leaf-shaped and barbed, have been found
by thousands in deposits of the Bronze Age, but in this island
never one of bronze. Even when daggers had given place
to swords and bronze spears were common, battle-axes
were made not of bronze but of stone.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg132a" class="sidenote">Stone implements

<p>Stone implements indeed, such as were in use in the
Neolithic Age, have been found so often in the graves of
chieftains associated with those of bronze that we may be
sure that, at least in the earlier part of the Bronze Age,
even the wealthier classes could not afford to discard the
older material; while among the needy population of the
Yorkshire Wolds many barrows contained no implements
except those of flint or bone.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a> Bronze saws have very rarely

enough in Southern Europe;<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> and since all our bronze
gouges are comparatively late,<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> it may be inferred that during
the earlier Bronze Age these tools were everywhere still
made of flint. In the west of Scotland, at all events, metal
tools were apparently unknown until long after the first
round-headed people landed, and probably until long after
bronze had begun to be used in Southern Britain.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> We
may indeed be sure that the Stone Age continued for
centuries later in remote parts of the country; and perhaps
in certain islands bronze may have remained unknown.</p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg132b" class="sidenote">Hill-forts.</div>

<p>When a clan had succeeded in establishing itself, it had
to provide for its protection against cattle-lifters and slave-hunters;
and gradually and by immense labour great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
strongholds were constructed on suitable sites. Comparatively
rare in the south-east, they are conspicuous on nearly
all the hilly districts of England, Wales, and Scotland;<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> but
it is in the western and south-western counties that they
most abound. Devonshire and the adjacent parts of Somersetshire
contain not less than eighty; and almost every
spur on Salisbury Plain is fortified.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> The multiplicity of
these camps bears witness not only to density of population
and constant warfare, but also to the utter disunion which
existed at the time when they were constructed. Supposing
that the majority of the forts in Dorsetshire, for instance,
were built in the Late Celtic Period, we should have to conclude
that the Durotriges, who then inhabited that district,
were merely a loose aggregate of scores of clans, ever ready
to prey upon one another; for if the forts had been destined
only to repel the attacks of some other tribe, they would
hardly have been so numerous and so widely scattered.
It is true that the Gallic Morini in Caesar’s time had not
become welded into one state, and that the Kentish clans
were under four petty kings; but in the period when the
older earthworks were thrown up it would seem that far
less progress had been made towards union. But even
supposing that most of the prehistoric forts were later than
the Bronze Age, their purpose accorded with the methods
of primitive warfare. A chain of modern fortresses impedes
an invader because, while they remain uncaptured, he
cannot pass between them without exposing his line of
communication. But in ancient times, when one tribe
attacked another, it had no communications to guard:
the invaders carried their food with them, and when it was
spent trusted for support to the enemy’s country.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a> If a

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>The form, construction, and materials of British forts
are naturally diverse. In Cornwall, Devonshire, Wales,
and other places they were of course built largely or wholly
of stone, the masonry being always uncemented: elsewhere
they were true earthworks. Leaving out of sight the
question of their date, they may be grouped in three classes.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a>
The first comprises those that were erected on promontories
or other heights which on one or more sides were fortified
by precipice, river, or sea. Such was the fort of Carl’s
Wark in Derbyshire, which, on three sides, rises almost
sheer above the swamps of Hathersage Moor. On the west,
where the ground slopes towards the plain, a huge earthen
rampart, faced with dry masonry, afforded secure protection;
and the slopes below the eastern and southern sides
are strewn with great stones which must have fallen from
the walls above.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> The ‘cliff-castles’ on the coasts of
Kirkcudbright and of Wales and on the headlands between
the Land’s End and Cape Cornwall belong to the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
group.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> In the second class the entrenchments, traced upon
commanding sites, which, however, were nowhere so steep
as to dispense with artificial aid, followed the tactical line
of defence which the nature of the hill indicated. Most
of the heights on which they stand are covered with soil
so thin that they never could have been thickly wooded,
and if trees had encumbered their sides they would have
been cut down; for the object of the engineers was to leave
no ‘dead ground’ on which an assailant could conceal
himself. If he felt strong enough to lead his clansmen to
the assault, he knew that they could not avoid being exposed
from the moment when they penetrated within the range
of a bow or a sling. General Pitt-Rivers, who did so much
to illuminate the study of prehistoric fortifications, was never
weary of calling attention to the skill with which they had
been designed. Once only, when he was exploring the camp
at Seaford, he thought that he could detect evidence of
neglect. As he stood upon the rampart he noticed that an
advancing force would be able to conceal itself for a while.
Presently, however, it flashed across his mind that time had
done its work upon rampart and ditch; and soon excavation
proved that the latter had lost by silting seven feet of its
original depth. The general saw with delight that the designer
had been as vigilant as any of his contemporaries.
The rampart in ancient times must have been at least
five feet higher; and then the garrison who manned it would
have been able instantly to detect the first enemy who
ventured within range. ‘How carefully,’ he wrote, ‘the
defenders economized their interior space, drawing their
rampart just far enough down the hill to obtain a command
of view, but not one yard further.’<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a></p>

<p>In certain cases, however, the hill was so extensive that
if the tactical line of defence had been slavishly followed,
the defenders would have been too few. Then the chief
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
engineer modified the accepted principle. Selecting a spot
at which he might safely abandon the natural line, he made
his sappers build a cross rampart at right angles to it straight
across the hill-top until it joined the works on the further
side. An example of this device may be seen in the camp
of Puttenham in Surrey.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a></p>

<p>Among the more famous strongholds of the second class
are Cissbury on the South Downs, which, as we have seen,
was almost certainly erected in the Neolithic Age,<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> Badbury
Rings, and the Maiden Castle. This noble fortress must
surely have deserved its modern name. No British force
could ever have taken it: no other country can show its
match. Three lines of ramparts defend the northern and
four the southern side: gaining the summit of the road
from Weymouth, you see them outlined against the sky;
and as you mount the hill-side, they rise, one behind another,
like veritable cliffs. Worn by the rains of five-and-twenty
centuries or more, they still stand sixty feet<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> above their
fosses; and their entrances, on the east and the west,
are guarded by overlapping works so intricate that if a
column had succeeded in forcing its way across the abatis,
it would have found itself helplessly winding in and out as
through a labyrinth, pounded on either flank and enfiladed
by stones and arrows discharged at point-blank range.</p>

<p>The strongholds of the third class were erected on lower
hills or on high ground little elevated above the surrounding
country, and therefore depended less for their protection
upon natural features.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> Those that have been explored
belong to the Late Celtic Period.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> It may be doubted,
however, whether such forts were generally later than those
whose sites were more commanding; for the inhabitants
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
of every district could only choose the best positions which
they could find.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a> Cherbury camp indeed, about four
miles south-east of Fyfield in Berkshire, was built on a lowland
plain.</p>

<p>Some of the Gallic forts which Caesar saw, and of our
own, were in his time inhabited by large industrial communities;
but although many of the British strongholds
which belonged to the Bronze Age contain the foundations
of huts and broken pottery,<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> it is doubtful whether they
had more than a few occupants except in time of war.<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a></p>

<p>Every explorer who has tried to imagine the conditions
of life in ancient British forts has noticed that many of them
have no apparent source from which water can be obtained.
It has indeed been suggested that where there was neither
a spring nor running water within reach the garrison had
recourse to dew-ponds, which are still used for watering
cattle on the Hampshire downs.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a> But even these reservoirs
were generally lacking. Pitt-Rivers, however, argued that
in the chalk districts many sites which are now remote from
water may have possessed springs. At the village of Woodcuts
in Cranborne Chase, after cleaning out a Roman well,
one hundred and eighty-eight feet deep, he found no water,
but the iron-work of a bucket.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> But even where there was
no spring it is easy to understand how the garrison supplied
themselves. None of these camps was ever subjected to a
prolonged siege. No army can undertake such an operation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
unless it can ensure a continuous supply of food; and
to do this requires forethought and organization of which
barbarous clans are incapable. Again and again the Gauls
with whom Caesar contended, whose civilization was far
more advanced than that of the Britons of the Bronze Age,
were obliged to abandon movements that might otherwise
have succeeded, simply because their commissariat
had been neglected.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a> When ancient Britons were obliged
to take refuge in their stronghold, they knew that the danger
would pass if they could hold out for a little while. Women
and children who failed to reach the entrenchment in time
were doubtless slain or enslaved. But otherwise the worst
that was to be dreaded was the loss of crops or stock and the
destruction of dwellings. We may suppose that while
the cattle were being driven into the fort the women carried
up in vessels of skin or earthenware as much water as
would suffice for a few days. Such was the practice of the
Maoris at a recent time.<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg139a" class="sidenote">Primitive
metallurgy.</div>

<p>In spite of war industrial arts were making progress,
which was stimulated by war itself. Copper was abundant
in Cornwall, Cardiganshire and Anglesey, and near Llandudno:
tin was to be had near the surface in Cornwall,<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a>
and perhaps first attracted attention where it was associated
with gold; native smiths began to copy the tools which
were brought from abroad; and insular forms were gradually
evolved. Among the immigrants there must have been
some who were acquainted with metallurgy; and just as
the modern coach-builder finds himself obliged to manufacture
motor-cars, so, we may be sure, the more enterprising
cutlers who had hitherto made stone implements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
gradually learned to produce tools of copper or bronze.
The metals were of course not at first procured by mining.
Copper would be obtained from boulders or from lumps
of ore on hill-sides, and tin from the gravel beds of streams.
The methods, which have been recorded by modern observers,
of primitive communities are probably much the same
as those of the Britons of the Bronze Age. The original
furnaces differed hardly at all from the fires at which food
was cooked. The fire was kindled within a fire-place of
large stones, underneath which was a pit. The wind,
rushing through the crevices of the stones, created a draught,
which may have been forced by some rude bellows. After
the embers and the slag had been raked away the molten
metal in the pit was watched until it was on the point of
becoming solid, when the copper cakes were snatched out
and broken into the lumps of which specimens have been
found in bronze-founders’ hoards. For the smelting of tin
a method may have been adopted which was still practised
in Germany in the Middle Ages. A trench was filled with
brushwood, above which logs were piled; and as soon as the
fuel was aglow the ore was pitched on to the fire until a
sufficient amount had accumulated. Then the embers were
raked away, and the molten tin ladled out.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> It is worthy
of remark that all the Scottish bronze implements which
had been analysed up to the year 1880 contained lead;<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a>
and one may perhaps infer that the tin which was exported
from Cornwall to Scotland was not pure.</p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg139b" class="sidenote">Bronze
Implements:&mdash;celts.</div>

<p>Many bronze implements were reproductions, more or
less modified, of neolithic models. Stone celts, knives,
daggers, spear-heads, awls, chisels, gouges, sickles, and
saws have their successors in bronze. Gradually, however,
new forms were developed or invented. Bronze was of
course at first reserved for weapons; and knives or knife-daggers
probably preceded all others, because the metal
was originally too scarce and expensive to be used for those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
which required a large expenditure of material.<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> Flat
axes, resembling more or less closely the polished neolithic
celts, were, however, manufactured early in the Bronze
Age. After some time the sides of the narrow part of the
celt, above the cutting edge, were hammered upwards,&mdash;probably
in order to steady the blade against a lateral
strain; and thus by insensible gradations the flat was
transformed into the flanged celt; while a projection,
commonly called a stop-ridge, was cast on the narrow
part of the blade with the object of preventing it from being
forced too far into its wooden haft. As the flanges became
more marked, they were first confined to the upper part of
the tool, and afterwards developed into wings which were
hammered inwards so as to form a kind of rudimentary
socket.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a> Celts of this form are called palstaves,&mdash;a word
of Icelandic origin, which denotes a spade. In palstaves
of another kind the part between the wings and above the
stop-ridge was cast thinner than the rest, so that a groove
appeared into which the haft could be securely fitted;
and a loop was often added at one side to enable the attachment
to be secured by bands of twine.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> The final improvement
was to cast the blade with a socket for the reception
of the handle: but palstaves remained in use down to the
very end of the Bronze Age;<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> while in some socketed celts
the wings survive as mere ornaments upon the sides.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> Like
palstaves nearly all socketed celts are looped on one side,
and a few on both.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> Naturally the socket was not limited
to celts, but applied also to knives,<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> chisels,<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a> gouges,<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> and
other tools. Socketed knives, however, are very rare in
Scotland; and on the Continent, except in Northern France,
they are almost unknown.<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> On the other hand the patterns

derived from some foreign source.<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a></p>

<p>The earliest British celts were copied not from stone
models but from foreign ones of bronze;<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> and our winged
celts and palstaves resemble certain French specimens
so closely that they too were probably modelled in the
first instance upon the latter.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a> The socket also was invented
by some ingenious foreign cutler;<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> for palstaves
with the wings bent over are rare in this country, whereas
socketed celts with ornamental wings are common.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> Socketed
celts were apparently never widely diffused in Northern
Britain; and of course even in the south they did not
altogether displace palstaves.<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> Even after they began to
be manufactured here the output was supplemented by
importation from Gaul: a certain type, the blades of
which, instead of expanding, are long and narrow, and
the sockets almost square, occurs frequently in North-Western
France and our southern counties, but very seldom
in the north.<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a></p>

<p>Bronze celts in general, like those of stone, were doubtless
used for various purposes&mdash;as hoes, hatchets, and possibly
battle-axes&mdash;and some, which are very narrow or
very small, as chisels.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> Palstaves were sometimes used,
as their name would suggest, in the construction of earthworks.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg144" class="sidenote">Sickles.</div>

<p>Sickles probably originated in Southern Europe. The
few early specimens that have been found here have their
closest analogies in France and Denmark; but, for some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
unknown reason, socketed sickles are almost peculiar to
the British Isles.<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg145a" class="sidenote">The Arreton
Down
hoard.</div>

<p>A hoard was found early in the eighteenth
century on Arreton Down, near Newport in
the Isle of Wight, which helped to illustrate
the evolution of bronze weapons. Daggers,
which differed from knives principally in size,
though they began to be manufactured later,
were originally hafted with rivets; but afterwards
they were cast with tangs or shanks,
which were let into the handle, and fastened
by a single rivet.<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a> The Arreton Down hoard
contained nine tanged blades, which closely resemble
daggers but may have been spear-heads.
Many similar blades have been found since,
but hardly any outside the British Isles.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg145b" class="sidenote">Halberds.</div>

<p>From daggers were derived a class of
weapons very rare in this country, called
halberds, which in Scandinavia and Northern
Germany have been found mounted as battle-axes.
Heavier and broader than their prototypes,
they were often made of nearly pure
copper, which rendered them less brittle and
more suitable for dealing heavy blows.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg145c" class="sidenote">Shields,
swords,
spears.</div>

<p>Swords, shields, and, with certain exceptions,
spears and javelins were not manufactured
until the latest period of the Bronze
Age. Swords and spear-heads required great
skill in casting: shields were so thin that they
could not be cast at all, but were wrought
by the hammer.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> Even at the close of the
Bronze Age they were probably unobtainable
except by the rich, while the rank and file doubtless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
still made shift with bucklers of wicker-work, wood or
leather. The shields of the Bronze Age were invariably
circular. Nearly all were ornamented over their whole
surface with concentric rings, of which one example has
as many as thirty, separated by circles of small studs;
and this ornamentation is peculiarly British. One curious
shield, found in the Fen country, is adorned with serpentine
lines, which may have been intended to represent snakes.<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a></p>

<p>British bronze swords, like those of the Continent, from
which they were copied, are commonly of a type which is
called leaf-shaped, the blade tapering gently inwards from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
the hilt, then gradually expanding until, at about
one-third of the distance, measured from the
point, it attains its greatest width. They, as
well as certain rapier-shaped swords, were intended
for stabbing, not striking. Their length
was generally about two feet, but varied between
sixteen and thirty inches. Their sheaths
were as a rule made of wood or leather, which,
however, were often tipped with bronze; and
many of these tips or chapes have been found
in the Thames and elsewhere without the
scabbards, which had perished.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span> ¼</p></div>

<p>The spears of the earlier Bronze Age were
identical with neolithic flint weapons. Probably
the earliest bronze spear-heads were some of
the larger blades that have been found in Wiltshire
barrows, which are commonly described
as knives or daggers.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> Others were derived
from the tanged blades of the Arreton Down
type, if, indeed, the latter were not themselves
spear-heads. A curious and unique specimen,
which was found in the Thames at Taplow, and
is now in the British Museum, is ornamented
with gold studs on the bottom of the blade,
which are merely survivals of the rivets that
attached to its haft the dagger from which it
had been evolved.<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> Spear-heads of this kind,
which are invariably provided either with
a pair of holes in the blade or a pair of loops
below it, intended to secure its attachment to
the shaft,<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a> are extremely rare on the Continent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
and appear to have been invented in Ireland, whence they
spread in the course of trade to Britain.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> Another form
of spear-head, which originated in the British Isles and has
never been found elsewhere, was barbed, and seems to have
been used for hunting rather than in war.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> The commonest,
however, is the continental leaf-shaped
type, some specimens of which have
analogies in Gaul and the Swiss lake-dwellings.<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a>
The smaller weapons of the
spear-head class were doubtless javelins.<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg148" class="sidenote">Moulds.</div>

<p>Many of the moulds in which weapons
and implements were cast have been
preserved. Open moulds sufficed for flat
axes; but the more difficult operations
of casting palstaves and socketed celts
required that the moulds should be made
in halves. All the open ones that remain
were of stone; many others, however,
were doubtless formed of more perishable
materials, such as clay or compact sand.
Bronze moulds were also used; but the
only specimens which have been found
were for palstaves, socketed celts, and
gouges. There is a bronze mould in the
British Museum that was itself cast in
a mould of clay, formed round a model
palstave, and attached to it by string,
which was of course reproduced in the metal. Leaden celts
have once or twice been met with, which of course would have
been useless as cutting tools; and it is probable that they
were intended simply for making moulds of clay or sand.
Bronze moulds were costly, and would soon wear out. It
has been suggested therefore that, just as a printer uses in
his press not his original wood-block but an electrotype
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
copy, so the bronze-founder generally reserved his bronze
moulds for making leaden models from which any number
of clay moulds could be formed.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> Sockets were produced
by means of clay cores, which were inserted in the moulds.
Socketed celts have so often been found in hoards with the
cores remaining in them that we may reasonably conclude
that they were bartered by the bronze-founders in this
state, and that, as in the Neolithic Age, the purchasers
finished them with their own hands.<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a> The hammers and
anvils which were used in the final stage of manufacture
were commonly stone, though a few light bronze hammers
have been unearthed; and the decoration was applied by
means of punches.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg149a" class="sidenote">Decoration
of
weapons.</div>

<p>The patterns with which weapons were decorated are
worth noticing even by those to whom archaeology for its
own sake makes no appeal. Daggers and flat or slightly
flanged celts were incised with rectilinear figures and
chevrons only:<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a> winged celts, palstaves, socketed celts, and
spear-heads have similar designs in a few instances,<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> but
for the most part they are ornamented with concentric
circles. The significance of these facts will become apparent
when we come to deal with certain chronological questions
relating to the Bronze Age.<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg149b" class="sidenote">Hoards.</div>

<p>What we know of the metal-work of this period has been
learned mainly from buried hoards which were never recovered
by their owners, and of which more than a hundred
have been unearthed in Great Britain from Cornwall to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Sutherland.<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a> These hoards were of three kinds.<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a> Some,
consisting entirely of newly-made articles, belong to
traders. Others, which comprise damaged or broken goods,
and include moulds and often cakes of copper, represent
the stock-in-trade of bronze-founders, who tramped over
the country-side, and were ready to cast implements or
ornaments of the latest fashion and to melt and recast old
ones for anybody who could give them what they wanted
in exchange. The tools in these collections were for the
most part broken intentionally to make them more portable
and ready for the crucible.<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> Other hoards again, which
frequently comprise ornaments, alone or associated with
implements, were the property of persons who were not in
the trade. Hoards were of course buried when robbers
were about or when some marauding clan appeared. By
far the greater number belong to the latest period of the
Bronze Age,<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> which shows that in earlier times the craft
had not been specialized, or that people who could afford
to buy bronze implements were so few that no travelling
dealer could make a fair profit. Those who then possessed
bronze tools must have made them for themselves unless
there happened to be a skilled craftsman near who could
earn a living by working for his neighbours.</p>

<p>The great improvement of tools and weapons would lead
us to look for traces of corresponding progress in every
department of material culture.</p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg150" class="sidenote">Pasturage.</div>

<p>Pasturage of course continued to be the mainstay of the
mass of the population; and although there were probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
few households which did not subsist partly upon the chase,
the remains of funeral feasts in barrows and the refuse
heaps of dwellings show that game was eaten much less
than the flesh of domestic animals. It has been said
that sheep were not introduced into Britain before the
Roman conquest; but excavation has proved that they
were bred by the bronze-using inhabitants of Dorsetshire.<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a>
Besides the small cattle that were common in the Neolithic
Age large oxen were reared, at all events on Cranborne
Chase and the Yorkshire Wolds; and, as in the Neolithic
Age and doubtless for the same reason, animals were commonly
slaughtered before they had reached maturity.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a>
Although bronze fish-hooks, almost identical in form with
our own hooks of steel, abounded in the Swiss lake-dwellings,
and were present in more than one of the hoards that have
been unearthed in France, only a single specimen has yet
come to light in the British Isles: but it need not be inferred
that the Britons had no taste for fish; for they probably
caught trout and salmon with nets or spears.<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a></p>

<p>The growth of population was indeed making it difficult
for men to provide for their families; and they were constrained
to toil harder in order to avoid starvation. Under
<span id="PI_CIV_Pg151" class="sidenote">Agriculture.</span>
this pressure agriculture began to flourish; and wheat was
grown at least as far north as Yorkshire.<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> Armed with
bronze axes, the husbandmen were better able to clear
forests and to bring new land under cultivation; and at
harvest time, when they reaped their reward, then, we
may be sure, the clansmen gathered, and sacrificed to their
god, and held high festival.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a> Their labours are attested
not only by numerous stone mullers and by the sickles
that have been already mentioned, one of which was found
even in Aberdeenshire, but also, as we have already seen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
by the teeth of the skeletons in the barrows.<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> Oxen were
probably used in ploughing.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> Horses, which were very
small, were domesticated, and in certain parts of the country
eaten,<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> but they were not common; and, although the rock-carvings
of Scandinavia and the bridle-bits and wooden
wheels that have been found on the sites of Swiss lake-dwellings
show that in the Bronze Age men had learned to
ride and drive,<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> similar evidence is wanting in Britain.
Looped bronze plates, however, have been found in a hoard
at Abergele, which are supposed to have been a jingling
ornament, attached to harness; and some small bells, found
at Dowris in Ireland, resemble those which occasionally
form a part of modern horse-trappings.<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> Oxen indeed, if
not horses, must have been required for hauling timber
even in neolithic times when clearings had to be made;
and the wagons which conveyed tin to the coast when
Pytheas visited Cornwall<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> had probably been in use long
before his time.</p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg152" class="sidenote">Signs of
amelioration
in the
conditions
of life.</div>

<p>Certain facts seem to indicate that the conditions of life
in the Bronze Age were becoming more favourable to
longevity, and in particular that women were better off
than before. Famines indeed must still have occurred;
for of course there were bad harvests from time to time,
and cattle then, as now, were liable to disease, and doubtless
often perished in hard winters. But the disparity in stature
between men and women was far less than it had been in
the Neolithic Age;<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> and Thurnam estimated the average
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
age of the people of the round barrows whose skeletons he had
examined at fifty-five, eight years more than that of the
aboriginals.<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> It has been affirmed that even the primitive
Aryans often put old people to death;<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> but skeletons have
been exhumed in Britain which showed signs of extreme age.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg153a" class="sidenote">Dwellings.</div>

<p>One might be inclined to suppose that this amelioration
was partly due to improved housing; but such evidence
as exists tends to show that the habitations of the Bronze
Age, although, owing to improved tools, they may have
been better built, were designed on much the same lines
as those of the preceding epoch. Pit-dwellings, like those
which have been already described,<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> were still constructed
in districts where stone was not obtainable. Very few,
as we have seen, can be even approximately dated; but
some which have been excavated at Hitcham in Buckinghamshire
and in the fort of Eggardun on the Dorsetshire
downs contained pottery which made it safe to assign
them to the Bronze Age.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a> It may be that some of the
Scottish subterranean dwellings which are known as weems
belong to the same period, for a bronze sword was found
in one at Monzie in Perthshire;<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a> and perhaps a few of the
so-called Picts’ houses and of the beehive huts in Cornwall
and North Britain, which will be described hereafter, were
built before iron was there used.</p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg153b" class="sidenote">Lake-dwellings.</div>

<p>It is, as we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> very doubtful whether any of the
lake-dwellings of Britain were older than the Bronze Age;
and it cannot be positively affirmed that any were as old.
One at Barton Mere in Suffolk, if it really was a lake-dwelling,<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a>
probably belonged to that time, although the only
implement found in it was a spear-head;<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> but the evidence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
for the date assigned to the well-known settlement at
Holderness is considerably stronger. It has been argued
that since both stone and bronze implements were found
there, the site must have been occupied before the Iron
Age, because, although in a time of transition the old material
may persist by the side of the new, implements of two
earlier periods would hardly survive into a third.<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg154" class="sidenote">Hut-circles.</div>

<p>There is, however, one class of dwellings numerous
examples of which have been proved to have existed in
the Bronze Age, if not before. The best-known groups of
hut-circles are those of Anglesey, Dartmoor, Cornwall, and
Northumberland. Sportsmen who have shot snipe in
Anglesey must have noticed low mounds dotting the rough
wastes which are common in the island. Buried beneath
these hillocks lie the foundations of huts which were built
in prehistoric times. Most of them are clustered in tiny
hamlets of five or six; but at Ty Mawr on the southern
slopes of the Holyhead Mountain, sheltered from the cold
winds by a precipitous cliff and fortified against attack
from below, was a considerable village, comprising more
than fifty huts. On a clear day the villagers could discern
the Wicklow Mountains; and the triple head of Snowdon,
haunted, as they surely believed, by some divinity, closed
their southward view. The lower walls of the huts, which
alone remain, are about three feet thick, and enclose spaces
of from fifteen to twenty feet in diameter, partitioned in
one instance by upright stones. The entrance, defined by
two pillars, invariably faces the south-west. Stones,
blackened by fire and doubtless used for cooking, were
found within, and also mullers for grinding corn, and the
broken shells of the limpets and periwinkles on which the
occupants partly lived. Some of the huts, however, appear
to have been simply workshops. They were littered with
broken quartz from a neighbouring copper lode: the fire-places,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
of which each contained two, one having a chimney
in the thickness of the wall, were strewn with slag; and
mortars and mullers abounded, which had been used not for
grinding corn but for breaking stone.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> Possibly the huts
may have been roofed with converging stones, laid one
above another in the beehive fashion; but some in Northumberland
and Devonshire contain central cavities, like
those of neolithic pit-dwellings, in which poles for supporting
a roof of boughs thatched with turf were apparently
fixed.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> Hut-circles everywhere present the same general
features; but of course there are numerous varieties of
size and construction. Nearly all the huts were round;
but a few in East Cornwall are oval;<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a> and while most of
the hamlets were enclosed by walls, some apparently did
not need protection,<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a> or were situated near a fort in which
the villagers could take refuge. Grimspound on Dartmoor,
the typical example of a fortified village, was apparently the
stronghold of the people whose huts were scattered on
the slopes hard by; and the dwellings which it enclosed
may have been occupied in time of peace only by caretakers.<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a>
Some hamlets were encircled by non-defensive
walls, which appear to be the remains of cattle-pens;
while in others each pen was connected with its own hut,
the walls forming a complex whole.<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> Many huts contain
cooking-holes, lined with stones, in some of which traces of
charcoal are found:<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> others had cooking-stones but no
holes:<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a> occasionally the kitchen was in the open air outside
the dwelling;<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a> and in a circle on Whit-Tor, where no
provision for cooking was discernible, there seemed to be
evidence that the hut had been simply the workshop of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
a flint implement maker.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> Many of the dwellings on
Dartmoor apparently consisted of only one room; while
others, like the single specimen on Ty Mawr, contained
partitions.<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> Some huts were paved, while others had no
visible means of excluding damp.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> The large size of many
of the Dartmoor circles has led antiquaries to believe that
they could not have carried roofs sufficiently strong to
withstand the snows and storms of winter, and were only
occupied in the summer by herdsmen;<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a> but in most parts
of England huts must have been inhabited throughout the
winter, whose roofs were constructed of nothing more
substantial than woodwork overlaid with sods or bracken.
It is remarkable that not a single bronze implement, weapon,
or ornament has ever been found in a hut-circle on Dartmoor,
although sufficient pottery of the Bronze Age type
remained to attest their age.<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a> Probably, like the people
who dwelt on the Yorkshire Wolds, the inhabitants were
poor and backward; for the extreme scarcity of spindle-whorls
and the abundance of the flint scrapers used for
leather-dressing that lay scattered in their abodes seem to
show that they were commonly clad in skins.<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg156" class="sidenote">Inhabited
camps.</div>

<p>On the borders of Wiltshire and Dorsetshire, and doubtless
also in other parts of Britain, small communities erected
earthworks for permanent occupation, which differed in
size, situation, and mode of construction from the great
hill-forts, but were nevertheless adapted to some extent
for defence. A considerable number of small entrenchments,
approximately square in outline, are scattered over
the downs in these two counties; and three of them&mdash;Martin
Down Camp, South Lodge Camp, and Handley Hill
Camp&mdash;have been thoroughly excavated. The results left
it doubtful whether the last-named had not been constructed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
in Roman times;<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> but the other two belonged
unmistakably to the Bronze Age. Martin Down Camp
covered about two acres; and South Lodge Camp only
three-quarters of an acre. The ramparts, which were very
low, were probably strengthened by stockades. Both camps
were situated not on the summits of hills but in sheltered
nooks, and were probably used as enclosures for cattle;
but an abundance of broken pottery, animal bones, and
burnt cooking flints proved that they had also been inhabited
by man.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a></p>

<p>But the evidence for describing the domestic life of our
Bronze Age is insignificant in comparison with that which
is afforded by the Swiss lake-dwellings. The most remarkable
British habitation of that time, indeed almost the only
one which can rival those of Switzerland in the richness
of its remains, is not a hut, not even an artificial shelter
of the poorest kind. In 1859 some quarrymen were removing
limestone from a ravine formed by the Stanhope Burn,
a tributary of the Wear, when they discovered the now
<span id="PI_CIV_Pg157" class="sidenote">The Heathery Burn Cave.</span>
far-famed Heathery Burn Cave. Antiquaries hurried to
the spot; and when a layer of stalagmite had been removed
relics began to be found. During thirteen years exploration
went on; and finally, besides the bones of the family who
had occupied the cave, those of the animals on which they
had fed, and the shells of mussels, cockles, and limpets,
a vast number of tools, weapons, utensils, and ornaments
were collected, which belonged to the closing period of the
Bronze Age. A pair of bronze tongs, unique in Britain,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
and one-half of a mould for casting socketed celts showed
that they had been independent of bronze founders; and
their outfit comprised two swords, seven spear-heads, nineteen
socketed axes, two chisels, three gouges, two socketed
knives, a tanged knife, a razor, two implements of deer’s
horn, three bone knives, a stone spindle-whorl and some
flint flakes, fifteen bronze and four bone pins, a bronze
cauldron, a gold bracelet, numerous penannular bronze
bracelets, including one which was so small that it must
have been worn by a little girl, eight large bronze bangles
evidently intended to be worn on the upper arm, six bronze
disks, whetstones, buttons, and other articles too numerous
to mention. Indeed the only bronze objects of any importance
which are not represented in the collection are daggers,
hammers, sickles, and shields.<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a> The cauldron, which is
shaped like a truncated cone with the broad end uppermost,
belongs to a class of vessels which were not made before
the close of the Bronze Age, and are exceedingly rare in
England, but not uncommon in Scotland and Ireland. It
closely resembles one which was dredged up from the bed
of the Thames near Battersea, and which may be seen in
the British Museum; and perhaps it may have come in the
course of trade from Etruria, where the type originated.<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
It had been used for cooking, and was associated with
numerous fragments of earthenware. The domestic pottery
of the Bronze Age, like the sepulchral vessels, was made
by hand,<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> and, unlike them, was fitted to endure rough
usage; but while the collection obtained from the cave
and nearly all the other examples that have been found
are unornamented, the table ware of Dartmoor hardly
differs from that which came from the barrows of the same
district and is as elaborately decorated.<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a> It is also remarkable
that many kinds of household utensils&mdash;bowls and
jars, pans and pannikins, cooking pots, pots for boiling
water or meal, pipkins, cups, and strainers&mdash;have been
discovered in barrows. Some, which were entire, had
apparently been deposited instead of regular sepulchral
vessels; but many were in fragments, and may have been
used in funeral feasts.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a></p>

<p>The exploration of the Heathery Burn Cave not only
illustrates the life of the Bronze Age; it also shows that
even in districts far remote from the Continent the use of
bronze was not confined to a conquering people but spread
to the descendants of the older population. The skeletons
in the cave were wholly different from the types which are
associated with the round barrows, and closely resembled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
those which have been recovered from the beds of rivers in
England and Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a></p>

<p>But what is most remarkable is the contrast between the
wealth of these cave-dwellers and the discomfort in which
they lived. Here was a family well armed, equipped with
the best tools of the time, owning flocks and herds, possessing
land which they cultivated, and rich enough to load
their women with ornaments, yet content to live in a dark
damp cavern traversed by a stream, which one night rose
in flood and drowned them in their sleep. It has been
suggested that they had huts in the neighbourhood, and
only resorted to the cave on extraordinary occasions.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a>
What could have induced them to live in it even for a day
is difficult to conceive; but that they inhabited it, if not
permanently, at least for long periods, is proved by the
abundance of pottery as well as by the heaps of refuse
which represented the remains of a long succession of meals.<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg160" class="sidenote">Dress.</div>

<p>The spindle-whorls of stone, bone, and baked clay which
have been found in this cave, in barrows,<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a> hut-circles, and
elsewhere, and hardly differ from those which, a few years
ago, were commonly used in Scottish villages and in many
parts of the Continent,<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a> are not the only relics that bear
witness to the development of dress during the Bronze Age.
The deer-horn implements which belonged to the cave-dwellers
and exactly resemble others that were obtained from
the sites of Swiss lake-dwellings, were probably used in
weaving.<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> Bone tweezers from barrows in Wiltshire and
Dorsetshire and bronze tweezers from Anglesey were perhaps
designed for drawing thread through holes in leather: but
they may also have been used for extracting superfluous
hairs;<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a> and the numerous razors<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> that have come to light,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
some of which have no parallel in any foreign country,
show that Britons, even in the furthest north, shaved their
beards many centuries before Caesar noticed the custom.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a>
Leathern garments, as we have seen, were largely worn:<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a>
indeed the remains of a stitched leathern dress have been
recovered from a barrow in Northumberland;<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> but more
interesting are pieces of the woollen
and linen clothes in which the dead
were sometimes buried.<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">652</a> Nor was
the apparel of the Bronze Age
devoid of ornament, or fastened
merely with thorns, like that of the
Germans of a far later period
<span id="PI_CIV_Pg161" class="sidenote">Pins and buttons.</span>
whom Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">653</a> described. Pins of
bone or bronze, some certainly
worn with dresses, others perhaps
in the hair, were not uncommon;
and we have seen how large a
store was possessed by a single
family.<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> Even the indigent people
of the Yorkshire Wolds wore buttons not only of stone,
bone, and wood, but of jet, some of which were beautifully
ornamented with the pattern of a Maltese cross.<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a>
During the earlier part of the Bronze Age buttons were
pierced on the under side with V-shaped holes, which
enabled them to be sewn on to the dress&mdash;a device which,
on the Continent, was inherited from the Stone Age; and,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
as far as can be judged from the skeletons with which they
are associated, they were used only by men. At a later
time the perforation was apparently superseded by a raised
loop, which is found on buttons of bronze.<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> In Wiltshire
and Norfolk chiefs actually adorned their tunics with
buttons of gold.<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a> Ivory buttons and ivory pins have been
unearthed in Wiltshire; and amber buttons were among
the ornaments not only of that rich district but of Norfolk
and even of Yorkshire and Dorsetshire.<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a> Nor were these
costly materials used only for personal adornment. A

bronze dagger with an ivory handle has been obtained
from a barrow near Bere Regis in Dorsetshire:<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">659</a> an archer’s
wrist-guard or bracer of bone, found at Kellythorpe in the

and from a barrow near Normanton in South Wiltshire
Hoare obtained a dagger with a wooden handle exquisitely
inlaid in a chevron pattern with thousands of golden rivets,
each smaller than the smallest pin. ‘It could not,’ he
wrote, ‘be surpassed (if, indeed, equalled) by the most
able workman of modern times.’<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a> With such a weapon
hanging at his side and his dress glittering with gold or
amber studs, a British chieftain must have made a splendid
show. But some were not content with such display.
Early in the last century a cairn was opened at Mold in
Flintshire, which was said by the peasants of the country-side
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
to be haunted by a ghost in golden armour. Three
hundred loads of stones were carted away; and then
appeared a skeleton, accompanied by three hundred amber
beads that had once formed a necklace, and a golden peytrel,
mounted on a copper plate, with which the owner had
decorated his horse’s breast.<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> This interment indeed
belonged to the very latest period of the Bronze Age; but
much earlier was the barrow of Upton Lovel in South
Wiltshire, which contained along with personal ornaments
<span id="PI_CIV_Pg163" class="sidenote">Ornaments.</span>
of gold an amber necklace of a thousand beads that had
been worn not by a woman but by a man.<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a></p>

<p>But although necklets and bracelets and other ornaments
were commonly worn by knights and Druids in Gaul, their
use in this country seems to have been generally restricted
to women; and, whatever the reason may have been, the
women of Britain, then as now, wore less jewellery than
those of foreign countries.<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a> Still, many specimens, most
of which belonged to late periods, are to be seen in the
museums which illustrate the culture of the Bronze Age;
but for the most part they were either imported or fashioned
after foreign designs.<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">666</a> Bronze ornaments are comparatively
rare<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> although, as we have seen, the family who lived
in the Heathery Burn Cave possessed many, and their
armlets are absolutely unique.<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">668</a> In Scotland as well as
in the wealthier parts of England women displayed gold
torques of various patterns, some plain, others penannular,
which resembled large bangles, others again funicular, of
twisted ribbon-like form, or wrought with a pattern like
the thread of a screw;<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">669</a> while gold bracelets in equal variety
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
clasped their wrists; and an ivory armlet has been found
in a Wiltshire barrow.<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> In 1863 a ploughman, guiding
his team at Mountfield in Sussex, turned up a hoard of gold
ornaments weighing eleven pounds.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">671</a> A hoard buried in
Elginshire contained no less than three dozen gold armlets,
belonging to the latest period of the Scottish Bronze Age;
and an armlet of twisted wires, made to encircle the arm in
four coils, which was considered the finest specimen of the
goldsmith’s art of this period ever found in Scotland, was
cut up and melted down by an Edinburgh jeweller.<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> The
most interesting, however, of all the Scottish gold ornaments
are the crescent-shaped lunettes, worn round the
neck, which were of Irish origin, and of which only four
English specimens are known.<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">673</a> They would seem to be
of early date; for two were found in association with a flat
celt.<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">674</a> Rings were extremely rare;<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> and ear-rings have only
been met with in Derbyshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire,
and the north of Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">676</a> A pair which was found in
a grave in Morayshire can only be described as hideous.
They were made of gold, in shape like an open shell or pod,
five inches and a half long, and suspended at right angles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
to the hook.<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a> Perhaps the most beautiful and characteristic
ornaments of the Bronze Age were the jet necklaces,
which were very common in Scotland and comparatively
rare in Southern Britain, though they were worn in Northumberland,
Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and on the Yorkshire
Wolds. They generally consisted of flat plates, adorned
with chevron or lozenge patterns, and strung together by
bugle-shaped beads.<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a> A similar necklace of quadrangular
amber tablets, connected by beads of the same material,
formed part of the treasures of a chieftain’s wife in Wiltshire,
and was deposited in one of the barrows at Lake,
near Stonehenge.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a> Amber was indeed the most fashionable
of all ornaments in this region, where it was worn sometimes
alone, sometimes in combination with jet and with
blue or green glass beads. In full dress, with one of these
necklaces hanging over her bosom, gold bracelets on her
arms, a pair of gold disks, bearing devices like a Greek cross,
on her dress, and pins of bronze, which shone like gold,
in her hair, a Wiltshire dame must have surpassed even her
husband in splendour.<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a></p>

<p>Those who could not afford such costly ornaments were
not always obliged to content themselves with perforated
boars’ teeth or bone beads; for, incredible as it may appear,
sham jewellery was in vogue even in the Bronze Age. Not
many years ago three penannular rings, picked up by a
ploughman near Forfar, were found to consist of bronze
coated with gold leaf.<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg167" class="sidenote">Distribution
of wealth:
sources of

<p>While these things help us to realize the circumstances
of the people who wore them, they also throw light upon
the distribution of wealth, and supplement the information
which we have already obtained from implements and
weapons about internal trade and foreign commerce.
Possibly some difference of burial customs may account
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
for the comparative abundance of gold ornaments in Scotland
and the almost entire absence of trinkets of any kind
in Cornwall; but the evidence is generally accepted which
seems to point to the conclusion that the inhabitants of
Wiltshire&mdash;especially of Salisbury Plain&mdash;were richer than
those of any other part of Southern Britain. The most
expensive ornaments&mdash;amber, gold, ivory, and glass&mdash;have
been found there in considerable numbers; and all of them
must have been imported, directly or indirectly, in some
cases from abroad. The glass beads, which, strictly speaking,
were made of vitreous paste, perhaps came from the Mediterranean;
and a blue one of real glass with yellow spirals,
taken from a Ross-shire barrow, had its counterparts in
the cemetery of Hallstatt.<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a> Where the ivory was procured
is doubtful: objects of this material, apparently made from
the fossilized tusks of a mammoth, lay among the relics
in the Paviland Cave in Glamorganshire;<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a> but most of the
mammoth tusks in this country are too decomposed to be
susceptible of manufacture.<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> Gold has been obtained from
most of the alluvial gravels in the West of England that
have been worked for tin;<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a> but many of the English and
perhaps all the Scottish gold ornaments were made of gold
that had been won in Ireland, which has been justly called
the El Dorado of the ancient world. Many gold ornaments
in Denmark are of Irish origin; and the leading archaeologist
of Scandinavia affirms that the metal-workers of his
own country and of France imported Irish gold.<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a> Amber
has been washed ashore at Deal and on other parts of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
east coast; and the necklaces of Wiltshire may perhaps
have been generally of British material as well as of British
workmanship:<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> but those of Ireland were probably made
from amber that had come from Scandinavia,<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a> and may
have been taken in exchange for gold. In the time of
Augustus amber was one of the British imports;<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a> and,
although at least one necklace found its way even to Orkney,<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">690</a>
its rarity in Scotland and in the northern counties of
England suggests that it was imported even in the Bronze
Age.<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> Indeed, since amber was so much commoner in
Wiltshire than elsewhere, it would seem probable that it
came generally from abroad.<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg169" class="sidenote">Why was
Wiltshire
exceptionally
rich
in ornaments?</div>

<p>But why was it so abundant in Wiltshire? Why are
gold, amber, and ivory rare even in the other southern
counties, and wholly absent in Derbyshire, where round
barrows are so numerous?<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">693</a> Why was the wealth of
Wiltshire, so far as it can be estimated from the evidence
of the graves, almost entirely concentrated in the south,
and especially in the district round Stonehenge?<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">694</a> The
modern population of South Wiltshire is very scanty:
Salisbury Plain is barren; and the only soil at all fertile
is in the valleys of the Wiley and the Avon.<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a> One would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
have expected to find that the wealthiest part of Britain
was the south-east; and that in the prehistoric period, as
in the time of Caesar, the richest of all was Kent. Yet
Kent has yielded very few glass beads or gold ornaments of
the Bronze Age, and not one of amber or ivory. Doubtless
there were once many barrows in the south-eastern counties
which have been rifled or ploughed down; but jewellery
was not deposited only in barrows; and so many bronze
tools and weapons have been found in this region that the
scarcity of barrows will not account for the rarity of ornaments.
No explanation, so far as I know, has ever been
offered; and I offer one with diffidence. First, it is not
certain, and indeed improbable, that more than a small
proportion of the riches that have been unearthed from the
sepulchres of South Wiltshire belonged to families who had
lived in the neighbourhood. The prodigious abundance of
barrows around Stonehenge can only be explained by
supposing that the bodies of chieftains, of their wives and
children, were brought from distant parts to be buried there,
as to a hallowed spot. Secondly, it is conceivable that the
clans which, early in the Bronze Age, settled in South
Wiltshire were numerically stronger, better organized, or
better armed than their neighbours, and that much of
their wealth may have been obtained by plunder.</p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg170" class="sidenote">British
trade and
the spiral.</div>

<p>Another indication of ancient British trade appears in
the geographical distribution of the spiral. This form of
decoration, which was common in Egyptian and Aegean
art, travelled along the route of the amber trade by the
Danube valley and Hungary to Scandinavia, and ultimately
reached the British Isles, where, however, it occurs only
on stone balls,<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> the stones of cists, and megalithic monuments,
of which the most conspicuous example is New Grange in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
the county Meath. The spiral is not found on objects of
the Bronze Age in Spain, nor in France except on the dolmen
of Gavr’ Inis in Brittany and in a grave in the department
of the Aube: in the British Isles it is confined to Scotland,
Cumberland, Lancashire, and Northumberland, the north of
Ireland,<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a> and Merionethshire (which may have owed its
solitary specimen to Irish influence); and, moreover, in
the British Isles and Scandinavia spirals are connected by
the same device.<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> Scandinavia therefore was undoubtedly
the source from which the spiral reached Britain.<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg171" class="sidenote">Comparative
backwardness
of culture
in Britain.</div>

<p>Yet while the reader who has been accustomed to suppose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
that the Britons even of Caesar’s time were mere savages
may be astonished to learn that already in the Bronze Age
there was commercial intercourse between Britain and the
Continent, he must beware of assuming that his forefathers
were on a level with the inhabitants of Central and Southern
Europe. Our country has long been the geographical centre
of the civilized world: in ancient times it was outside the
pale. Regular trade did not exist except with Northern
Gaul and, probably towards the end of the age, with Massilia
and Phoenician Spain:<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">700</a> such articles of commerce as found
their way to Britain from Central Europe were flotsam and
jetsam. Long after swords had come into use abroad the
Briton’s chief weapon was still a stout dagger: bronze was
used here for centuries after iron had been adopted in more
fortunate lands; and the glass beads of which the women
of Wiltshire were so proud would have been scorned by
foreign ladies who compared them with their own.<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">701</a> Moreover,
even in bronze our workmanship never reached the
pitch of excellence which the artificers of the north, in their
prolonged Bronze Age, were able to attain. Just as the
neolithic cutlers of Britain were inferior to those of Denmark,
so there is nothing in our museums which can vie with the
astonishing splendour of the decorated palstaves and shields,
the trumpets and vessels of the Scandinavian region.</p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg172" class="sidenote">The information
obtainable
from
graves.</div>

<p>But we shall be better able to understand the relations
that existed between our country and the Continent in the
Bronze Age when we have studied the graves, the objects
other than weapons, implements, and ornaments that have
been found within them, and the rude stone monuments
with which they were often associated.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg173" class="sidenote">Round
barrows,
cairns, and
sepulchral
circles.</div>

<p>We have seen that round barrows were already being
erected before the Bronze Age began, and that they were
used not only by the round-headed invaders but also by
the older population.<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> After the close of the Neolithic Age
no more long barrows were constructed,<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">703</a> although some of
those which existed were still used even under the Roman
occupation;<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">704</a> nor were the dead buried, except perhaps in
certain Cornish cairns,<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> in chambers which were intended to
be opened from time to time. Thenceforward the graves
were cists, commonly made of four stones set on edge, which
were closed by a fifth once for all after the corpse or burnt
bones had been laid within them;<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a> or, where no stones
could be obtained, holes scooped in the chalk,<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a> and sometimes
even hollowed trunks of trees or real coffins.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a> Occasionally,
however, the body, burnt or unburnt, was laid
upon the ground without anything to protect it from the
superincumbent mass.<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">709</a> When a tumulus was erected,
whether it was an earthen barrow or a cairn, its form was
usually round and occasionally oval. The change involved
degeneration.<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">710</a> Galleries were no longer required. The
chambered cairns of the north gave way to structureless
heaps of stone: the chambered long barrows of England
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
with their portals, entrance-passages, and graceful exterior
curves were succeeded by mere mounds.<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a></p>

<p>What would first impress an ordinary wayfarer is the vast
number of the round barrows compared with the rarity of those
of the older form. The mounds clustered in the immediate
neighbourhood of Stonehenge many times outnumber all the
long barrows in Britain. Three hundred still exist in an
area of twelve square miles; and from one spot hard by
the great stones Stukeley counted a hundred and twenty-eight.<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">712</a>
Again, while the long barrows almost always stand
on conspicuous hills, round barrows are sometimes placed
on low ground.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> In certain maritime districts, for instance
Cornwall and Brittany, it has been noticed that the
monuments of the dead are most thickly strewn in the
extreme west, as if the builders had desired that the spirits
of those who had gone before them might look upon the
setting sun.<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">714</a></p>

<p>The material, it need hardly be said, varied according to
the resources of the district. In Scotland, Wales, and
Cornwall cairns are almost universal, some being of gigantic
size. In 1876 a cairn in Fifeshire was opened; and after
more than a thousand cartloads of stones had been removed,
a solitary cist appeared, containing one interment.<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> Sometimes,
however, mounds of various kinds coexist in the same
region: thus in Devonshire we find round barrows, cairns,
and small central cairns covered by round barrows.<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a> In
other counties again barrows made of earth, of chalk, and
of earth and chalk mixed may be seen close together.<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">717</a>
Curiously enough many barrows on the Yorkshire Wolds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
were constructed of clay which had been fetched from
distant places.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a></p>

<p>Round barrows range in diameter from twenty to one
hundred and fifty feet; and while some are even now
twenty-four feet high, others barely rise above the level of
the surrounding ground.<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">719</a> Those of the oldest form, which,
however, continued to be erected contemporaneously with
others of later types, have some resemblance to a shallow
inverted bowl. More than three-fourths of the Wiltshire
barrows belong to this variety, which is also prevalent in
Yorkshire and almost invariable in Derbyshire, Dorsetshire,
Somersetshire and the Orkney Islands.<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">720</a> These mounds
are occasionally surrounded by shallow ditches, in which
cases they represent a transition to the form which is called
bell-shaped.<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">721</a> Barrows of the latter kind, which stand on
a flat area surrounded by a ditch, but not by a bank, and
are larger, steeper, and more conical than those of the
primitive form, are far more numerous in Wiltshire, and
especially round Stonehenge, than elsewhere; although
a few exist in other parts of Southern England, and some
of the so-called bowl barrows in the East Riding can hardly
be distinguished from them.<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">722</a> Latest of all were the disk-shaped
barrows,&mdash;small mounds standing alone, in pairs,
or in groups of three, within a circle defined by a ditch,
which is fenced on its outer side by a bank. Occasionally
the enclosure contains no mound at all, but only a grave
dug out of the chalk; on the other hand, in one instance the
whole area within the ditch is covered by a low mound.
Disk barrows are commonest near Stonehenge, and outside
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
Wiltshire they are hardly to be found except in the adjoining
corner of Dorsetshire, on the Cotswold Hills, in Sussex,
and, though rarely, in Derbyshire. As they contained ornaments
more frequently than the other kinds, it has been
supposed that they were specially devoted to the interment
of women;<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">723</a> but we may accept the explanation that, like
the barrows, the ornaments for the most part were comparatively
late.</p>

<p>The significance of the ditches and banks has puzzled
many antiquaries. There are barrows close to one another,
some of which are surrounded by ditches, while others have
none; while in districts in which stone is abundant there
are barrows enclosed by or enclosing small circles of stones,
and others which have neither one nor the other.<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">724</a> Perhaps
the barrows enclosed by circles are comparatively late, and
the stones may sometimes have been intended, wholly or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
in part, to give form and symmetry to the mound; for in
Derbyshire, where the barrows of the Bronze Age are really
cairns, a structural improvement was made by building
up the whole mound of concentric rings of stones.<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a> Again
in Wiltshire ditches and banks are invariably complete;<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">726</a>
whereas on the Yorkshire Wolds banks and ditches or circles
of stones are generally incomplete; and this characteristic,
which belonged, as we have seen, to certain long barrows,<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">727</a>
is repeated not only in megalithic circles in the British
Isles and in India, but also in rings which are carved on
rocks and on the covering stones of cists.<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a> It has been suggested
that the banks and stone circles were intended to
bar the exit of the dreaded spirits of the dead;<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">729</a> but if this
was the purpose of the builders, why did they leave the
barrier imperfect? It is possible that their motive was not
superstitious but utilitarian: the break may simply have
been a causeway intended to give access to the barrow.<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">730</a></p>

<p>Round barrows and cairns, like long barrows, are commonly
supposed to have been erected only as memorials of chiefs,
their relatives, and perhaps their honoured retainers;<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">731</a> for,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
it is said, no humble family would have had the needful
command of labour: but considering that in Wiltshire,
where there are more long barrows than in all the rest of
Britain, round barrows are thirty-four times as numerous,<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a>
it is difficult to accept this opinion. Many of the round
barrows are small; and it is surely probable that the poorer
clansmen sometimes voluntarily gave their services to provide
respected members of their own class with a distinctive
monument. Barrows and cairns, however, are not the only
sepulchres in which interments of the Bronze Age have been
discovered. A cave at Gop, near Rhyl, which had been
used as a dwelling, contained a sepulchral vault;<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> and
Rains Cave in the same county was used alternately as
a dwelling and a cemetery.<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">734</a> Many graves also exist over
which no mound was erected.<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a> Thus on Handley Down in
Dorsetshire no less than fifty-two interments of cremated
bones were found in holes dug out of the chalk on the
western side of a barrow. They were evidently later than
the funeral in the barrow itself, and were doubtless the
remains of the descendants or connexions of the chief who
had been buried there.<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a> In Scotland numerous cemeteries,
most of which were on knolls or sandhills, were unmarked
by any external sign;<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a> and at Elton, near Beverley, in the
East Riding, more than seventy bodies were interred without
a barrow.<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> It has been supposed that such graves belonged
to the poor and lowly; and doubtless where they occur in
large numbers and are almost or entirely devoid of accompanying
relics the assumption is justified.<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">739</a> In certain cases
also, where one or two large barrows are associated with
groups of tiny mounds, the latter were devoted to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
humbler members of the tribe. Two of the Scottish cemeteries,
however, contained gold armlets, others beautifully
ornamented bronze blades;<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">740</a> and three of the only four
graves in which Pitt-Rivers found the sepulchral vessels
which are known as drinking-cups lacked any memorial.<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">741</a>
These may have been the graves of men of rank; and so
may the simple stone cists, in which relics have been found
that would seem to have belonged to persons of some wealth;<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">742</a>
for while every cist that has been observed in Devonshire
either is or was once covered by a mound,<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">743</a> there are many
in Northumberland, as in Scotland, which were left without
any monument.<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">744</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most curious of all the burial grounds of the
Bronze Age is one which has been lately explored at Bleasdale
in Lancashire, and which may be compared with the
wooden chamber in the neolithic Wor Barrow on Cranborne
Chase.<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">745</a> Here, on a moorland knoll surrounded by
an amphitheatre of hills, is a circle made not of stones but
of wooden logs closely planted in a trench, and containing
a smaller circle, which consists of a bank with a ditch on
its inner side. Within this ditch is a low mound, concealing
another circle of logs, in the centre of which were found two
sepulchral urns. The ditch is floored with poles, which may
perhaps have been trodden by worshippers who walked in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
ceremonial procession around the grave; for the bottom of
a ditch surrounding a barrow near Blandford, which was
opened towards the end of the last century, was worn into
a smooth track by human feet.<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">746</a></p>

<p>Hardly less remarkable is a circle near Port Erin in the
Isle of Man, formed of eighteen cists, in six separate sets,
each composed of three arranged in the shape of the letter
T, two being placed end to end along the circumference,
while the third extended outwards at right angles.<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a></p>

<p>In Britain, as in other countries, cenotaphs were erected
in honour of the dead whose remains could not be found.
Barrows have been opened within which, after the most
careful scrutiny, not the faintest indication could be detected
of any burial, although in one there was an empty urn and
in another a small stone pavement, enclosed by a miniature
stone circle and resting upon burnt earth, which suggested
that an ideal cremation had been performed.<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a> It seems
possible that Silbury Hill was a monument of this sort.
This stupendous earthwork, which commands the Bath
road, six miles west of Marlborough, is one hundred and
thirty-five feet high and covers about five acres. The cost
of its erection at the present day would be not less than
twenty thousand pounds.<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a> In 1777 a shaft was sunk from
the top to the bottom; and in 1849 a tunnel was driven
from the side to the centre. No trace of burial was found:<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
but even primary interments were not always made at the
centre of a barrow; and the labour of proving, if it could
be proved, that Silbury Hill was not erected over a grave
would be out of all proportion with the result. At all events
its purpose was connected with sepulchral usage. Recent
excavations in the meadow west and north of the hill are
believed to have shown that it was originally surrounded
by a trench, which was filled with water; and a local
antiquary has suggested that the mound was an artificial
stronghold!<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">751</a> But what clan would have undertaken this
herculean labour in a district where every hill was suitable
for defence, and of what use would the mound have been
for such a purpose?</p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg181" class="sidenote">Chronology
of the
barrows.</div>

<p>The chronology of the barrows is somewhat perplexing.
There is hardly a single absolutely certain instance in which
a socketed celt, a sword, or a socketed spear-head has been
found in a barrow, associated with an interment;<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">752</a> and
most antiquaries infer that the round barrows generally
belong to the earliest period of the Bronze Age.<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">753</a> It would
follow that during not less than four or five centuries the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
practice of raising mounds over graves was discontinued,
and one could only wonder how it came to be revived at
the beginning of the Iron Age. It has indeed been argued
that the absence of swords is no proof that they were not
used when barrows were being erected, but merely shows
that it was not customary to bury costly weapons which
were not habitually worn.<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">754</a> It seems difficult, however, to
explain why a distinction should have been drawn between
swords and socketed celts, on the one hand, and knives,
daggers, and awls, which were often buried, on the other.<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">755</a>
Some may accept the suggestion that in the later period of
the Bronze Age, when cremation had presumably become
general, the practice of burying weapons or ornaments had
ceased;<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">756</a> but in the Early Iron Age it was not uncommon.<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">757</a>
It would seem, moreover, that in one or two instances
socketed weapons were laid with the dead;<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">758</a> and Dr. Arthur
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
Evans, pointing out that an amber necklace, found in one
of the barrows near Stonehenge, is identical in form and
arrangement with the amber necklaces of Hallstatt, boldly
affirms that the disk-shaped barrows of Wiltshire belong to
the end of the Bronze Age.<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">759</a> Be this, however, as it may,
it is morally certain that some of the glass beads which
abounded in the graves of South Wiltshire were contemporary
with socketed weapons; and a competent antiquary,
who has diligently examined their associations, concludes
that they belonged to the eighth and seventh centuries
before the Christian era.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">760</a> Moreover, an earthenware vessel
of the kind which are called incense-cups, found in a barrow
at Bulford, near Amesbury, was ornamented with concentric
circles;<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> and, as we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">762</a> this form of decoration,
which is common on the covering stones of cists in Scotland
and in the north of England,<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">763</a> is also characteristic of socketed
celts and unknown on implements of earlier date. The
number of celts which have been found in barrows is so
small that it would be premature to lay stress upon the fact
that only one belonged to the socketed type;<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">764</a> and there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
may have been some reason, of which we are ignorant, for
the absence of spear-heads and swords. In Gaul, at all
events, relics belonging to every phase of the bronze culture
have been exhumed from burial mounds.<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">765</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg184" class="sidenote">Cremation
and inhumation.</div>

<p>In the Bronze Age, as in the period of the long barrows,
both cremation and inhumation were practised in Britain.
In Cleveland and on the coast between Scarborough and
Whitby cremation was almost invariable:<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">766</a> in Northumberland
nearly twice as common as inhumation.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">767</a> In Derbyshire,<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">768</a>
on the other hand, inhumation interments are slightly
commoner than those by cremation; and on the Yorkshire
Wolds more than three times as numerous.<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">769</a> In Wiltshire
and Dorsetshire inhumation is as rare as cremation on
the Wolds; and in Gloucestershire, Devonshire, Cornwall,
Merioneth, Carnarvon, and Denbigh cremation is practically
universal.<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">770</a> In Devonshire interments by inhumation
have been found, but never in barrows.<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">771</a> In Scotland the
numbers are about equal.<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">772</a></p>

<p>Archaeologists generally hold that cremation was not
practised in the Bronze Age until a comparatively late date,&mdash;probably
not before 1000 <small>B.C.</small>; and this view seems at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
first sight to be supported by the facts that it was unknown
in Scandinavia in the earlier period;<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">773</a> that cinerary urns were
not the earliest of the sepulchral vessels; and that drinking-cups,
which were in use before any of the others, although
they continued to be used after cinerary urns had been
introduced,<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">774</a> are generally found with unburnt skeletons,
and have never been found with the cremation interments
in Cleveland.<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">775</a> On the other hand, in Brittany in the centuries
which immediately followed the introduction of metallurgy
cremation was almost invariable;<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">776</a> burnt bones, as we shall
presently see, were often buried without urns; and since
cremation was not uncommon in the Neolithic Age, the
custom probably persisted into the Bronze Age independently
of its introduction by immigrants who possessed weapons
of bronze. Indeed, unless cremation existed from the very
beginning of the Round Barrow period, it seems impossible
to account for the fact that in the sepulchres of certain
districts not a single instance of inhumation has ever been
observed. Before the inhabitants of Bute emerged from
their Stone Age they practised both cremation and inhumation;
and there is no evidence that the latter was earlier
than the former.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">777</a> Not infrequently both in Scotland and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
in many parts of England skeletons and burnt bones reposed
under the same cairn, in the same barrow, within the same
stone circle, even in the same cist; and in some cases they
were buried at the same time.<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">778</a> A cairn has been opened
at Greenhill in Fifeshire, in which four different modes of
sepulture had been practised: cremated remains had been
laid in the earth, and beneath a stone slab; an unburnt
body had been buried in a cist, and another lowered into
a pit.<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">779</a> In some barrows one unburnt body has been found
accompanied by several deposits of burnt bones; and it
has been inferred that, even after cremation had become
general, the bodies of chieftains were very rarely burned,
although those of their wives and retainers were.<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">780</a> It is
possible that this distinction may sometimes and in some
places have been maintained; but obviously it was very
unusual. For otherwise we should be compelled to suppose
that in Cleveland and in those western districts in which
cremation was universal no chiefs were buried in barrows
at all, although it is universally admitted that it was in
their honour that barrows were erected. And if the presence
of an unburnt body surrounded by urns is a sign that wife
and dependents were sacrificed in honour of the dead chief,
what conclusion is to be based upon the association of nine
skeletons with a single cremated interment?<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">781</a> On the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
Yorkshire Wolds the question as to which method should
be adopted had nothing to do either with rank or sex or age;<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">782</a>
and one may reasonably suppose that it was often settled
simply by individual preference. Moreover, the expense of
cremation was far greater than that of inhumation;<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> and it
is not improbable that long after the former had become
prevalent among the wealthy the poor were generally obliged
to content themselves with the latter.</p>

<p>Inhumation was accompanied by many varieties of usage.
Most of the Wiltshire barrows contained only one interment,
though in a few&mdash;evidently family tombs&mdash;there were two
or even more.<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">784</a> Those of the Yorkshire Wolds, on the other
hand, generally contained several, two or three having
sometimes been laid in one grave; and where one only
was found the barrow was of the conical kind which is
common in Wiltshire.<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">785</a> In the Scottish cists also, single
burial is the rule, though occasionally husband and wife
were interred together, and sometimes a father with his
child.<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">786</a> The same variety has been noticed in connexion
with cremation: a group of eight barrows in Lincolnshire
contained one urn each, while inside a barrow in Dorsetshire
was found a cairn which covered nearly fifty interments.<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">787</a>
When a mound was erected, the primary interment
was generally made in the centre.<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">788</a> The body was almost
always laid in the crouched position. In Wiltshire this
custom was absolutely, and on the Yorkshire Wolds almost,
universal: the same posture indeed was commonly adopted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
there even when the body was cremated.<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">789</a> In Dorsetshire,
on the other hand, the extended position appears to have
been occasionally met with.<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">790</a> When secondary interments
have been found, they were generally on the surface of the
barrow or just outside it, and were covered with fresh
material.<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">791</a> There is a barrow on Lord’s Down in Dorsetshire,
formed of alternate layers of mould and chalk, which represent
no less than five successive interments, each of which
was covered by a new tumulus.<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">792</a> Almost invariably on the
Wolds secondary interments were made on the southern
or eastern side of the mound, doubtless in order that the
dead might face the sun; and this fancy underlies the prejudice,
which still exists, against burying on the northern side
of a churchyard.<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">793</a> Probably the same purpose is discernible
in the orientation of the skeletons. Generally in Wiltshire
they were laid with their heads towards the north so that
they looked southwards;<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">794</a> and although in Yorkshire and
elsewhere the head has been found directed to almost every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
point of the compass, yet, as a general rule, it was so laid
as to face the sun: thus when it pointed westward or to
the north or south of west, the body was commonly laid
upon its right side; when to the east or the adjacent points,
upon the left.<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">795</a></p>

<p>It is probable that bodies were generally interred either
in the clothes which had been worn in life or in a winding-sheet;
for at Kelleythorpe in the East Riding a linen cloth
was underlying a skeleton: bones have been found in divers
parts of Britain with fragments of woollen or leathern
fabrics clinging to them; and buttons in their natural positions
on the breast-bone.<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">796</a> In one instance Hoare found
a skeleton in a disk-barrow near Amesbury, lying on the
ground, without cist, grave, or coffin, beneath a heap of
stones, and quaintly suggested that the dead man had
suffered the doom of Achan.<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">797</a> Occasionally, however, corpses
were not buried entire; but, as in the Stone Age, the bones
were disjointed and interred separately.<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">798</a></p>

<p>When the dead were cremated the customs which governed
the disposal of primary and secondary interments remained
the same: indeed in the Lord’s Down barrow the latter
comprised both skeletons and burnt bones. The mound
was sometimes raised over the funeral pile; but more commonly
the ashes were brought to the place of interment.<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">799</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
Although they were often enclosed in urns, this custom was
by no means universal. In the disk-shaped barrows of Wiltshire,
in which cremation was almost invariable, urns were
very rare: the remains had generally been wrapped in
a skin or a linen cloth.<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">800</a> In Dorsetshire, on the other hand,
except in the north-eastern corner, the customs of which
closely resembled those of Wiltshire, urns were used three
times out of four;<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">801</a> while some barrows have been opened
which contained both urns enclosing burnt bones and burnt
bones without any urn.<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">802</a> Occasionally an urn has been found
which, instead of containing the bones, was surrounded by
them.<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">803</a> Sometimes the urn was placed upright; but much
oftener, at least in Wiltshire, it was inverted;<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">804</a> and occasionally
one urn was inverted as a cover over another.<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">805</a> In
more than one instance a custom described by Homer had
found its way to Britain: the urn which contained the
ashes of Patroclus was wrapped in a cloth;<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">806</a> and in a barrow
in Cambridgeshire, as well as in six of those which Hoare
opened, the same ritual was observed.<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">807</a> In several Scottish
graves tiny urns, containing the remains of infants, were
placed inside vessels of ordinary size;<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">808</a> and it is remarkable
that in a few instances empty cinerary urns have been found
in association with unburnt bodies.<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">809</a> Why urns were sometimes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
broken into fragments before they were placed in the
grave it would be vain to guess.<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">810</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg191" class="sidenote">Sepulchral
pottery.</div>

<p>The urns and drinking-cups which have been so often
mentioned were not the only kinds of sepulchral pottery.
Besides them were bowls which have been called food-vessels
and incense-cups. The custom of placing vessels in
graves was not, however, universal: both in Wiltshire and
in Yorkshire the majority of interments were without them.<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">811</a>
All four kinds are worth studying, not only as illustrative of
funeral customs, but also because they throw light upon
the origin of the round-headed invaders and upon the
intercourse which subsisted in the Bronze Age between
Britain and other lands.<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">812</a></p>

<p>Like the domestic pottery of the same period and of the
modern inhabitants of the Hebrides, they were generally
made by women: the markings, produced by the impression
of finger-tips and finger-nails, with which they were often ornamented,
were the work of small hands.<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">813</a> The potter’s wheel,
which, more than two thousand years before the Christian
era, was used in Hissarlik, the town on whose site Troy was
afterwards built, was as yet hardly known in Britain,<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">814</a> and
the British pottery of the Bronze Age was baked at open fires.<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">815</a></p>

<p>Although they all comprise numerous varieties, the four
groups are so distinct that an observant eye, after an hour
spent in a well-stored museum, or even after studying the
illustrations alone, would be able, in almost every instance,
to assign this or that specimen to its proper class. Drinking-cups
are generally about seven or eight inches high, and fall
under three principal types. That which is apparently the
earliest and, in Southern Britain, by far the commonest, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
globular in its lower part, and rises from the waist into
a high brim with straight sides. In cups of the second
class an oval body passes into a brim which curves outward.
The third
kind, almost all
the examples of
which belong to
Northumberland
and Scotland, and
which, from its
accompaniments,
would seem to
have been the
latest, is also
somewhat oval in
the lower part,
and has a very low
and more or less
straight brim. A
few high-brimmed
cups have handles,
and are not unlike
modern tankards.
Drinking-cups in
general are the
handsomest and the most skilfully baked of all the British
sepulchral vessels; but in course of time their forms gradually
deteriorated, for each generation had inferior models to copy.<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">816</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_33" src="images/fig_33.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span> ½</p></div>

<p>Food-vessels, which range between three and eight inches
in height, are
very diversified
in form,
and, unlike
drinking-cups,
vary greatly in
quality. They
commonly resemble
a large
cup or bowl
with a narrow
bottom, and
sometimes
they are
slightly contracted towards the mouth. Many of them have
knobs round the neck,
which are sometimes
perforated, so that they
might have been suspended
by a cord; and
those which have no
perforations are doubtless
mere survivals.<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">817</a></p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="fig_34" src="images/fig_34.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span> ½</p></div>

<p>Cinerary urns, which
were certainly introduced
later than food-vessels
or drinking-cups,
are as a rule much
larger, although one or
two have been found
which were as small as
the smallest incense-cup.
Many of them are more than two feet high. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
commonest form resembles a double truncated cone with
the base in the centre, the upper being much the smaller of
the two; but some urns are cylindrical, barrel-shaped, or
even like flower-pots; while a few, which are peculiar to
central Dorsetshire, are nearly globular, and, except for the
scantiness of their ornament, not unlike certain drinking-cups.<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a></p>

<p>Incense-cups are the smallest, perhaps the latest of
all sepulchral vessels,
and the most
various in form.
Some contract from
the centre towards
the top and the
bottom; others expand,
others again
contract from the
bottom to the top.
A few resemble
saucers in shape; and many are perforated with oval,
lozenge-shaped, or vertical holes, one example having as
many as twenty-seven.<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">819</a></p>

<p>Drinking-cups have been found on the Continent not only
in Germany, Gelderland, and Denmark, from which countries,
it should seem, they were introduced into Britain,
but also in Spain, Portugal, Brittany, and the Channel
Islands.<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">820</a> On the Continent they all belong to the Neolithic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Age; and this fact alone is sufficient to show that the
people who brought them into Britain had no bronze
implements.<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">821</a> Moreover, although they continued in use in
this country during a considerable part of the Bronze Age,
they have rarely been found with bronze.<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">822</a> Only two specimens
have been obtained in Ireland,<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">823</a> an additional indication
of the erroneousness of the theory which identifies the
earliest round-headed invaders who introduced drinking-cups
into Britain with the Goidelic Celts. Like food-vessels,
drinking-cups were receptacles for solid food or perhaps
some kind of porridge; for remains which have been proved
by analysis to be animal or vegetable have been found in
both.<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">824</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

<p>Food-vessels are unknown outside the British Isles, and
are frequent in Ireland,<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">825</a> while hardly a single specimen has
been found in any of the numerous barrows of Wiltshire or
Dorsetshire.<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">826</a> Like drinking-cups, they accompany skeletons
far more frequently than burnt bones;<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">827</a> and they were
obviously invented after drinking-cups had been some time
in use, though, as it would seem, while incense-cups were
still unknown.<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">828</a></p>

<p>Incense-cups, like food-vessels, are common in Ireland
as well as in Britain: a few have been found in the Channel
Islands; but on the Continent they do not exist. They, too,
are rare in Dorsetshire and the western counties,<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">829</a> although
cremation was even more prevalent there than in Wiltshire,
where they are numerous, and although they have hardly
ever been found except with cremated remains.<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">830</a> It is
remarkable that they were often deposited inside the urn
and among the burnt bones.<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">831</a> The purpose for which they
were designed has been a subject of much controversy.
It is difficult to believe that they were really censers, for
incense was probably not obtainable in Britain, though
amber, which has occasionally been used as incense, may possibly
have been burned in them. The numerous holes with
which so many of them are pierced, and which would have
stimulated combustion, might suggest that they were
intended to carry the sacred fire from which the funeral pile
was to be lighted; but as many specimens contain no holes
it is impossible to acquiesce in this explanation.<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">832</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>All these vessels were ornamented with the geometrical
decoration characteristic of the Bronze Age, which consists
for the most part of combinations of straight lines, arranged
in almost infinite variety&mdash;chevrons, zigzags, lozenges, and
the herring-bone pattern&mdash;as well as dots and what have
been called oblong punch marks, and, in a few cases, crosses,
curves, and even circles. The patterns were impressed upon
the clay while it was still wet by a pointed implement of
bone or wood, by cords, and occasionally, as we have seen,
by finger-nails or finger-tips. Some of them may have been
imitated from basket-work or from the plaited straw or
grass with which the fragile vessels were protected; for
Pitt-Rivers found on his estate a fragment of fine basket-work
over which clay had been plastered on both sides. As
a general rule drinking-cups and food-vessels are far more
profusely ornamented than the other kinds, both being in
many cases covered with decoration.<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">833</a> Except perhaps in
the case of drinking-cups, it is doubtful whether any useful
conclusion can be drawn from the patterns; for, although
the oblong punch marks are apparently peculiar to the
British Isles,<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">834</a> chevrons of divers kinds have been found in
nearly every country of Europe, as well as Africa, Madagascar,
Siberia, Ceylon, the Philippine Islands, and North Australia.<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">835</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
Indeed one form of chevron ornament&mdash;the so-called diaper
pattern&mdash;appears not only on French neolithic pottery and
on urns from a chambered cairn in Orkney, but also on
a palaeolithic implement from Brassempouy;<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">836</a> and the rude
hand-made bowls out of which the modern Hebrideans eat
their porridge are still ornamented, as they were three
thousand years ago, with straight lines made with a pointed
stick or with impressions of a thumb-nail.<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">837</a> On the other
hand, as chevron patterns characterized the Bronze Age
throughout Europe, although they occurred both earlier
and later, further research may ultimately show that they
had a common origin.<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">838</a> The supposition that concentric
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
circles&mdash;a form of ornament which, as we have seen, is also
characteristic of the shields of the Bronze Age&mdash;were generally
symbolical of sun-worship,<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">839</a> is hardly likely to be proved.
Probably in some cases they had this or some other religious
meaning: but in others they may have been purely decorative;
and they are to be seen on the <i>churingas</i> or sacred
stones of the Aruntas of Central Australia,<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">840</a> who, it need
hardly be said, do not worship the sun. More interesting
are the few vessels which bear incised designs inlaid with
white earth, and resemble, though in a ruder style, pottery
from the lake-dwellings of Switzerland and Austria and from
Hissarlik.<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">841</a> It is conceivable that this kind of decoration
may have arisen independently in the different lands in
which it has been observed: but the most sceptical would
hardly deny the evidence of indirect connexion with the
Aegean which has been furnished by the famous chalk

‘drums’ of Folkton Wold. Associated with the body of
a child in a trench which partially surrounded the barrow
were three solid drum-shaped cylinders of chalk, decorated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
not only with familiar geometrical designs, but also with
concentric circles, which in one case seemed to be degenerate
spirals, figures called ‘double horse-shoes’, which occur at
New Grange and at Gavr’ Inis in Brittany, and quaint
representations of the eyes and eyebrows of the human face,
closely resembling the so-called owl-heads which Schliemann
found on vases at Hissarlik. Similar faces are sculptured
on standing stones and the walls of sepulchral grottoes in the
departments of
the Marne, the
Gard, and the
Tarn, and incised
on Spanish
pottery of
the early
Bronze Age;
and probably
it was by way
of Spain that
this Mediterranean

found
its way to a
remote Yorkshire

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg200" class="sidenote">Sepulchral
evidence
as to religion.</div>

<p>We have already examined the evidence which the
articles deposited in graves afford as to the wealth and
social condition of the people who were buried there. They
also suggest problems connected with their religious faith.
The custom of depositing implements, weapons, or ornaments
with the dead was the exception rather than the
rule. Less than one-fourth of the interments in the
Yorkshire Wolds were associated with any article whatever;
and even in South Wiltshire barely two-thirds. In Derbyshire
and Scotland relics were comparatively frequent, but
by no means universal; in Cornwall almost entirely absent.<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">843</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
When we find that daggers were often placed in the hands
of corpses<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">844</a> and that nearly all the flint tools on the Wolds
were brand-new,<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">845</a> we may be disposed to reject the theory
that the motive of those who deposited them was simple
affection or superstitious dread of using what had belonged
to the living; but when, on the other hand, we remember
that so many of the dead were left destitute, we ask ourselves
whether the articles that were placed in graves were really
intended to be used in a future state.<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">846</a> But it is a mistake
to expect either uniformity of custom or rigid consistency.
Different tribes and different individuals may well have
had different beliefs; and it is not likely that belief was
always translated into action. Articles that belonged to
the living have sometimes been buried from mere motives
of affection or from a wish to get rid of that which was
associated with the idea of death; sometimes from a vague
desire to please or to avoid the displeasure of the dead.<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">847</a>
Often, however, as we learn not only from historians, such
as Caesar<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">848</a> and Tacitus,<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">849</a> but also from the evidence that
has been collected respecting the customs of savage tribes,
objects have been deposited with the dead in the full expectation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
that their souls would be of use to the souls of
their owners in another life;<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">850</a> and when not inanimate
objects only but wives, slaves, and animals have been sacrificed,
it may be safely assumed that this was the motive.
Nor is the belief absolutely extinct even in civilized lands.
Less than half a century ago the widow of an Ulster farmer
killed his horse, and, in reply to a remonstrance, asked,
‘Would you have my man go about on foot in the next
world?’<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">851</a> All these motives may have worked in the Bronze
Age. We have seen that offerings of food were placed in
food-vessels and drinking-cups; and they may sometimes
have been laid beside the dead even when no vessels contained
them. The bones of domestic animals, deer, and
wild boars which have been found in scores of barrows,
and most of which had been pounded for the extraction
of the marrow, were doubtless in many cases the remains
of the food upon which the survivors had feasted, but perhaps
also of food offered to the dead.<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> It is possible too that
the burnt bones which are sometimes mixed with cremated
human bones may be the remains of animals sacrificed at
the funeral, and may represent the custom, described by
Homer<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">853</a> and Caesar,<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">854</a> of slaying animals of which the dead
had been fond and burning them on the funeral pile;<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">855</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
and when we are told that the skulls of oxen were carefully
interred in several barrows and that a horse was
buried near the summit of a barrow in Wiltshire above a
cremated interment,<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">856</a> we are tempted to accept a similar
explanation. We can understand why implements and
weapons were often placed inside urns along with the burnt
bones;<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">857</a> but it would be vain to ask why a cow’s tooth
was frequently placed in juxtaposition with a corpse;<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">858</a>
and who would venture to account for the presence of the
burnt bones of a fox inside an urn in a barrow on Ridgeway
Hill in Dorsetshire, of the skeleton of a mole and
the bones of mice in an urn in Glamorganshire, or of the
skeleton of a hog in a cist in a Staffordshire barrow?<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">859</a>
We can only suppose that these mysterious deposits had
some religious meaning.</p>

<p>But whether animals were sacrificed or not, there can
hardly be a doubt of the prevalence of human sacrifice.
It has been pointed out that several bodies were frequently
interred in one barrow at the same time; that in some cases
a man and a woman were laid in one grave or in adjoining
graves of the same date; and that in a barrow overlooking
the valley of the Derwent a woman was buried with a man
whose head her hands clasped, while his legs were above
hers and his right hand upon her hip; and of these facts
one finds it difficult to suggest any explanation save that of
sacrifice or of suicide.<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">860</a> The innumerable potsherds which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
lay scattered in many barrows when they were first opened,
and the minute flint chips with which cinerary urns were
sometimes crammed<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">861</a> remind one of the words in <cite>Hamlet</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">For charitable prayers</span>
<span class="i0">Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her,</span>
</div></div>

<p>though we should be mistaken if we supposed that in the
Bronze Age such offerings were made in the spirit which
animated the ‘churlish priest’ who grudged decent burial
to Ophelia.<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">862</a></p>

<p>A distinguished archaeologist has argued that not only
in Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean but also in Gaul
and Britain inhumation and cremation were associated with
different conceptions of a future life; the ghost of the body
which was interred being regarded as tenanting the grave,
whereas, when cremation was practised, the soul was supposed
to take flight to Hades or to some far land, though
it could not enter the confines until the body which it had
quitted was duly burned.<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">863</a> But whatever the Mycenaeans
and the Greeks may have believed, there is no reason to
suppose that in the West cremation was attended with any
such doctrinal change. We have seen that both in the Neolithic
Age and after, cremation and inhumation were practised
contemporaneously and sometimes even in the same
grave;<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">864</a> and recent excavations have shown that in the
caves of Mentone, even in the Old Stone Age, the two modes
of sepulture were in use.<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">865</a> If the Celts of the Early Iron Age
believed that ‘on the burning of the body the soul departed
to a distant region’, there is no proof that their belief
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
was different when they laid the body in the grave; and who
will maintain that the religious ideas of the Gauls were
revolutionized when in the second century before Christ
cremation once more became the rule, or that among the
Britons of Caesar’s time cremation and inhumation, which
had each their votaries, were the outward signs of religious
beliefs that were utterly unlike?<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">866</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg205" class="sidenote">Engraved
stones.</div>

<p>We may perhaps hope to find other clues to the religious
ideas of the Bronze Age in megalithic monuments and
in the engraved stones which have been already mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">867</a>
There are certain designs upon the latter of which the
meaning is evident. The figure of an axe graven on a cist
at Kilmartin in Argyllshire has many analogues on dolmens
in the Morbihan and on the walls of artificial sepulchral
grottoes in the department of the Marne; and, as the axe
in the Mycenaean Age was a symbol of Zeus, we may suppose
that such engravings represented a widespread cult of
one of the most fruitful of human inventions, which originated
in neolithic times, and survived in the manufacture of miniature
celts to serve as pendants and, still later, in the use of
stone celts as amulets.<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">868</a> The most common devices, however,
are small circular depressions, called cup-markings,
and concentric circles; while occasionally groups of concentric
circles are united by grooves. Cup and ring markings
are found on the stones of cists, on standing stones, on
boulders, and on rocks in most parts of Scotland, in
Carnarvonshire and Merionethshire, in Northumberland,
Cumberland, Westmorland, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Man,
Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Dorsetshire, and Cornwall, and
likewise in Ireland, France, Germany, Switzerland, Portugal,
Scandinavia, Asia, Africa, and America.<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">869</a> Natural cup-markings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
have been noticed on the covering-stones of certain
dolmens;<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">870</a> and it may be that such stones were deemed lucky
and that, when they could not be obtained, they were
imitated; but of those which are artificial the significance
remains unknown.<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">871</a> The rings may perhaps in some instances
be symbolical of sun-worship, for on the cairn of
Lough Crew in Ireland and in Scandinavia a few have
rays;<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">872</a> and since we find them on the covering-stones of
cists, while in Australia similar designs, drawn on rocks,
are magical or sacred,<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">873</a> it would seem probable that they had
some religious meaning.<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">874</a> Sun-worship undoubtedly prevailed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
<span id="PI_CIV_Pg207a" class="sidenote">Sun-worship.</span>
in certain parts of the British Isles. A few years
ago there was found in Zeeland a gold-plated bronze disk,
engraved with concentric circles and mounted on a miniature
car with the model of a horse attached, which was
recognized by all archaeologists as a votive object, connected
with the worship of the sun. Similar disks, two of which
are ornamented with a cruciform pattern&mdash;a well-known
solar symbol&mdash;have been exhumed in Ireland, and a fragment
of one in a barrow near Bath.<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">875</a> Besides the spirals
which have been already mentioned, the most remarkable
of all the rock-carvings is a swastika on a rock near Ilkley,
identical with one which has been discovered in Sweden,
not far north of Gothenburg: the oldest known examples
of this mystical figure come from the second city that was
built upon the site of Troy.<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">876</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg207b" class="sidenote">Stone
circles
and other
megalithic
monuments.</div>

<p>We have seen that many barrows and cairns were immediately
surrounded by, or enclosed, rings of standing stones
which were part of the sepulchral structure. It is now time
to consider the larger stone circles and other megalithic
monuments which have occasioned voluminous controversies.
They were not invented in the Bronze Age; for,
as we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">877</a> some of the long barrows were surrounded
by peristaliths: the famous circle of Callernish in the island
of Lewis contains a chambered cairn, from which it is
structurally distinct;<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">878</a> and some of our circles which are
apparently non-sepulchral may have been set up in transitional
times. But the development of the circle, which
can be traced most clearly in Scotland, was gradual. In
the chambered cairns and chambered long barrows the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
peristalith as a rule was merely an adjunct: in many
unchambered cairns and round barrows the stone setting
is still a subordinate part of the whole; but, gradually
separating itself, it became the leading feature of the monument,
while the central cairn or barrow frequently disappeared,
and was replaced by a simple cist.<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">879</a> By similar
stages the encircling trenches and banks in Wiltshire and
Oxfordshire became distinct from the small disk barrows
which they contained.<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">880</a></p>

<p>Stone circles are to be seen in the northern counties of
England, in Derbyshire and Staffordshire, Shropshire and
Cheshire, Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Dorsetshire,
Devonshire, Somersetshire, and Cornwall; and also
in Glamorganshire, Orkney, the islands of Arran and Lewis,
Argyllshire, Perthshire, Inverness-shire, Banffshire, Aberdeenshire,
and Kincardineshire.<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">881</a> Menhirs, or isolated standing
stones, and stone rows are found in this island only
on Dartmoor, in Cornwall, Northumberland, Scotland,
and Wales.<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">882</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>In form as well as in size British stone circles present
numerous varieties.<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">883</a> It would, however, be useless, at all
events until circles of every kind had been excavated, to
attempt to account for their distinctive features; and it
is significant that, although various districts have types of
their own, there are examples of divers kinds in close
proximity.<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">884</a> Many were simple rings. Some consisted of
concentric rings; and here and there small circles, each of
which was outside the others, were enclosed within a greater.
Sometimes the stones were set up in close proximity; sometimes
in open order.<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">885</a> Among circles of the latter kind
Stonehenge, Avebury, and Callernish were approached by
stone avenues,<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">886</a> the existence of which has been tentatively
explained by the supposition that originally the spaces
between the stones of the circle were filled by walls intended
to keep out beasts.<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> A few circles are surrounded by
ditches, which were spanned by causeways; others by
both ditches and banks; and it is noteworthy that at
Avebury the ditch lies within the bank, while at Stonehenge
in the same county it surrounds it.<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">888</a> In many circles
of Banffshire, Kincardineshire, and Aberdeenshire, there
is a recumbent stone, placed intentionally in that position,&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
feature which appears to be elsewhere unknown:<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">889</a>
a few in Aberdeenshire have a solitary pillar in the centre;<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">890</a>
while Stonehenge, the Rollright Stones in the Cotswold
Hills, and some Scottish circles are distinguished by a
similar stone which stands outside.<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">891</a></p>

<p>The imaginative Stukeley, whose teaching is still echoed
in many handbooks, regarded stone circles as Druidical
temples; and although nearly every modern antiquary
feels bound to ridicule this theory, none can prove that it
does not contain a kernel of truth. Druids presided at all
religious ceremonies;<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">892</a> and it would be rash to deny that
in stone circles religion had any part. The foremost archaeologist
of France has virtually sanctioned the discredited
theory;<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">893</a> and if there is any truth in the view, which still
has respectable advocates, that some circles were solar
temples, Druids may well have directed the worshippers.
It has been contended that many circles were orientated
to the place of the midsummer sunrise, and that the presence
of the solitary outlying stones would be inexplicable
unless they were set up as pointers. These monoliths,
however, are very rare: some are in positions which cannot
be reconciled with any theory of sun-worship; and when
they are absent and there is no avenue, it is clearly impossible
to prove that the circle was orientated at all.<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">894</a>
It is true that the existence of an interment within a circle
no more proves that it was not a temple than the graves in
Poets’ Corner prove that Westminster Abbey is not a
church: but the most enthusiastic advocates are forced
to admit that many circles show no trace of orientation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
and the evidence upon which they rely is sometimes of the
flimsiest kind.<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">895</a> The one statement which can be positively
made about the object of stone circles is that very many of
them were erected in honour of the dead. Many enclose
cairns or barrows: many others contained human remains,
almost always cremated, in cists.<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">896</a> Stone circles are associated
with sepulchres not only in Britain but in Scandinavia,
Northern Germany, France, Spain, Italy, North Africa,
Syria, and India, indeed in every country in which they
exist.<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">897</a> It is true that in many English circles evidence of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
such association is lacking;<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">898</a> but we may doubt whether
in any case its absence has been absolutely proved; and if
the excavations had been directed by an antiquary as
wealthy and as diligent as Pitt-Rivers, it might have been
forthcoming.<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">899</a> But supposing that there are circles in which
no burial ever took place, it does not follow that they were
unconnected with sepulchral usage: like the empty barrows
which, as we have seen, are cenotaphs, they may have
been erected in honour of brave men who had fallen in battle
or of some chief whose body could not be recovered. Nor
are circles the only megalithic monuments the object of
which was sepulchral. The menhirs of France are often
grouped with dolmens and burial mounds;<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">900</a> and there
is not a single stone row or avenue on Dartmoor which is
not associated with cairns, barrows, or cists.<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">901</a> One, which
is more than two miles long&mdash;longer than any in Brittany&mdash;links
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
a circle to a cairn, and was perhaps designed to perpetuate
the memory of two ancestors who had done great
deeds.<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">902</a></p>

<p>Perhaps among the many superstitions about these
monuments which have survived into modern times there
are some that recall the purpose for which they were designed.
When Camden wrote, the Rollright Stones were
still regarded as petrified men; and it has been suggested
that the belief pointed to a time when popular imagination
‘transferred to the stone that marked the resting-place of
the departed something of his very material being’.<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">903</a></p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg213" class="sidenote">Stonehenge.</div>

<p>But of all the megalithic circles of our island one only
is familiar, even by name, to us all. Stonehenge is the most
famous and in its artlessness the most artistic of all rude
stone monuments. Even those who have never visited
it are acquainted with its form; and the imagination of
Turner has caught the spirit of the scene. The grandeur
of Stonehenge does not depend upon size: in its best days
it bore much the same relation to Avebury as the Sainte
Chapelle to the cathedral of Notre Dame; but, weather-worn
and mutilated, with many of its stones fallen and
others gone, it impresses all who are sensitive to nobility
of design as the creation of a master mind. When the
work was finished, if indeed it was not left incomplete,
the outer circle probably formed a continuous architrave,
all the stones supporting imposts, whose ends were wrought
into bosses that rested in hollows prepared for their reception.
Within was an incomplete circle of smaller stones,
which in their turn surrounded five great trilithons, disposed
in the form of a horse-shoe, of which two only remain.
They have analogues in Tripoli and in Syria; but in this
island they are unique.<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">904</a> On their inner side was a similar
group of lesser stones; and within this choir lies a vast
block, which is known as the Altar Stone.<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">905</a> From the north-eastern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
point of the trench that surrounds the rampart
an avenue, flanked on either side by a bank and a shallow
ditch, may still be traced for some four hundred yards;
and on it stands the huge pillar called the Friar’s Heel.</p>

<p>A portion of the area of Stonehenge has recently been
excavated; and more than a hundred of the rude tools
have been recovered with which the stones were dressed.
It was proved that the great sandstone boulders, commonly
called sarsens, had been roughly trimmed where they were
found on Salisbury Plain; for the fragments that were
found by the excavators were very few.<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">906</a> After they had
been carried to the place where they now stand<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">907</a> they were
dressed with a skill which shows how far superior the masons
were to those who had set up the rough blocks of Avebury.
Each pillar was gradually uplifted by levers until it could
slide down the sloping rim of the pit which the workers
with their deer-horn picks had excavated, and of which
the other three walls were vertical: then it was hoisted by
ropes till it stood upright, and finally secured by a packing
of smaller stones which supported it below. It is thus that
megaliths are commonly erected in Japan to this day.<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">908</a>
How the huge imposts were elevated is somewhat doubtful.
The Khasis shove theirs up an earthen bank.<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">909</a> In Japan
the stone is raised at one end by wooden levers, logs being
inserted beneath it: the other end is raised by the same
means; and thus by slow degrees the proper level is attained,
when the stone is forced on to its supports.<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">910</a> Once it was
thought that the ‘blue-stones’ of which the inner circle
is composed had been fetched from Cornwall or Dartmoor,<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">911</a>
or oversea from Ireland; but the geologist who was consulted
after the excavation inferred from the vast number
of angular chips which were discovered within the small
area of operations that the stones had been not only dressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
but also chipped into shape by the site of Stonehenge;
and one can hardly believe that if it had been necessary to
carry them from afar, the builders would not have reduced
their weight by rough-hewing them where they were found.<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">912</a></p>

<p>Stonehenge has a literature of its own which comprises
nearly a thousand works. It has been assigned to the
Neolithic Age, to the Bronze Age, to the era of Roman
dominion, and to a time when the Saxons had been long
settled in Wessex. Many years ago Pitt-Rivers pointed
out the only way in which these controversies could be
closed; but unfortunately the recent excavation was
confined to a small area. It only proved that the use of
copper was not unknown in Wiltshire when the stones
were set up; for on one of the sarsens, seven feet below
the surface, was found a stain produced by contact either
with copper or bronze. Deer-horn picks were commonly
used in the Bronze Age, and bronze tools are useless for
working stone; therefore the stone implements which the
excavations brought to light leave the question of date
unsettled. The absence of bronze implements is of course
no proof that the monument belonged to the Stone Age;
not a single article of bronze was found in twenty-four
barrows of Rushmore in South Wiltshire, every one of which
was erected when bronze was common.<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">913</a> Moreover, with
hardly an exception, every primary interment that has
been found within a megalithic circle in Britain was made
in the Age of Bronze.<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">914</a> All antiquaries agree that of all the
British circles Stonehenge was the most elaborate; and
the natural conclusion is that it was one of the latest of
them all. Two barrows are encroached upon and partially
surrounded by the rampart, which must therefore be of
later date; and chippings of both sarsens and blue-stones
were found by Hoare in one of the surrounding barrows
along with a bronze dagger and a bronze pin. On the other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
hand this discovery proves that Stonehenge existed before
the period of the barrows, not one of which is later than the
Bronze Age, came to an end.</p>

<p>Nevertheless a distinguished astronomer, who has been a
President of the British Association, recently assigned a
date to Stonehenge with which these facts are irreconcilable;
and although his theory was demolished by a brother
astronomer, he has not hesitated to republish it. Stonehenge,
he insists, was originally built a thousand years
before the trilithons were added; and the trilithons represent
a reconstruction and a re-dedication, which took place
about sixteen hundred and eighty years before the birth
of Christ. His chronological argument rests upon the
assumption that Stonehenge was a temple, consecrated,
at its hypothetical second dedication, to the cult of the
solstitial sun. Remarking that the avenue extends in the
general direction of the sunrise at the summer solstice, he
attempted to determine its azimuth. Unhappily the bearing
was not everywhere the same. He took the mean, and found
that it nearly coincided with a line drawn from the principal
bench mark of the Ordnance Survey on Sidbury Hill, the
site of an ancient fort, to the centre of Stonehenge. Although
there was no evidence that the erection of Stonehenge
had the remotest connexion with Sidbury Hill,
although the hill itself is not visible from Stonehenge, he
found it convenient to discard his own calculation of the
azimuth of the avenue and to adopt instead the bearing of
the bench mark. Then, making the further assumption
that the sun-worshippers adopted as the moment of sunrise
the time when the upper tip of the sun first appeared
above Sidbury Hill&mdash;a phenomenon which is very rare&mdash;he
ascertained from the rate of change in the obliquity
of the ecliptic that it would have been there visible about
sixteen hundred and eighty years before the Christian era;
or perhaps two centuries earlier or later. Nor did his
assumptions end here. Although the Alexandrian astronomer
who constructed the Julian calendar miscalculated
the date of the summer solstice, he assumed that sixteen
centuries earlier the barbarous inhabitants of a northern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
island could tell it exactly; and he assumed that, in order
to observe the sunrise, they stood at the exact point within
the circle at which it was convenient to him to place them.<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">915</a></p>

<p>But such laborious puerilities will not trouble the unlearned
wayfarer who feels the enchantment of the past.
For him it is enough that Stonehenge was the work of men
who felt the majesty of death, and for whom no toil was too
great that could do honour to the dead. Chronology has little
interest for him: whether Stonehenge was built to hallow the
vast necropolis in which it stands, or the dead were brought
from afar to lie beneath its shadow, he knows that the three
hundred barrows and the great monument are indissolubly
connected. The moment when he descried the grey weather-beaten
stones on the lonely Wiltshire upland will not fade
from his mind. Above the south horizon appeared the
slender spire of Salisbury; and the work of the Middle
Age and of the Age of Bronze awakened emotions of the
same kind: for both were erected in obedience to the
thought that man cannot live by bread alone. It may be
that those who set up the circle thought differently from
the believers who thronged it in later times: the cult of
ancestors, the worship of the sun, the adoration of the Celtic
deity who was the counterpart of Zeus may have called
successive generations of pilgrims to the holy place. Passing
beneath the trilithons and among the prostrate stones, one
thinks of all that has been done and suffered since mason
and digger worked side by side to execute the nameless
architect’s design. Time-honoured even when the Roman
first landed on our shore, Stonehenge was standing in all
its glory when the Greek explorer came who first made
known our island to the civilized world.</p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg217" class="sidenote">The voyage
of
Pytheas.</div>

<p>It was about the time when the conquests of Alexander
the Great were revealing the far east to the eager curiosity
of the Greeks that Pytheas set forth from Massilia on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
peaceful voyage which was to bring Northern Europe
within their ken. Such knowledge of Gaul and Britain
as had already reached the Mediterranean was of the vaguest
kind.<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">916</a> It has indeed been argued that the Greek word for
tin, <i>cassiteros</i>, which occurs in Homer, was of Celtic origin,
and was learned by the Greeks from traders who as early
as the ninth century before the Christian era procured tin
from Cornwall.<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">917</a> If this conjecture were accepted, it would
suggest that the existence of an island somewhere in the
far northern ocean was at that time known to a few dwellers
in the south. It has also been supposed that the lines in
the <cite>Odyssey</cite> which describe the country of the Laestrygones,
where the summer nights were short, were founded upon
stories told by sailors who had seen the British Isles;<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">918</a>
but the passage seems more applicable to Scandinavia,
which, owing to the amber trade, was from an early period
of the Bronze Age connected with South-Eastern Europe.
The knowledge that tin was to be got from Cornwall must,
however, have reached the Mediterranean at a remote epoch
through the ties that connected Britain with Gaul. Himilco,
the Carthaginian admiral who, more than a century before
the birth of Pytheas, sailed into the English Channel,
perhaps undertook his voyage for the purpose of opening
up trade with Cornwall at a time when the tin mines of
Galicia were nearly exhausted; but it is unlikely that his
report, upon which the poem of Festus Avienus was ultimately
based, was originally known except to his own
government.<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">919</a> In the time of Pytheas, however, there was
a regular overland trade in tin between Cornwall and
Massilia, and doubtless also a seaborne trade between Cornwall
and the Carthaginian port of Cadiz.<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">920</a></p>

<p>Pytheas was a great man. As an explorer he was the
forerunner of Columbus; and it is not easy for us, who
live in an age when hardly any part of the earth’s surface,
except the polar regions, remains untrodden, to conceive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
the animation with which his narrative was discussed by
his Greek contemporaries and by the geographers of a later
time.<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">921</a> His scientific eminence is attested by the use which
was made of his writings by Eratosthenes, the Alexandrian
geographer and poet, and by Hipparchus, the greatest
astronomer of the ancient world.<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">922</a> With a gnomon which
he erected in his native town he obtained an estimate of
its latitude which erred by no more than a few seconds;<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">923</a>
the observations which he made in the Atlantic enabled
him to announce that the height of the tides had a definite
relation to the moon’s age;<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">924</a> he determined with some
approach to accuracy the configuration both of Gaul and
Britain;<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">925</a> and at four stations in or near our island he
took observations of the altitude of the sun at noon, from
which Hipparchus calculated their respective latitudes.<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">926</a>
Unfortunately the work ‘On the Ocean’, which he based
on the diary of his voyage,<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">927</a> has perished. All that we
know of it is contained in a few fragments, quoted with
more or less accuracy by the astronomer Geminus, who
was contemporary with Caesar, by Strabo, Diodorus
Siculus, Pliny, and other writers.<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">928</a> Strabo, influenced by
the unimaginative mind of Polybius, was bitterly hostile;<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">929</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
and his treatise on geography taught many generations of
readers to regard Pytheas as a romancer.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that the Government of Massilia,
jealous of the commercial predominance of the Carthaginians,
and hoping to wrest from them a share of the trade
in tin, employed Pytheas as their agent. But the Massiliots
already received a constant supply of tin directly from the
British mines; and it is hardly credible that they could
have expected to profit by importing it oversea round
Spain instead of overland.<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">930</a> Nor indeed could they have
expected the Carthaginians, who were all-powerful at sea,
to allow their vessels to penetrate into waters which they
jealously policed. Polybius, who was affluent, sneeringly
remarked that a private individual, in poor circumstances,
could not have travelled such distances as Pytheas claimed
to have done.<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">931</a> It is no longer necessary to prove that
Pytheas’s travels were real; but, supposing that he could
not afford to pay his own expenses, we can only conclude
that the Massilian Government, or perhaps a syndicate of
merchants, were sufficiently public-spirited to spend money
on scientific aims. For although it would seem probable
from his having extended his voyage to the amber districts
that his object was partly commercial, the fact that he
sailed far away from the trade routes, and spent a large
part of his time in collecting ethnographical information
and making astronomical and geographical observations
shows that his own purpose was the advancement of science.
It is unnecessary to refute the quaint suggestion that
poverty compelled him to work his passage on board a
Carthaginian merchantman:<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">932</a> Carthaginian ship-owners
would hardly have permitted a captain to circumnavigate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
Britain in order to gratify the whim of an alien scientist
in the forecastle. If anything that relates to the voyage
of Pytheas is certain, it is that he was free to direct the
movements of the vessel as he pleased.<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">933</a></p>

<p>The outward voyage, even before he first saw the British
coast, was full of interest. After passing Cape Finisterre,
he steered eastward along the northern coast of Spain,
and found that, owing to the set of the current and the
prevailing westerly winds, the rate of sailing was much
more rapid than along the southern side of the Peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">934</a>
He touched at Corbilo, a port on the estuary of the Loire,
where British tin was unshipped; noted the great bend which
the Breton coast makes towards the north-west; and
found in the peninsula the same tribe of Osismii whom
Caesar encountered nearly three centuries later in his
campaign against the Veneti. Having visited Uxisama, the
modern Ushant, he struck thence along the course followed
by the Phoenicians, and in twenty-four hours crossed the
western arm of the Channel and landed near Belerium, the
Land’s End.<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">935</a> He conversed freely with the inhabitants,
doubtless through the medium of an interpreter, and found
them friendly and comparatively civilized. They told him
that the tin was cast into ingots, shaped like ankle-bones,
two of which would form a suitable load for a pack-horse,
and conveyed to an island off the Cornish coast, called Ictis,
which was accessible at low tide to their wagons. There
<span id="PI_CIV_Pg221" class="sidenote">Ictis.</span>
it was shipped and carried to Corbilo; and thence it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
transported on horseback to the mouth of the Rhone. The
whereabouts of Ictis has long been a subject of dispute.
It has been identified with St. Michael’s Mount, with the
Isle of Wight, and even with the Isle of Thanet. This
guess has, however, been discarded,<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">936</a> and no longer needs
refutation. It has recently been shown that a natural
causeway, formed by a limestone reef, connected in prehistoric
times the coast off Lymington with Yarmouth.
But this does not prove that Ictis was the Isle of Wight;
nor does the fact, on which much stress has been laid, that
coins of a certain type are common to Brittany, the Channel
Islands, and the south-western districts of Britain. Doubtless
much traffic passed by way of the Channel Islands,
but not necessarily that which Pytheas described; and
the Dumnonii, who produced the tin, never struck coins
at all.<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">937</a> We are told that in those days St. Michael’s Mount
was an isolated rock begirt by a swampy wood; and that
the voyage from Cornwall to the mouth of the Loire would
have been too long and dangerous for ancient seamen to
attempt. The former argument, in so far as it leans upon
tradition, was demolished forty years ago; the legend that
St. Michael’s Mount was ‘The Hoar Rock in the Wood’
was based upon a mediaeval story which confounded St.
Michael’s Mount with Mont St. Michel. It is true that
the eminent geologist who has proved the former existence
of a causeway between the Isle of Wight and the mainland
has attempted to reinforce tradition by science; but his
calculations, which assume that alluvium was dispersed by
marine action at a constant rate, seem hardly less liable
to error than the discredited estimates of the antiquity of
man which were based upon assumptions regarding the
rate of deposition of stalagmite in caves.<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">938</a> Nor would any
one who knows that long before the time of Pytheas men
were not afraid to sail from Norway to Ireland, that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
distance between Rome and Sardinia is greater than the
greatest breadth of the English Channel, and that before
the invention of the compass Irish monks made the voyage
to Iceland, believe that the Phoenicians or the Veneti in
their stout ships were too timid to cross from Cornwall to
the Loire. It is not credible that shrewd merchants would
have submitted to pay the heavy additional price which
would have been exacted if the tin had been conveyed
two hundred miles by land before it was shipped, and then
to saddle themselves with the cost of conveying it by sea
from the Isle of Wight to the Loire,&mdash;a voyage much longer
and not less dangerous than the direct route from Cornwall.
St. Michael’s Mount is the one island off the south coast of
Britain between the Land’s End and the Isle of Wight
which corresponds with Diodorus’s description; it is
opposite the only part of the Cornish coast where wagons
could have descended to the shore; and Pengelly, Lyell,
and Ussher testify that its main features have persisted
unchanged for more than two thousand years.<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">939</a></p>

<p>As far as the Land’s End the route of Pytheas is evident:
thenceforward all becomes obscure. We know that he
circumnavigated Britain; for he mentioned the South
Foreland and alluded to the northern extremity of Scotland,
and he attempted to estimate the circumference of the
island.<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">940</a> We know that he explored the amber coast, and
some conjecture that he sailed to ‘far-off Thule’; but it
is safe to prophesy that on the details of his itinerary
agreement will never be reached. He accurately indicated
the position of Ireland, which Eratosthenes, guided by his
observations, placed west of Britain, but which, Strabo
notwithstanding insisted, was the most northerly of all
inhabited lands.<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">941</a> It would seem that he landed more than
once; for he had much to tell of the manners and customs
of the Britons. He was especially struck by the gloominess
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
of the climate; the corn, he remarked, was not threshed
on open threshing-floors on account of the heavy rains and
the lack of sunshine, but the ears were cut off, carried into
barns, and there ground; and he learned that the grain
was not merely used for food, but also for brewing a kind
of beer. In the far northern districts he observed that
domestic animals were few, that the fruits of more favoured
lands were not to be seen, and that the only cereal was
oats.<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">942</a> According to Pliny,<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">943</a> he stated that the tide rose in
one place to the prodigious height of eighty cubits, or about
one hundred and twenty feet. It has been supposed that
this passage refers to the race of the current through the
Pentland Firth;<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">944</a> but more probably Pytheas had seen the
tidal wave in the Bristol Channel, which actually rises
sixty feet;<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">945</a> and it must remain doubtful whether he
exaggerated its volume or Pliny misrepresented his meaning.</p>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg224" class="sidenote">‘Ultima
Thule.’</div>

<p>The voyage which Pytheas made to the amber coast has
no place in the history of Britain; but we cannot but be
interested in his account of Thule, which he called the most

whether he even saw it.<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">947</a> He says that it was six days’
sail from Britain;<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">948</a> but this statement may have been
made upon the authority of natives<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">949</a> who had conversed
with Scandinavian mariners on their way to or from Ireland.
His description of the manners and customs of the northern
peoples, of their agriculture, their domestic animals, and
their food is reproduced by Strabo in a paragraph so vague
that one cannot be sure whether it was intended to refer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
only to Britain, or to Thule as well.<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">950</a> Strabo, if he had
any clear notion on the subject, must have applied it to
Britain, for Thule was in his eyes a mythical land;<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">951</a> but
if Pytheas was thinking of Thule, his account may have
been based upon hearsay. He described it as situated on
or near the Arctic Circle,<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">952</a> and since he called it an island,
his description, if he sailed thither himself, can only refer
to Iceland: but Iceland, when the Northmen took possession
of it, was found uninhabited except by a few monks;<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">953</a>
and it may be that he simply drew his own conclusions
from the reports of Britons who told him that in Thule
there was one night every year on which the sun never
set.<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">954</a> Again, when he said that Thule was near the frozen
ocean,<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">955</a> he may only have reported what he had heard;
though it is unlikely that the natives of North Britain
would have made a statement so misleading about any of
the Shetlands, which were within a few hours’ sail of their
own land. But perhaps we may find a clue in a well-known
passage in Geminus’s <cite>Elements of Astronomy</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">956</a> ‘The
natives,’ said Pytheas, according to this extract, ‘pointed
out to us the sleeping-place of the sun; for in these parts
the nights were very short, in some only two, in others
three hours long, so that the sun re-appeared soon after it
had set.’ Even in the Shetlands the duration of the shortest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
night is about five hours; but Cosmas Indicopleustes,<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">957</a>
a traveller and geographer of the sixth century, affirms
that the natives explained ‘the sleeping-place of the sun’
as the place where for twenty-four hours there was unbroken
darkness. We may well conceive how Pytheas stood talking
to Shetlanders or to people who lived near Cape Wrath,
while they pointed in the direction of Norway, in the
remoter parts of which, as they had learned from Norwegian
sailors, was to be seen the midnight sun, and at
midwinter there was for twenty-four hours continuous
night. But Pytheas would not have told this tale if he
had himself watched the sun above the horizon throughout
the midsummer night; nor would he have placed Thule
on the Arctic Circle if he had not believed that such a
spectacle was there to be seen. For the Romans of the
Empire Thule, as the northernmost of the British Isles,
was Mainland, which Agricola visited.<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">958</a> But on the whole
it seems most probable that Pytheas described it from
hearsay;<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">959</a> that he was misled into believing it to be in the
British archipelago; and that the Thule to which his
informants pointed was the Scandinavian peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">960</a>

<div id="PI_CIV_Pg227" class="sidenote">Pytheas
and the
ethnology
of Britain.</div>

<p>But, apart from the deeds of Pytheas himself, perhaps
the most interesting information which we owe to the
fragmentary record of his voyage relates to the ethnology
of Britain. He learned that it was called the Pretanic
Island. Before his time the Gauls for the most part had
come to change the original sound <i>qu</i> into <i>p</i>; whereas
certain tribes of Western Gaul<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">961</a> as well as all those Celtic-speaking
inhabitants of the British Isles from whose dialect
Gaelic, Irish, and Manx have been evolved retained it,
though the latter afterwards modified it into <i>c</i>. On the
other hand, wherever the Indo-European tongue from which
Celtic was an offshoot had the sound of <i>p</i>, most of the
Celtic-speaking tribes both of Britain and Gaul had let it
disappear. The word <i>Pretanic</i> therefore implied the existence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
of an earlier word <i>Qrtanic</i>; and supposing that
Pytheas, as some believe, heard <i>Pretanic</i> only in Gaul, it
might be argued that <i>Qrtanic</i> was still the British pronunciation.
If so, none of the tribes who had changed <i>qu</i>
into <i>p</i>, from whose dialect Welsh, Cornish, and Breton
descended, and who are commonly called Brythons, had
yet invaded Britain. But if, as seems much more probable,
Pytheas derived his information from Britons, the Brythons
were already predominant at all events in those parts of
Britain in which he conversed with them. Indeed, as we
shall afterwards see,<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">962</a> it is morally certain that Brythonic
tribes had been settled here at least half a century before
he came.</p>

<p>The subject of the ethnology of the Celtic-speaking tribes
of Britain is extremely difficult; and on nearly every
important point Celtic philologists differ widely among
themselves. It is almost an article of faith that the earlier
Celtic invaders were Goidels, or tribes who had not changed
<i>qu</i> into <i>p</i>; but there are some who maintain that neither
in the time of Pytheas nor even in that of Caesar were there
any Goidels in Britain; and that those who were settled in
Wales in the third century of our era were all of Irish origin.
No direct evidence indeed can be adduced for the common
view; but it is hard to conceive that the earliest Celtic
immigrants, unless they set out from Spain or from North-Western
Gaul, should have passed by Britain in order to
settle in Ireland. Even those who admit the priority of
the Goidels in Britain are not of one mind. While the
foremost Celtic scholar of this country maintains that when
Celts first reached Britain the distinction between the
Goidelic and Brythonic dialects already existed, the foremost
Celtic scholar of France insists that at that time the
Celtic language was everywhere the same: according to
him none of the Celts had then changed <i>qu</i> into <i>p</i>: that
change was made later by Celtic conquerors of Gaul, some
of whose descendants afterwards colonized Britain; and
the people with whom Pytheas conversed were not, strictly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
speaking, Goidels, but simply Celts who spoke a language
from which the Goidelic dialects&mdash;Gaelic, Manx, and Irish&mdash;were
subsequently evolved.</p>

<p>On its chronological no less than on its ethnological side
the Celtic question is involved in obscurity. History,
archaeology, and physical anthropology can give the philologists
little aid. The slender historical evidence does not
warrant us in assigning the earliest Celtic invasion of Britain
to a period more than six or seven centuries before the
Christian era. Philologists who, a few years ago, acquiesced
in this date, now put it back three centuries or more without
troubling themselves to give a reason. The Hallstatt period
of culture, which, in its earlier stage, coincided on the
Continent with the transition from the use of bronze to
that of iron, is believed to have lasted in Gaul from about
800 to about 400 <small>B.C.</small> As it is all but entirely unrepresented
in this country by iron weapons, one might perhaps
argue that Celts invaded Britain before iron implements of
Hallstatt type began to be common in Gaul; but this date
gives us no help, for it certainly was not earlier than the
sixth century before Christ.<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">963</a> Assuming that Goidelic and
Brythonic were distinct dialects before the Celts invaded
Britain, there is no evidence that the Goidelic invaders
(if they existed) were physically different from their Brythonic
kinsmen; and if they were, the fact would throw
no light upon the Goidelic invasion. For, as we have seen,
even if the period of the round barrows lasted to the end
of the Bronze Age, cremation, which destroys evidence of
physical type, was then in vogue. Therefore we must rest
satisfied with the probability that at some time after the
earlier period of the British Bronze Age tribes began to
invade Britain who spoke a language from which the Gaelic
that we know was descended; and with the certainty that
when Pytheas landed on our shore he found Brythons
already in possession.<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">964</a>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg231" class="sidenote">Iron probably
introduced
into
Britain by
Gallic
invaders.</div>

<p>Iron-working was of course familiar to the people of
the Mediterranean and even to the continental Celts long
before it was introduced into Britain;<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">966</a> but, it need scarcely
be said, everywhere until the Middle Ages, the metal was
not cast, but only wrought. Not far from Hallstatt, the
only place in Europe where the gradual transition from
the use of bronze to that of iron can be traced, were the
iron mines of Noreia, which were certainly worked at a very
early period, and from which, some archaeologists still
insist, the use of iron spread to all European lands.<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">967</a> Since
iron tools and weapons of the later Hallstatt type, ranging
from about the beginning of the sixth to the end of the
fifth century before the Christian era, are almost entirely
wanting in Britain, the earliest products of our Iron Age can
hardly be older than the later of these dates. Were they
introduced by immigrants or in the ordinary course of
trade? Among the round barrows on the Yorkshire Wolds
are two, situated in the parish of Cowlam, each of which
contained the skeleton of a woman. The appearance of
these mounds was not different from that of many others,
most of which belonged to the Bronze Age and a few perhaps
to that of stone: the skeletons were interred in the contracted
position which had been common for many centuries;
and the pottery exactly resembled the domestic
pottery which is associated with bronze. The practised
explorer who opened the barrows confessed that but for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
the presence of a brooch and certain ornaments of the Iron
Age he would unhesitatingly have assigned them to the
older period; and he accordingly concluded that no new
people had come in with iron.<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">968</a> But the conclusion is not
warranted except perhaps for the particular district to
which these graves belong. The use of iron might have
spread by barter to Yorkshire after it had been introduced
by new-comers into lands nearer Gaul; and the prevalent
opinion is that it was introduced about the beginning of
the fourth century before Christ by Gallic invaders who
spoke a Brythonic dialect.<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">969</a></p>

<p>Caesar knew nothing of any Gallic invaders of Britain
except the Belgae, who, as he gathered, inhabited the
maritime districts, evidently of the south-east and south:
the people of the interior, according to his informants, were
aborigines. This statement, however, made no distinction
between the real aborigines and the round-headed immigrants
who found them in possession. It is impossible to
say certainly which of the tribes in Caesar’s time were
Belgic, except the Belgae, the Catuvellauni, and the Atrebates,
none of whom possessed territory north of the basin
of the Thames;<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">970</a> but the names of tribes and of places
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
mentioned by Ptolemy and other late writers show that the
greater part of England and Wales and at least a considerable
part of Southern Scotland were in the first century
of the Roman occupation inhabited by Brythons; and
it is morally certain that they did not arrive after Caesar’s
departure. Evidently, therefore, the Belgae had been
preceded by other Brythons. But when did the first
Belgic invaders appear? Those who are not content to
take on trust the widely different dates which have been
assigned by archaeologists will find that it is impossible
to achieve any definite result. Dr. Arthur Evans has at
different times conjectured that the invasion began about
two hundred,<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">971</a> about one hundred and fifty,<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">972</a> and about
three hundred years before the birth of Christ.<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">973</a> It would
appear, however, from the time that must have been required
for the gradual evolution of the successive types of
British coins which will be noticed hereafter, that the prototype
was introduced not less than a century and a half,
possibly two centuries, before the Christian era; but it is
impossible to prove, though it is generally assumed, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
money was coined by the first Belgic invaders. The date
of the commencement of the earlier Brythonic invasion is
equally uncertain. It is now provisionally fixed about
400 <small>B.C.</small><a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">974</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg234" class="sidenote">Ethnology
of the
invaders.</div>

<p>Classical writers are practically unanimous in describing
Celts as a tall stalwart people with fair or red hair; and
physical anthropology confirms the general accuracy of
their statements. But this science shows that the Celts,
Goidelic and Brythonic, who successively invaded Gaul
were mixed themselves, and that the population whom they
found there were composed of two intermingled elements&mdash;a
small dark people who resembled the older neolithic inhabitants
of our own islands, and a short sturdy people, also dark
but round-skulled, who began to enter Gaul in the Neolithic
Age. Doubtless the Belgae as well as the earlier Brythonic
invaders of Britain were an amalgam of all these elements,
the tall red Celts whose ancestors had introduced the Celtic
language into Gaul being the most conspicuous. But it
is remarkable that although Strabo emphasizes the great
stature of the Britons, such sepulchral evidence as we possess
does not bear out his description. The skeletons of the Early
Iron Age that have been exhumed in Britain are mainly
those of small or middle-sized men, who to an untrained eye
seem hardly distinguishable from the neolithic race, but
whose skulls, although they too are long and narrow, generally
differ from theirs in the sight of an expert. Even the
skeletons that have been found interred with war-chariots
are unlike those of the cemeteries of North-Eastern Gaul.
Unfortunately the chariot-burials of Britain are very few:
many of the later British interments of the Early Iron Age
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
were made by cremation; and it can only be concluded that
the evidence which might have enabled us to recognize the
Celtic conquerors of the classical type has perished or has
not yet come to light.<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">975</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg235" class="sidenote">The order
in which
the various
tribes
arrived
unknown.</div>

<p>Attempts, based upon the geographical positions of the
various Brythonic tribes, as they were defined by Caesar,
Ptolemy, and other ancient writers, have been made to determine
the order in which they arrived. Thus it has been
supposed that the Britanni, coming from the country near
the mouth of the Somme, crossed the Straits and took possession
of Kent; that the Atrebates sailed up Southampton
Water and pushed inland till they reached those parts of
Hampshire and Berkshire in which they were afterwards
found; that the Trinovantes, who in Caesar’s time occupied
Essex, steered for the mouth of the Thames; that the
Catuvellauni, arriving a little later, were obliged to move
higher up the valley and content themselves with parts of
Middlesex, Hertfordshire, and Oxfordshire; that the Eceni,
whose settlements were in East Anglia, came later still;
and after them the Coritani, who dwelled beyond the Wash,
the Parisi, who seized the region of the Humber, and the
Brigantes, who held the greater part of Yorkshire and
Durham. The Cornavii of Cheshire and Derbyshire, whose
name seems to mean the inhabitants of the horn or peninsula,
are accordingly assumed to have landed between the
Mersey and the Dee. Last of all, we are told, came the
Votadini, who took to themselves the tract between the
Tyne and the Firth of Forth.<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">976</a></p>

<p>It would be surprising if these conjectures did not attain
some measure of truth; but those who will not accept
guesses even from the highest authority without testing them
will perceive that they bristle with difficulties. It is not
certain that the obscure Britanni, who are known to history
only as a Gaulish tribe and are not even mentioned by
Caesar, ever invaded Britain at all: the same writer who
tells us that they were the first comers tells us also that they
were Belgic, and that the Belgae were preceded by other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
Brythons;<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">977</a> and the Belgae, although they were last in the
field, were not forced to seek distant abodes, but conquered
the best parts of the country which were nearest to the
Continent. We know nothing and can learn nothing of the
history of the Belgic or the earlier Brythonic settlements.</p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg236" class="sidenote">‘Late
Celtic’
art.</div>

<p>The Brythonic invaders introduced the first beginnings of
the so-called Late Celtic art, which, remotely connected
with that of Central and Southern Europe, attained its
highest development in the British Isles. It was partly an
outgrowth of the culture which on the Continent is called
after the Helvetian settlement of La Tène, a village built on
piles in a bay of the lake of Neuchâtel. This culture, which
owed much to that of Hallstatt, has also been traced to
classical and even to Oriental sources; but in the century
which preceded the Roman conquest of Britain, while the
Continent was dominated by the influence of Rome, its
offspring asserted its own individuality.<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">978</a> The Belgic conquest,
which brought Britain into closer connexion with the
Continent, gave a powerful impetus to the spread of Late
Celtic art. The study of its details and of the evolution
of its various types belongs to archaeology; but a general
knowledge of its main features is essential to the understanding
of British history.</p>

<p>Late Celtic works of art are in general as easily recognized
as those of the Bronze Age, although only an expert could
assign a given specimen to its proper period; but they
are far more difficult to describe. While the chevron is
the characteristic feature of the older culture, that of the
younger is the curve. Rectilinear patterns, inherited from
the Bronze Age, appear on many Late Celtic objects, but
generally combined with those of curvilinear form.<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">979</a> Anthropomorphic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
and zoomorphic designs occasionally occur; and
although the examples which best illustrate this tendency&mdash;two
bronze-mounted buckets found at Marlborough<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">980</a> and
Aylesford<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">981</a>&mdash;were imported from Gaul, a bronze shield,
dredged up from the river Witham, which is decorated with
the figure of a boar, was undoubtedly of British workmanship.<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">982</a>
Geometrical designs are associated with representations
of natural forms; and in certain cases one may see the
latter becoming so conventionalized that they are tending
to pass into the former. The scroll-like curves which hang
from the mouths of the pair of confronted animals on the
Marlborough bucket represent twigs on which they are
supposed to have been browsing: certain scabbards are
embellished with undulating curves, of which the original
motive was an attempt to depict foliage; and everywhere
the effect of successive copying was to transmute forms
suggested by nature into sinuous lines, the origin of which is
veiled by their very beauty. The ultimate result was
a system of decoration which has been likened to the <i>flamboyant</i>,&mdash;the
flame-like tracery of decadent French Gothic
architecture.<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">983</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg237" class="sidenote">Coral and
enamel.</div>

<p>The Late Celtic artist was not content with merely devising
graceful lines on metal, wood, or earthenware: he often
adorned his creations with coral and enamel. Coral, which
was imported from the islands of Hyères, was no longer used
in Gaul after the middle of the third century before our era;
but in this country it remained in vogue until a much later
period.<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">984</a> The art of enamelling, which had been practised
long before in the Caucasus, was already known in Gaul
before coral fell into disuse. The centre of the industry
was the Aeduan town of Bibracte, on Mont Beuvray near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
Autun, where the crucibles, moulds, and polishing-stones of
the workers have been discovered; but the enamellers of
Britain elaborated the art to a far higher pitch of perfection.
Enamels of many colours were produced at a late stage,
but in pre-Roman times only red.<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">985</a> Originally, as on a bronze
helmet found in the Thames by Waterloo Bridge, the
enamel was let into parallel or crossed grooves scored on the
surface of the metal;<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">986</a> but afterwards, by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">champlevé</i>
process, a bed was scooped out for the reception of the fused
material, and thus, by the covering of larger surfaces, the
brilliancy of the effect was enhanced. The earlier British
enamels, which show no vestiges of Roman influence, are
found principally upon bridle-bits and harness-rings.<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">987</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg238" class="sidenote">Swords
and

<p>But Late Celtic art may be studied on many other objects
besides those which have been already mentioned. Though
British swords of the Early Iron Age are rare, and belong
for the most part to dates subsequent to the Belgic invasion,
a beautiful specimen of La Tène type was found in its
bronze sheath in the village-stronghold of Hunsbury near
Northampton;<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">988</a> and several have been recovered from the
Thames, the scabbard of one being ornamented with a basket-pattern
and open-work and an S-shaped scroll, another with
transverse bars like examples from La Tène and Somme
Bionne.<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">989</a> Late Celtic swords, which invariably had bronze
handles,<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">990</a> were not, like those of the Bronze Age, leaf-shaped:
their edges were nearly straight, and only tapered slightly
near the point. Some late specimens, more than three feet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
long and with blunt points, intended not for thrusting but
cutting, correspond to the description of Tacitus;<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">991</a> but others
are much shorter. A dagger-sheath, found in Oxfordshire,
is noticeable for its unusual decoration,&mdash;minute
punched ornament between two pairs of ribs, which follow
the outline of the edge,
and not a single curve;<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">992</a>
while a scabbard from the
Thames at Wandsworth

spirals and lozenges enclosed

<div id="PI_CV_Pg240" class="sidenote">Brooches
and pins.</div>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fibula</i> or brooch&mdash;the prototype of the modern safety-pin&mdash;which
had come into use on the Continent in the earliest
period of the Hallstatt culture, was not known in our island
before the Iron Age. Brooches of the successive La Tène
types, in all of which the pin was straight and the body
curved like a bow, have been found in considerable numbers;
one of the earliest, from Water Eaton in Oxfordshire, being
engraved with scrolls and the familiar ring-and-dot pattern,
while another, from Avebury,
was set with coral.<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">995</a>
Some brooches discovered
in the stronghold of Hod
Hill, near Blandford, had
been modelled upon an
Italian pattern of much
earlier date.<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">996</a> Pins, however,
were still used for
fastening the dress. Plain
ones, which may be as old
as the fourth century
before Christ, have been found at Hagbourne Hill in
Berkshire, and on the site of a pile-dwelling at Hammersmith,
and others, which are hardly distinguishable in
shape from a modern scarf-pin and belong to the period
immediately preceding the coming of the Romans, in various
parts of Scotland;<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">997</a> but one which lay among the relics in
a grave near Driffield was far more elaborately designed, its
head being a miniature chariot-wheel with four spokes,
curiously inlaid with shell.<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">998</a>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg241a" class="sidenote">Ornaments.</div>

<p>Of our Late Celtic ornaments many are undatable; and
while the torques and richly decorated collars which are
familiar to all antiquarians are common in early Gaulish
graves, those of this country which are most characteristic of
Late Celtic art appear to belong to the Roman period:<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">999</a>
but bronze bracelets set with paste were worn even in
Yorkshire; and a penannular bracelet with small tooth-like
projections, which closely resembles far earlier specimens
from Hallstatt, belongs to the same district.<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a> Of less costly
trinkets lathe-turned bangles of Kimmeridge shale,<a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">1001</a> glass

as works of art; but it is noteworthy that the beads, yellow,
green, and blue, with their zigzag patterns and wavy white
lines, which have been found at Glastonbury and in Yorkshire
barrows, are utterly different from those of the Bronze Age,
and belong mainly to a late period of the La Tène culture,
though some had analogues in the cemetery of Hallstatt.
As Glastonbury has also yielded pieces of glass slag and of
crucibles, the beads were probably manufactured on the
spot.<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">1004</a> For some reason which has not been explained gold
ornaments were apparently far rarer both in this country
and in Gaul than in the preceding period.<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">1005</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg241b" class="sidenote">Woodwork.</div>

<p>Among the finest examples of woodwork are bronze-mounted
tankards which have been found in Suffolk<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">1006</a> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
Merionethshire,<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">1007</a> the former being ornamented with circles
enclosed between bronze bands, and each containing the
mystic three-limbed figure, called the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">triskele</i>, which seems
to have been akin to the swastika; while the handle of the
latter is notable for its flamboyant tracery. Specimens of
a different kind include a beautiful bowl from Glastonbury,
the sweeping curves incised on its surface expanding into
circles and trumpet-like projections which enclose diagonal
cross-hatching, and a rectangular object from the same site,
which has no curves but is engraved with a step-like pattern
shaded with cross-hatching of double diagonals.<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a></p>

<p>Not less interesting is the Late Celtic pottery, which is
generally very different from that of the Bronze Age, and
the distinctive forms of which were first classified a few years
ago by the explorer of the cemetery at Aylesford. Since then
numerous examples of the same types have been found in
other parts of Kent and in Essex; but the influence was
felt as far north as Northamptonshire, and as far west as
Dorsetshire. These vessels were turned upon the wheel and
were much finer in quality than those of the Bronze Age.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
The most characteristic of the cinerary urns, which in outline
may be likened to a truncated pear, stand upon narrow
pedestals and are generally divided into zones by ridges and
corresponding grooves; while a few
are incised on the bottom with concentric
circles. They closely resemble
urns found in Belgic cemeteries
near St. Valéry-sur-Somme and in
the lower valley of the Seine, which
are nearly contemporary with them,
belonging to the latest period of
Gallic independence; but vases of
the same form had been deposited
three centuries earlier in the cemetery
of Somme-Bionne, where the
bodies had all been simply interred,
whereas the urns of Aylesford were
filled with cremated bones. The type, however, was not
indigenous in Gaul. Its descent has been traced to vessels
of earthenware found in North Italian graves of the fifth
and fourth centuries before Christ, which were in their turn
derived from bronze vases common on both shores of the
Northern Adriatic. The cordons on the bronze vessels were
simply survivals of wooden rings that compacted a frame
of staves to which metal plates had been riveted.<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p></div>

<p>Pedestalled vases were not the only pottery found at
Aylesford and the analogous sites. There were others, bowl-shaped
or with low globular bodies, some of which were also
cordoned, while a few had the triangular decoration characteristic
of the Bronze Age.</p>

<p>Domestic vessels of wholly different forms have also been
recovered, some with handles on either side, and perforated
bases, which were perhaps used for draining honey-combs,
and others which are more easily recognized as Late Celtic
by their flamboyant decoration. A fragment of this ware
was taken from the same cavern near Torquay which had
been used as a dwelling-place in palaeolithic times. Household
pottery was still commonly made by hand; and
while some specimens were without any ornament, others
had rectilinear patterns of such a kind that, but for the
associations in which they were found, they would have
been referred unhesitatingly to the Age of Bronze.<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg244" class="sidenote">The
noblest
creation
of Late
Celtic art.</div>

<p>If archaeologists were invited to name the noblest creation
of Late Celtic art, I think that with one consent they would
point to the bronze shield which was lost in the Thames, and
found after it had lain there some nineteen hundred years.
Oblong with rounded ends and gently contracted in the
middle, the outline forming an endless curve, it is adorned
with three successive circles of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">repoussé</i> work, a large central
one and two smaller, connected by sinuous lines, within
which lesser circles are contained. The central piece of each
greater circle is a boss enclosing enamelled swastika designs
and surrounded by curves, S-shaped and C-shaped, which
begin and end with the same mysterious device. Yet, though
the beauty of form remains, the glory of colouring is gone;
and one can only now imagine how, when the shield hung
upon the forgotten warrior’s arm, gleaming bronze and raised
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
curves and red enamel combined to produce their due effect.
Like Stonehenge this was the work of a master: not one
detail could be altered, or removed, or added without impairing
its perfection.<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">1011</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg246" class="sidenote">Imported
objects of
art.</div>

<p>Among the products of Late Celtic art that have been
found in Britain are some of foreign manufacture, which
testify to the increased commercial activity that followed
the Belgic invasion. Besides the bronze-mounted bucket,
already mentioned, the Aylesford cemetery yielded a bronze
flagon, which had been made in Northern Italy:<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a> an elegant
Graeco-Italian two-handled cup of black glazed earthenware
with white foliated ornament encircling its inner margin was
discovered in the rick-yard of the Manor Farm at Dorchester
in Oxfordshire;<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">1013</a> while the Marlborough bucket is adorned
with figures of sea-horses which are common on Gallic coins of
the neighbourhood of Rennes, and which warrant the conjecture
that it was imported from North-Western Gaul,<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">1014</a> perhaps
in one of the vessels that plied between the Loire and Ictis.
What else besides tin the Britons in the days of their independence
exported in return for such articles we do not
know; but in a later chapter we shall see that a long list
of their exports and imports was compiled by Strabo.<a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">1015</a> The
carrying-trade was for the most part in the hands of Gallic
ship-owners; but some cargoes were perhaps loaded in
British bottoms. The British envoys who presented themselves
in Caesar’s camp in 55 <small>B.C.</small> may indeed have crossed
the Channel in a Gallic merchantman, and so may the hostages
who were sent to him after his first invasion of Britain;
but it is unlikely that the maritime Belgic tribes, who must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
<span id="PI_CV_Pg247a" class="sidenote">British ships and coracles.</span>
have set out from Gaul in ships of their own, built none after
they had settled in Britain, or that the numerous British adventurers
who reinforced Caesar’s Gallic enemies depended
for their transport upon the latter. The only British vessels,
however, which are expressly mentioned by our authorities
were light coracles of lath covered with hides, which Caesar
observed when he was in Kent and afterwards copied when
he was fighting in Spain against Pompey’s lieutenants,<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">1016</a> and
which are still used by Irish fishermen off the coast of
Connaught.<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a> These boats were doubtless employed in
coastal navigation and on inland waterways; but much of
the intertribal traffic must have been carried on along trackways,
<span id="PI_CV_Pg247b" class="sidenote">Trackways.</span>
which are still traceable, and the prehistoric antiquity
of which is proved by their association with hill-forts. Most
of them, like the Pilgrim’s Way, which is known to all who
have tramped the high grounds of Surrey and Kent, ran
along ridges or the slopes of downs which were generally
unencumbered by forest or morass. If their origin could be
traced, we should find that they were formed by the earliest
settlers who felt the need of communication, along the lines
of least resistance which nomadic hunters had followed when
they passed from one temporary settlement to another;<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a>
and doubtless attempts were made to render them more
suitable for wheeled traction when the Cornish miners began
to convey their tin in wagons to the coast, and the invaders
of the Iron Age brought their chariots from Gaul. Even then,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
however, wheel-less vehicles, like those which Sir Arthur
Mitchell noticed a few years ago in Strathglass and Kintail,
must have been used for carting timber down steep hills or
over heaths where no wheeled carriage could have moved.<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg248" class="sidenote">Coinage.</div>

<p>Foreign commerce as well as domestic trade were greatly
stimulated by the introduction of coinage and by the
development of a ruder form of currency. Towards the
end of the fourth century before the Christian era
the Greeks of Massilia had introduced into Gaul gold
coins of Philip of Macedon, which bore on the obverse
a representation of the head of Apollo wreathed in laurel,
and on the reverse a charioteer driving a pair of horses
with the name <i>Philippos</i> stamped underneath. On these
coins the Gallic coinage was modelled, and the British
coinage was derived mainly from that of Gaul or through
Gaul from a Macedonian stater; for certain peculiarities
are noticeable on our earliest coins which distinguish them
from those of Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a> Evidently a considerable time must
have elapsed before the new art travelled from Southern to
Northern Gaul, and again before it crossed the Channel; and
it is only natural to find that the oldest and heaviest British
coins weigh no more than a hundred and twenty grains, or
thirteen grains lighter than the Philippus, although, on the
other hand, they are heavier than Gallic coins which belong
to the latter half of the second century before Christ.<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a> Until
about a quarter of a century after Caesar’s invasion the
British coins were uninscribed: indeed uninscribed coins
were still current during the earlier years of the Roman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
occupation.<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a> Their weight gradually diminished; and
gradually, owing to successive copying, the head of Apollo
and his wreath, the charioteer, the chariot, and the horses
became more and more conventionalized and degraded, the
head in certain cases passing ultimately into a cruciform
pattern or even into a four-leaved flower, the charioteer being
evolved into pellets, and the pair of horses becoming first one,
then more and more grotesque until it lost all resemblance
to a quadruped. Die-sinkers (who were doubtless few)
would use the same dies or follow the same general type
during their working career; and new types appeared when
their successors came to engrave new dies. By estimating the
time which would have been required for these successive
alterations, it has been calculated that the earliest British
coins must have been struck about a hundred and fifty or
perhaps two hundred years before the birth of Christ.<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a></p>

<p>For many years the only coins of Britain were gold of two
values, the smaller being a quarter of the weight of the larger;<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a>
and it may be gathered from the testimony of Strabo<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a> and
Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a> that they were made, at all events in part, from
metal extracted from the alluvial deposits of the Cornish
peninsula. Coins of silver, bronze, and even tin were afterwards
circulated, but probably not before the era of redoubled
commercial activity which began when the British islands
became more closely connected with the Continent in consequence
of Caesar’s invasion: indeed many of the silver
coins are little earlier than the time of Claudius.<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a> Specimens
of all these metals are much scarcer than those of gold.
Only two British tin coins are known to exist; and in the
western counties no bronze coin has ever been found.<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a></p>

<p>Specimens of the prototype of British gold coins have
been found more frequently in Kent than in any other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
county; and it may be inferred that, as might have been
expected, they were first struck in the more civilized district
which was nearest to the Continent.<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a> For a long period
indeed the gold currency was confined to the southern and
eastern districts: before Caesar’s time there is no evidence
that any tribes coined money except those whose territories
lay south of a line drawn from the Wash to the Bristol
Channel; and even from these the peoples of Gloucestershire,
Northern Somersetshire, and Northern Wiltshire must
probably be excluded.<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a> Uninscribed coins have indeed
occurred as far north as Yorkshire,<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a> and as far west as
Cornwall;<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a> but they had found their way thither from other
tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">1033</a></p>

<p>Many coins of British origin which have been discovered
in France, especially in the Belgic territory,<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">1034</a> and many
Gallic coins in South-Eastern Britain, bear further witness
to the development of international trade.<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">1035</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg250" class="sidenote">Iron currency
bars.</div>

<p>But coins were not the only medium of exchange. Caesar,
in his description of the manners and customs of the Britons,
remarked that some of them made use of iron bars of specified
weights as a substitute for coins.<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">1036</a> Until a very recent
period antiquaries were waiting for some lucky find which
might corroborate the accuracy of Caesar’s statement, not
knowing that the evidence was before their eyes and only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
needed interpretation. Within the last eighty years a large
number of iron bars have been unearthed in Berkshire,
Northamptonshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, Somersetshire,
Dorsetshire, Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight.
Many of them were found on well-known sites of the Early
Iron Age, such as the lake-village of Glastonbury, and the
forts of Hod Hill and Spettisbury; and some of the hoards
comprised very numerous specimens&mdash;amounting in two
cases to about one hundred and fifty, and in a third to three
hundred and ninety-four&mdash;which had been buried deep in
the ground. A tiro might take them for swords; but to
the experts who compare them with the known swords of
the Late Celtic Period it is evident that they contain too
much metal; and, moreover, they may be arranged, according
to their weight, in three groups, the heaviest being twice as
valuable as the intermediate, and four times as valuable as
the lightest. Not a single specimen has come to light in the
eastern and south-eastern counties, in which coins are most
abundant.<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">1037</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg251" class="sidenote">Mining.</div>

<p>The British iron-mines of which Caesar speaks were
situated in the Wealden Forest; and although they were not
finally abandoned before the nineteenth century, it is
probable that some of the pits which mark the site of the
works were excavated by British miners.<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">1038</a> But the iron
from which some of the currency-bars were wrought was
obtained, in the opinion of an eminent metallurgist, from the
Forest of Dean,<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">1039</a> and, as we shall presently see,<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a> those which
were found in Northamptonshire may have been manufactured
on the spot. Mining indeed was one of the principal
industries of Britain. Tin was still exported, if not in
<span class="sidenote">About 100 <small>B.C.</small></span>
Caesar’s time, at least as late as that of Posidonius;<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a> copper
was still needed for bronze ornaments, horse-trappings,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
sword-sheaths, and other objects, and indeed in certain
districts for cutting-tools;<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">1042</a> and although the numerous
‘pigs’ of lead which have been found in Staffordshire and
Cheshire belong to the time of the Empire, the discovery of
leaden celts and sword-pommels of the Bronze Age<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">1043</a> raises
the presumption that the mines of those districts, of the
Mendip Hills, Flintshire, and the neighbourhood of Matlock
may have been worked even by the Britons.<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">1044</a></p>

<p>Looking at all these tokens of industrial enterprise, one is
prepared to find evidences of increased comfort and more
<span id="PI_CV_Pg252" class="sidenote">Agriculture.</span>
settled conditions of life. Since the Bronze Age agriculture
had undoubtedly made a notable advance. It is impossible
to tell whether the Britons, like the Gauls, recognized private
property in land;<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">1045</a> but archaeology has furnished abundant
evidence, which confirms Caesar’s statement, that at all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
events in the south-eastern districts corn was grown in plenty.
When he made his first expedition to Britain, his army,
numbering at least twelve thousand men, reaped enough
wheat in the near neighbourhood of Walmer to supply its
wants for a fortnight or more; while in the following year
he requisitioned from the people of Essex grain for four
legions with their auxiliaries and seventeen hundred cavalry,
which was delivered within a few days.<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">1046</a> An iron sickle
and a ploughshare found in Bigbury camp near Canterbury;<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">1047</a>
traces of terrace cultivation on the Sussex downs;<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">1048</a> grain
of several kinds stored in Worlebury Fort, in the Glastonbury
lake-village, and in Hunsbury, where also were found
fragments of stone querns in such profusion that every
family may well have possessed its own, bear witness to the
industry of the British farmers.<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">1049</a> So also perhaps do the
famous dene-holes of Kent, Essex, and Norfolk, whose purpose
has been a theme of voluminous controversy, but of
which the most satisfactory explanation seems to be that
they were for the most part subterranean granaries, which
may have been used as refuges in time of danger, and that
the chalk extracted in the process of excavation was used,
as Pliny says, for manuring fields.<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">1050</a> Under the necessity of
cultivating fresh land considerable progress must have been
made in clearing the forests; and axes, saws, and bill-hooks,
with which the woodmen worked, are still to be seen.<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a> It is
true that even in the more civilized south the great Wealden
Forest, in which swine, guarded by fierce dogs, fed secure
among wolves and foxes, badgers, and deer, still extended
beyond the chalk downs from the neighbourhood of West
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
Hythe to the eastern border of Hampshire, reached northward
as far as Sevenoaks, and skirted the Surrey Hills; while
great parts of Essex were overgrown with wood; another
forest overshadowed the valley of the Kennet from Hungerford
to Windsor; and the Isle of Ely was surrounded by
broad meres, swelled by the heavier rains which fell in those
days.<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a> But even in Essex much timber must have been
removed to make room for the cornfields from which the
Trinovantes supplied Caesar’s legions, and in Kent to form
the denes in which cattle grazed; while of those myriad homesteads
which Caesar passed on his devastating march not
a few must have been built upon reclaimed land.</p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg254a" class="sidenote">Dwellings
of the rich.</div>

<p>The researches of the eminent scholar who has so greatly
enlarged our knowledge of Roman Britain have led him to
suggest that among these homesteads there may have been,
besides the round Celtic huts, dwellings, belonging to the
rich, which might almost be described as country houses.
Under Roman administration the rural parts of Britain, as
of Northern Gaul, were parcelled into estates, the owners of
which let out the greater part to cultivators who were in a
state of semi-serfdom, while their demesne lands were tilled
by slaves. The houses belong to two types, known as the
Corridor type and the Courtyard type, neither of which
exists anywhere save in Britain and the north of Gaul.
The corridor house consisted of a row of rooms with a passage
running along them: the other of three such rows, which
formed three sides of a quadrangle. Since there is little
resemblance between either of these types and those of Italy,
it may be assumed that the extant examples of both, although
they had been made luxurious by Roman mosaics and hypocausts
and baths, were but modified representatives of the
chieftains’ houses which Caesar saw.<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg254b" class="sidenote">Towns.</div>

<p>Nor were petty hamlets and isolated cottages the only
places of abode. Town-life was beginning to emerge. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
Britons, like the Gauls, had large fortified villages, which
afterwards gave place to the flourishing Romano-British
towns whose secrets are being revealed by pick and shovel.
Camulodunum, or Colchester, the chief town of the Trinovantes,
and Verulamium, hard by St. Albans, the chief town
of the Catuvellauni, each of which had its mint before the
Roman conquest, were doubtless tribal centres before Caesar
came.<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a> So too, probably, was Corinium, the capital of the
Dobuni, which stood upon the site of Cirencester;<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a> and
Calleva, now Silchester, the excavation of which has been
pursued for many years with illuminating results, was
surrounded by a rampart which had evidently defended the
capital of the Atrebates in pre-Roman times.<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a> London,
which, if we may trust Ptolemy,<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a> was in the territory of the
Cantii, was probably not less ancient; for <i>Augusta</i>, the
name which Roman officialism endeavoured to impose upon
it, was unable to resist the vitality of the Celtic appellation.<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a>
Imaginative historians have pictured British London in the
midst of a vast lagoon;<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a> but although the site of Westminster
Abbey was an island surrounded by a marsh, and
the Walbrook, where it flowed into the Thames, was little
less than a hundred yards in width, it was proved during
the construction of a sewer in London Wall that the land
on the north side of the city had in Roman times been as
dry as it is to-day.<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg255" class="sidenote">Hill-forts.</div>

<p>The tribal capitals were of course fortified; but the old
hill strongholds of the Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age had
not been abandoned; and new ones were doubtless constructed
as occasion required. Among those that have
yielded remains of the Late Celtic Period the most famous
are Worlebury, which crowns a headland just north of
Weston-super-mare; Hod Hill, which rises sheer above the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
valley of the Stour, four miles north-west of Blandford;
Bigbury Camp, through which runs the Pilgrim’s Way;
and Winkelbury Camp in South Wiltshire, Mount Caburn,
overhanging Lewes, and Cissbury Camp, already mentioned
for its neolithic factory, which have been excavated by
General Pitt-Rivers. Worlebury is the most remarkable of
the few stone forts in the west of England. Unlike the great
earthworks it has no ditch, because it needed none; and
on its northern side a limestone precipice rendered fortification
superfluous. The rampart is a vast wall, compacted
with rubble and faced on either side with dry masonry; and,
to prevent an enemy from demolishing it, the outer face
was buttressed by heaps of loose stones. Many of the
modern walls in the neighbourhood of the fortress are
indistinguishable from it in structure.<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">1061</a> At Winkelbury large
openings were left in that part of the rampart which is contiguous
to the plain, probably to enable cattle to be driven
in rapidly when marauders were near; while another
rampart, which bisects the camp, may have been designed
to separate the cattle-pound from the quarters of the garrison.<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">1062</a>
Cissbury, the principal fort on the Sussex Downs,
was one of the few British strongholds which appear to have
had access to a permanent supply of water: about a mile and
a half off, at a place called Broadwater, is a spring, abundant
enough for an army, which is connected by a trackway with
the southern entrance.<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">1063</a> The most characteristic feature of
Mount Caburn is the number of pits which, as at Worlebury,
are contained within its area. In both camps these pits are
so small that they could not have been ordinarily inhabited,
although, during a siege, they might have afforded shelter:
probably they were used as store-rooms, for some of them
contained corn.<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">1064</a> Dwellings, however, were connected with
them; for the remains of a clay wall were discovered on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
Mount Caburn, impressed with marks of wattle-work; and
it may be inferred that many such huts, which have left no
trace, once existed within the ramparts.<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">1065</a> Bigbury was
probably one of the entrenchments of which Caesar was
thinking when he said that ‘the Britons apply the term
fortress to woods difficult of access and fortified with
rampart and trench in which they are in the habit of taking
refuge from a hostile raid’.<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a> The familiar sentence was
a stumbling-block to Pitt-Rivers; for, as we have seen, the
British forts were as a rule constructed upon treeless heights,
and the presence of trees upon the slopes would have been
incompatible with the designs of the engineers: but Caesar’s
observations must of course be accepted; and we can only
suppose that the entrenchments which he described were
exceptional even in the region which was the theatre of his
campaign.<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a> May we conjecture that they had been erected
in the Iron Age by Celtic immigrants, and that their lack of
finish was due to the lazy shrinking from the hard labour of
fortification which Caesar regarded as characteristic of the
Gauls?<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">1068</a></p>

<p>The fort of Pen-y-Gaer, which overlooks the valley of the
Conway, is remarkable as an almost unique specimen of
ancient military engineering. A storming-party which had
succeeded in passing the two outer ditches would have fallen,
in attempting the next, under the missiles that showered
from the rampart, on to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevaux de frise</i> of pointed stones.<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">1069</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg257" class="sidenote">Some permanently
inhabited.</div>

<p>The relics that have been collected from the hill-forts of
the Iron Age prove that the forts themselves, like those of
Gaul, were not merely places of refuge but permanent abodes.
Those that were situated on heights extremely difficult of
access or remote from water were of course very sparsely
inhabited in time of peace; but others were analogous to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
the Gallic fortresses which Caesar called <i>oppida</i>, and which
were evidently distinct from the refuges, such as Aduatuca,
which he designated as <i>castella</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">1070</a> Pottery, it is true, would
have been indispensable even during a few days’ siege; and
the stone lamp, resembling that of Grimes’s Graves,<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a> and
blackened by use, which was recovered from Castle Law in
Perthshire,<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a> might well have been needed at such a time.
But when we find bill-hooks, ploughshares, bridle-bits, and
fragments of querns among the objects that had been left in
the forts which have been mentioned, it is clear that they
were occupied by an industrial population: iron slag, which
lay among the deposits on Hod Hill, was evidence of metallurgy;
while the loom-weights which were collected on the
same spot, the bone weaving-combs of Cissbury and Mount
Caburn, and the spindle-whorls which abounded not only
in these comparatively civilized settlements but also in
a stone fortress on far St. David’s Head show that among
the inhabitants were women who pursued their ordinary
domestic avocations.<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a> This Welsh stronghold was almost
identical in construction with Carn Brea,<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a> and the hut-circles
which the two contain are exactly alike; yet the time which
had elapsed since the Cornish ramparts were thrown up was
as long as that which separates us from Alfred the Great.<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a></p>

<p>Although many of the Scottish forts can be referred to
the Early Iron Age, it would perhaps be impossible to prove
that the relics found in any of them were earlier than the
time of Caesar’s invasion;<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a> but two have an interest of their
own as being the only examples that have yet been observed
in Britain of fortifications constructed, like the Gallic walls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
which he described,<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a> conjointly of timber and stone. In one
of them, situated at Burghead near Elgin, wooden logs were
actually discovered in the stone walls;<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a> while at Castle Law,
which stands upon a hill commanding a view over the Tay,
as it winds through the carse on the west and loses itself in
its eastern estuary, the outer face of the wall contained
rectangular openings, which had manifestly been designed
for the reception of beams.<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg259" class="sidenote">Hunsbury.</div>

<p>While the hill-forts were probably only inhabited permanently
by comparatively small numbers, and, like Gergovia,
the mountain-city of Auvergne, where Vercingetorix
defeated Caesar, may have sheltered thousands of fugitives
in time of need, one stronghold at least of the other group
was a town in the strictest sense of the word. Hunsbury,
the most celebrated representative of this class, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
stands upon high ground about two miles south-west of
Northampton, might never have surrendered its precious
relics if the iron ore which was known to underlie the site
had not attracted the prospector. About thirty years ago a
company was formed to win the iron; and navvies accidentally
did the work which would have been better performed
under scientific direction. Hunsbury is so small that it could
hardly have been a tribal centre: the entrenchment encloses
only four acres,&mdash;less than the twelfth part of the area of
Hod Hill. Not the faintest trace of Roman influence could
be detected among the remains, which are now arranged in
the Northampton Museum; and the experts who examined
them concluded that they belonged to the time of Caesar’s
invasion. They were found in pits, resembling those of Mount
Caburn, about three hundred of which had been dug inside
the rampart; and here too there was evidence that the
dwellings had been huts of wattle-work. The townspeople
were well armed: they kept horses and chariots, wove their
own cloth, sawed their own timber, made their own earthenware,
and grew their own corn; and heaps of slag showed
that they had smelted the ore, which lay thenceforward
undisturbed for nineteen hundred years.<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a> One of several
skulls which were found just outside the town was perforated
with three holes, which suggest that the British Celts, like
the Gauls and their neolithic predecessors, made amulets out
of the remains of their own dead.<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg260" class="sidenote">Inhabited caves;
pit-dwellings;
‘Picts’
houses’;

houses;
and
brochs.</div>

<p>But perhaps not many British settlements were of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
comparatively advanced type. In the Late Celtic Period,
and indeed long after its close, caves were still inhabited, as
throughout the prehistoric ages, in some cases by outlaws,
who made a precarious livelihood by robbing wealthy
travellers.<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a> Pit-dwellings in small groups, which apparently
differed little from those of the Neolithic Age, have been
found stored with Late Celtic relics;<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">1083</a> and doubtless it was
from habitations of this class that the thatched huts of mud
and wattle-work which Strabo<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a> describes, and the remains
of which have been already noticed, were evolved. Such
cottages, as Caesar<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a> testifies, were much the same in Gaul and
Britain. Posidonius was made welcome in them when he
travelled in Gaul. He tells us how his hosts, seated on
straw round low tables, took their meat in their fingers and
tore it like lions or chopped it in pieces with their pocket-knives,
and washed it down with draughts of beer from
earthenware or silver beakers; how the meal was sometimes
interrupted by a quarrel, when the disputants sprang to
their feet and fought till one was slain.<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a> In the far north
and in the Cornish peninsula men lived in underground
dwellings, commonly called ‘Picts’ houses’, which generally
consisted of a paved trench lined with dry masonry, roofed
over with slabs, and terminating in a round chamber; while
in some Scottish examples rooms were grouped on both
sides of the gallery.<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a> Related to these structures are the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
Scottish mound-dwellings or bee-hive houses, specimens of
which in the island of Lewis were still inhabited in the nineteenth
century. They may be looked for in places such as
the Hebrides, where branches large enough to form roofs
like those of pit-dwellings were not to be had. In some a
central chamber was connected with others which opened
out of it: a hole, which could be closed at will, was left in the
roof for the escape of smoke; the chinks between the stones
were stuffed with grass or moss; and the roof was covered
with turf, which adhered to the interstices and made the
structure compact. It is impossible to assign a precise date
to these huts. Some of them contained querns and were
certainly occupied in the time of the Romans; but probably
many had been built before, while others are comparatively
modern.<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a> The most elaborate buildings of this type were the
brochs, whose range extends from the Orkney and Shetland
Isles, which contain nearly a hundred and fifty, to Berwickshire,
but which do not exist outside the Scottish area.
These buildings, which were really small forts, represent the
art of dry-walling at its zenith. They were round towers
about sixty feet high and fifty feet in diameter. If an
enemy succeeded in forcing a way in, he found himself in an
inner court open to the sky and enclosed by a commanding
wall, pierced by numerous apertures, which formed the
windows of encircling galleries, from behind which the
defenders were prepared to shoot.<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">1089</a> The relics which have
been found in them belong for the most part to the close of
the Roman occupation and even later; but some which have
been excavated in Caithness contained painted pebbles like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
those of the late palaeolithic cavern of Mas d’Azil; and it is
possible that they may have existed in pre-Roman times.<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg263" class="sidenote">The Glastonbury marsh-village.</div>

<p>The most interesting, however, of all the Late Celtic
settlements is the far-famed marsh-village of Glastonbury.
Besides those of Holderness, which have been already mentioned,
there are several lake-dwellings in Great Britain
which belonged to the Early Iron Age; but almost all seem
to have been built after the commencement of the Christian
era.<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a> Glastonbury, on the other hand, was first inhabited
more than two centuries before the Roman conquest. The
peat-moor on which it stands was then surrounded by a
shallow mere, and is now covered by low circular mounds
which mark the positions of the former huts. Timber and
brushwood, surmounted by layers of clay and stones, were
laid upon the peat to serve as foundations, and retained in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
place by piles fixed round their margins. The huts were
then built of wood, filled in with wattle and daub; and the
entire village was protected by a palisade. The foundations
were, however, so unstable that they gradually sank; and
in order to keep the floors dry, fresh timber and clay were
periodically added. When this was done, the old hearth-stones
were left undisturbed; and their presence attests the
construction of the successive floors. Among the numerous
relics which excavation has revealed, and which prove that
skilled agriculturists, potters, weavers, wood-carvers, and
coopers lived in the village, there is hardly a single weapon:
the sling-bullets evidently served only for killing game.
Dozens of coloured pebbles, similar to others which have
been found on Hod Hill, were perhaps used in some indoor
game;<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a> and the spur of a cock may suggest to those who
remember that the Britons thought it impious to eat poultry
that the pastime for which, as Caesar says, the birds were
reared was cockfighting.<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a> It is hardly necessary to mention
the weaving-combs, the spindle-whorls, the querns, the
harness-buckles, and the other objects which are common
in Late Celtic settlements, though it is curious that the
bridle-bits were made of deer-horn; but the explorers were
astonished to find a bronze mirror, tweezers, rouge, and
other exotic objects, which showed that continental luxury
had invaded this remote region.<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg264" class="sidenote">Dress.</div>

<p>The arts of the toilet had indeed been elaborated not
only in the more civilized south but even in places which,
like the Yorkshire Wolds, had no direct communication with
foreign lands.<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a> The tunics, the cloaks which men and
women alike wore, fastened on the right shoulder with a
brooch, the breeches which were common to Brythonic Celts
in Britain and Gaul, and the use of which seems to have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
borrowed by the Continental Celts from the Scythians,<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a> the
kilts which, as we may perhaps infer from stone monuments,<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a>
were the national garb of the Goidels, were made, like the
modern tartan, of many-coloured cloths; while the men
whom Caesar encountered, although, like the Gauls, they
wore their hair long, and cultivated moustaches, carefully
shaved the rest of their faces and even their bodies.<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">1098</a> The

<div id="PI_CV_Pg265" class="sidenote">Reading
and
writing.</div>

<p>Nor indeed are indications wanting that Britons of the
upper class&mdash;not Druids only&mdash;had some tincture of letters.
The Druids of Gaul, and presumably also of Britain, used
Greek characters in official documents and private correspondence.<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">1100</a>
Diodorus<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a> affirms that it was common among
the Gauls to throw letters, addressed to the dead, on to the
funeral pile. The Romans, after they had defeated the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
Helvetii, found in their encampment a schedule, on which
were recorded in Greek characters the numbers of the armed
men, the women, and the children who had migrated into
Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a> A few years later, when Caesar was marching through
the territory of a Belgic tribe to relieve a besieged camp
commanded by Quintus Cicero, he wrote him a letter in
Greek characters&mdash;possibly in Greek<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a>&mdash;which he entrusted
to a Gallic trooper. Unless he made his interpreter write
the letter in Celtic, he evidently had reason to fear that, if
it were intercepted, some of the Belgae would be able to
read the Latin; in any case that some of them knew how to
read. Is it not reasonable to infer that a British Belgian
here and there was as good a scholar as his kinsmen over the
water? At all events the British inscribed coins, the earlier
of which at least must have been the work of native die-sinkers,
are evidence that before the birth of Christ there
were Britons who had mastered the art of writing, and had
even acquired some slight knowledge of Latin.<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a> But the
origins of Celtic literature, sacred and profane, were of
course purely oral. Bards, who were apparently Druids of
an inferior grade, sat at the tables of the great; accompanied
them with their harps to festivals; sang their praises
and satirized their enemies; and recited poems in honour
of valiant warriors who had fallen in battle.<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg266" class="sidenote">Inequalities

culture.</div>

<p>It must not, however, be supposed that the same level of
culture had been attained in every part of the island. The
Scottish specimens of Late Celtic workmanship are for the
most part later than the Claudian conquest;<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a> and it is
probable that in outlying districts even of England and
Wales iron tools in pre-Roman times were rare or unknown.
No objects of the Early Iron Age which are regarded as purely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
British have been found in Lancashire;<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a> and even on
Cranborne Chase, where one might have expected that
continental improvements would have been adopted at
least as early as in the far western settlement at Glastonbury,
the searching exploration of Pitt-Rivers could detect no
signs of any interval between the Bronze Age and the period
of the Roman occupation.<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a> Indeed the association of late
bronze implements and weapons with iron harness-rings
and bridle-bits at Hagbourne Hill<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">1109</a> suggests that some of
the deposits which are assigned to the Bronze Age may have
belonged either to a period of transition or even to the time
when, in South-Eastern Britain, the use of iron was universal.<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">1110</a>
Readers of the <cite>Commentaries</cite> would see nothing surprising
in this. Caesar was told that the people of the interior for
the most part did not grow corn, but lived on milk and flesh-meat
and clothed themselves in skins.<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">1111</a> This information
was somewhat misleading; for remains of four different kinds
of corn were counted at Hunsbury; and since cloth and linen
were worn in Yorkshire by the well-to-do even in the Bronze
Age,<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">1112</a> it is not to be supposed that their successors had lost
the arts of spinning and weaving. Still, Caesar’s statement
points to an ascertained truth. It has been well observed
that the western and northern uplands held out far longer
against the Roman conquest than the central, eastern, and
southern lowlands, and that they were never really Romanized
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
at all.<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a> From the earliest times their inhabitants had
been less open to continental and civilizing influences; and
one of the gifts which Nature had bestowed upon Britain
was that the regions more accessible from over sea were also
more fitted to sustain an industrial population.<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a> Later on,
however, we shall find reason, in the juxtaposition of old and

had not prevented the survival of the earlier

<div id="PI_CV_Pg268" class="sidenote">Intertribal
war and
political
development.</div>

<p>Moreover, notwithstanding the progress in material civilization,
intertribal fighting was of course still frequent even in
the south, and even after the Belgic tribes had settled down
in the territories which their swords had won, and established
themselves as the dominant people of Britain. Both Caesar<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">1116</a>
and Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">1117</a> spoke of these wars; but if they had been
silent, the numerous strongholds which were still occupied,
permanently, or as occasion required, the weapons that have
been found in them, the beach-rolled pebbles, the round
chipped flints, and the bullets of baked clay which lie heaped
in and near them would tell the same tale;<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">1118</a> nor indeed is it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
necessary to insist upon a fact which is universal in the stage
of culture in which the Britons then were. What is worthy
of remark is that war was probably entered upon from
motives other than those which had caused the struggles of
earlier ages. Raids were no doubt still undertaken, especially
in the poorer and less settled districts, by mere plunderers
and cattle-lifters. But clans were tending to become welded,
not only by the voluntary combination which was necessary
for defence, but also perhaps by the sword of the ambitious
captain, into the larger communities which Caesar called
<i>civitates</i><a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">1119</a>; and successful chiefs were assuming the state of
petty kings. As trade increased, and with it wealth, the
king of a tribe which was fortunately situated would seize
opportunities of acquiring dominion or overlordship over
others. Though forest or mountain or fen might enable
even small tribes to hold their own, and though the success
of a strong king might not endure, it is possible, as we shall
see, to discern in Caesar’s memoirs signs that attempts were
already being made to achieve such sovereignty as might
eventually lead towards political union, and we may suppose
that in Britain also there were astute princes who, like the
Aeduan Dumnorix, saw that they could strengthen their
position by diplomacy or marriage.<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">1120</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg269" class="sidenote">Instances
of female
sovereignty:
the
condition
of women.</div>

<p>We all learned in childhood that the Britons admitted the
sovereignty of women. In the middle of the first century
Cartismandua was queen of the Brigantes;<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">1121</a> and a few
years later, when the Iceni revolted against Rome, their
general was Boudicca, who is better known by the barbarous
misnomer of Boadicea.<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">1122</a> The Gauls may have had the
same institution; and perhaps it would hardly be worth
noticing if it were not apparently inconsistent with what
Caesar tells us about the status of Gallic wives. They were
indeed permitted to own property. The bride brought a
dowry to her husband; but he was obliged to add an equivalent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
from his own estate and to administer the whole as a
joint possession, which, with its accumulated increments,
went to the survivor.<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">1123</a> On the other hand, the husband had
the power of life and death over his wife<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">1124</a> as well as his
children; and when a man of rank died his relations, if they
had any suspicion of foul play, examined his wife, like a slave,
by torture, and, if they found her guilty, condemned her
to perish in the flames of the funeral pyre.<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">1125</a></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg270" class="sidenote">Political
and social
conditions
of Britain
and Gaul
compared.</div>

<p>When we try to form an idea of the political and the social
conditions of Britain in the later days of its independence,
we naturally turn to Caesar’s account of Gaul in the hope of
supplementing the scanty and scattered scraps of information
which he has left about the country which was less
known to him. We must, however, bear in mind that Britain
had not yet come under the two currents of influence, German
and Roman, which had profoundly affected Gaul, and in
some measure prepared it to accept Roman dominion; and
also that even the south-east was in a more rudimentary
stage than the neighbouring country, though perhaps not
more than the backward parts of Belgic Gaul.</p>

<p>When Caesar came to Gaul, revolutionary forces were at
work to which there are analogies in the earlier history of
Greece and Rome. Many of the states had expelled their
kings, whose authority had passed in some cases into the
hands of annually elected magistrates, while in others perhaps
the council of elders kept the government to itself. But
these oligarchies were never long secure. The magistrates
were fettered by rules, jealously framed, which weakened
their executive power. Like the Tarquins, the banished
kings or their descendants looked out for opportunities, which
Caesar’s policy offered to them, of regaining their position;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
while eloquent nobles who had contrived to amass wealth
summoned their retainers, hired mercenaries, surrounded
themselves with desperadoes or with the discontented poor,
whose grievances they promised to redress, and occasionally
succeeded, like Pisistratus of Athens, in making themselves
tyrants. Celtillus, the father of the great Vercingetorix, had
acquired a kind of supremacy over the whole of Celtican
Gaul; but he was dogged by the jealousy of his brother
nobles, who put him to death on the charge of plotting to
revive the kingship. Monarchy and oligarchy had each
their partisans: everywhere there were adventurers who
hoped to make their way to fortune by Roman aid, while
others, eager to oust their rivals, were ready to welcome
German invaders; and thus every state, every clan, every
hamlet, nay, every household was riven by faction.<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">1126</a> But
in Britain there is no sign that either oligarchy or tyranny
had yet anywhere supplanted monarchy. Still, there were
doubtless many points of resemblance. We may suppose
that in Britain, as in Gaul, the tribal king was assisted by
a council of elders; that the British, like the Gallic nobles,
had their devoted retainers and perhaps also dependents
who had fallen into their debt;<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">1127</a> that only those who became
their dependents could expect protection, and that only
those lords who were strong enough to protect could count
upon obedience. In Britain too we may be sure that the
masses were in the state of semi-serfdom which Caesar
regarded as the condition of the Gallic populace; and that
political power was monopolized by the nobles and the Druids.</p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg271" class="sidenote">Religion.</div>

<p>But, besides improved communication, developed commerce,
and constant intercourse with their Continental kinsmen,
there were other forces making slowly and feebly for
unity,&mdash;common religious ideas and, to some extent,
common ecclesiastical organization. On the other hand we
may suppose that the religious union which existed together
with much diversity was an effect as well as a cause of
political association: when clans found it expedient to combine,
the similar deities of each, which the others had before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
regarded with hatred and jealousy, would tend to become
fused, while those which were peculiar would be worshipped
still.<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">1128</a> Old superstitions of course continued to flourish side
by side with those which the Celtic invaders had brought
with them. The spirits of springs, of lakes, of rivers, of mountains,
and of woods&mdash;of every weird and awesome dell, or
cavern, or rock&mdash;were worshipped in the Iron Age as they
had been for centuries before, and as they continued to be
after what was called Christianity had become the official
creed.<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">1129</a> The <i>Dea Arduinna</i> who hovered over the forest of
the Ardennes and Abnoba, the goddess of the Black Forest,
had their counterparts in Britain. These deities, however,
may have been comparatively recent; for the conception of
a god whose realm was a forest was of course later than that
of the spirit of a single tree.<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">1130</a> Even the terror that impelled
the pristine savage to propitiate demons was not yet dead:
near Newcastle-on-Tyne was erected by some Roman or
Romanized Briton an inscription <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lamiis tribus</i>&mdash;‘to the
Witches three’&mdash;who, it has been truly said, ‘were doubtless
as British as the witches in <cite>Macbeth</cite>’.<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">1131</a> But the cult of
wood and water and the dread of devils are common to all
primitive peoples and to the ignorant among many who are
called civilized;<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">1132</a> and such survivals in Celtic Britain may
well have been common to the pre-Celtic population and to
the Celts who conquered them. Moreover, it is likely
enough that the greater gods whom the Celts worshipped and
who, variously imagined and with various names, were the
common heritage of the Aryan-speaking peoples, were in
part descended from deities who were not Aryan, and were
adored in Britain in a somewhat different spirit before the
first Celt landed on the Kentish shore.<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">1133</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<p>What do we know about those gods? The Celts were
the first inhabitants of Britain about whose religious views
definite information has been handed down to us, as distinct
from what we may infer from sepulchral discoveries and
from ethnography; but it is hardly an exaggeration to say
that of the spirit of their religion we know little more than of
that of the people who built the chambered tombs. Some
five-and-twenty writers, from Timaeus, who wrote three
centuries before the birth of Christ, to Ammianus Marcellinus,
who was contemporary with Julian and Valens, have contributed
to our knowledge; but most of them have left
only a few sentences derived from hearsay or from nameless
authorities of whose credibility we know nothing. They
wrote of Celts who lived in widely distant countries, among
various populations, and at different epochs; and very few
of them referred to the Celts of Britain.<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">1134</a> Supposing that
official Christianity were to become extinct, what could the
historian of the fifth millennium learn of the manifold
doctrines preached by English clergymen if he were obliged
to extract his materials from passages referring to mediaeval
Catholicism, Calvinism, Methodism, or the orthodox faith
which thinly disguises the Shamanism of Russia, and scattered
in the works of writers who began with à Kempis and
ended with Spurgeon? Coins, Gallic and British, in so far
as they are not merely imitative, appear to be fraught with
religious symbolism; but the ingenuity which has spent
itself in the effort to explain the symbols has yielded little
certain result.<a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">1135</a> Geographical names testify to the cult of
various gods without telling us anything of their attributes;
and sometimes we may fancy that we can detect the presence
of divinity when we have only to do with the name of a
Roman <i>gens</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">1136</a> Inscriptions and altars supply names of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
deities which are names and nothing more, or bewilder us
by coupling as surnames with the name of a Roman god
a multiplicity of Celtic gods. Anonymous statues are attributed
to divers deities by divers archaeologists, though
some of them may not be deities at all. Inscriptions, altars,
and statues alike belong to the period of the Roman Empire,
when the introduction of Roman gods and goddesses had
thrown the Celtic pantheon into wellnigh inextricable confusion;
and the monuments of Britain, for the most part,
were apparently the outcome of the devotion either of
Romans or of Gallic, Batavian, Dacian, and other officers of
auxiliaries. Nor can we tell how far British religious ideas
had become estranged from those of Gaul by contact with
aboriginal cults, or how far the religion of the British Goidels
(if indeed they existed) differed from that of the Brythons.
If we turn to the <i>Mabinogion</i>, to the <i>Triads</i>, or to Irish mythology,
we are checked by the reflection, which our foremost
Celticist was forced to make even while he was fascinated
by the quest, that ‘the gulf of ages’ separates ‘the literature
of the Celtic nations of the present day from the narrative
of the writers of antiquity and the testimony of the stones’.<a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">1137</a></p>

<p>Cannot then Caesar help us? His evidence is of course
valuable; but he did not write for the modern student of
religion. Disregarding minor and local deities, perhaps
ignorant of their existence, he recorded the names and
summarized the attributes of the five principal Gallic
gods; but,&mdash;the names are Roman. Mercury&mdash;the inventor
of all arts, the pioneer of communication, the
patron of commerce&mdash;was the most reverenced of all:<a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">1138</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
then follow the names of Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and
Minerva.<a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">1139</a></p>

<p>Now we do not know from whom Caesar derived his information;
but assume that it came from the best authority,
his friend and political agent, the Aeduan Druid, Diviciacus,
who was also an honoured guest of Cicero.<a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">1140</a> Then Caesar was
in the position not of Lafcadio Hearn, who made his home in
Japan, gave his life to the study of all things Japanese, and
at last confessed that the more he tried to learn the more he
realized his ignorance; not of Sir Alfred Lyall, who, prepared
by discriminative reading, devoted all the time that
he could command to the observation of Oriental creeds;
but of some Anglo-Indian administrator who, in his scanty
leisure, should jot down the heads of a conversation with
a Brahmin, and offer them as an outline of Hindu religion.
Only the Anglo-Indian could speak Hindustani; and Caesar
was obliged to employ an interpreter. One of the most
learned and sane of modern Celtic scholars has related that
when the musician, Félicien David, was invited at Cairo by
the viceroy to instruct his wives, etiquette compelled him
to give the lessons to a eunuch, who passed them on as best
he could.<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">1141</a> Caesar, he remarks, was in the position of the
eunuch. And if we could certainly identify the five great
Roman gods with their Gallic counterparts, how much
more of Celtic religion should we know?</p>

<p>But let us learn what we can. Celtic religion, in so far as
it was descended from the religion of the undivided Aryan
stock, was fundamentally one with the religions of Italy and
Greece; and we might expect that it would resemble most
closely the religion of the Italians, to whose tongue Celtic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
was most nearly akin. But our imperfect knowledge of the
classical religions hardly helps us more to understand the
religion of the Celts than the remark of Caesar, that about
their deities ‘they have much the same notions as the rest
of mankind’.<a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">1142</a> For the religion of Rome had been deeply
tinged by contact with the Etruscans and the Greeks, just as
the religion of the Celts had been affected by their fusion
with the aboriginal peoples of Central Europe, Gaul, Spain,
and Britain; and the Celts were in a less advanced state of
civilization than the Romans. What is certain is that, like
every other polytheistic religion, that of the Celts, except
perhaps in so far as it was moulded by Druidical doctrine,
had no definite theology, but was an ever-expanding, ever-shifting,
formless chaos,&mdash;the same in its main developments
in Britain, Gaul, and Spain, yet differing in every tribe and
household, and in every age;<a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">1143</a> that, on its practical side, it
was a performance of traditional rites; that its aim was not
the salvation of souls, but the safety of the state; and that
it concerned the individual most as a member of a family,
a community, or a tribe.<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">1144</a> Like all other polytheists too
the Celts were ready to believe in gods who were not theirs:
in the reign of Tiberius the boatmen of Paris set up an altar
on which, side by side with their own Esus and Tarvos
Trigaranus, were figured Jupiter and Vulcan.<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">1145</a> The theory,
which has been defended with vast if somewhat uncritical
erudition, that the king was regarded as an incarnation of
the sky-god, may possibly be true both of the Celts and of
other Indo-European peoples.<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">1146</a> Perhaps the Celts, like the
Romans, gave more thought to the ritual by which their
gods might be persuaded to grant them their hearts’ desire
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
than to the persons of the gods themselves.<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">1147</a> Doubtless to
the Celt, as to the Roman, however little his religion may
have fostered nobility of life or contrition for sin, dread of
the mysterious was a salutary discipline.<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">1148</a> But what we
want to apprehend is this,&mdash;wherein the spirit of Celtic
religion differed from that of the religion of ancient Latium,
of Greece, of the Semitic tribes; and if the effort is not wholly
vain, we may only hope to attain a distant and hazy view.
He who desires to understand the subject will work at it
for himself. All that I can hope to do is to put him on the
road and to set up a sign-post here and there. The reader
who has absorbed what is valuable in the teaching of Tylor,
Boissier, Lyall, Frazer, Robertson Smith, Reinach, and
Camille Jullian will be best able to discern what is suggested
by the texts and monuments that preserve a few fragments
of Celtic faith.</p>

<p>Why was the god whom Caesar equated with Mercury
honoured above all others by the Continental Celts? Did
the Britons share their devotion? And is Caesar’s statement
confirmed? Some centuries earlier, when the Celts were a
host of warriors, the war-god had been the most conspicuous
figure in their Olympus; and his subsequent inferiority to
Mercury is regarded, perhaps justly, as an indication of
the progress which they had made meantime in the arts
of peace.<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">1149</a> Possibly Lug, the Irish representative of the
Gaulish Lugos, whose name appears in Lugudunum, or
Lyons, in Luguvallum, or Carlisle, and in Lugotorix, a
Kentish chieftain,<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">1150</a> and who in an Irish legend figures as a
carpenter, a smith, a harpist, a poet, and a musician, may
have been the British Mercury;<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">1151</a> but we cannot tell whether
he ranked higher than Mars. Assuming that votive stones
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
in some measure reflect the faith of the native Celts, Mars
was deeply reverenced in Britain. He appears with various
epithets, the names of Celtic deities, one of which, <i>Camulus</i>,
meaning ‘the god of heaven’,<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">1152</a> was commemorated in
Camulodunum, and perhaps bears witness to his former
greatness. It is remarkable, in view of Caesar’s statement,
that in British inscriptions the name of Mercury is far less
common than that of Mars;<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">1153</a> but if the discrepancy is at
all connected with the comparative backwardness of British
civilization, it must also be remembered that the organization
of Britain under Roman rule was military.<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">1154</a> One religious
custom indeed, of which Caesar himself witnessed examples,
proves that Mars, however inferior he may have been to
Mercury, had still many fervent worshippers in Gaul. When
the warriors of a Gallic tribe had made a successful raid, they
used to sacrifice to Mars a portion of the cattle which they
had captured; the rest of their booty they erected in piles
on consecrated ground. It rarely happened that any one
dared to keep back part of the spoil; and the wretch who
defrauded the god was punished, like Achan, by a terrible
death.<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">1155</a> Another British epithet of Mars, Toutates,<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">1156</a> appears
with Esus and Taranis in a famous passage of Lucan,<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">1157</a> where
they stand out as representative deities, in whose honour
dreadful rites were performed. None of the three, save
Esus,<a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">1158</a> is mentioned in Gallic inscriptions, whereas Epona,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
the goddess of equitation, a minor deity, whose statues,
representing a woman riding upon a mare, or seated between
foals, have been found both in France and Britain,<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">1159</a> appears
ten times; and accordingly a distinguished French archaeologist
concludes that they were insignificant objects of local
worship.<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">1160</a> But it is not credible that the devotee who
composed his inscription to Toutates should have unwittingly
ascribed to a mere local god the qualities of Mars. Again,
if Taranis was not one of the greater gods, it is surprising to
find in Britain an inscription in honour of Jupiter Tanarus,<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">1161</a>&mdash;Jove
the Thunderer. Nor is it likely that Lucan should have
learned the names of the trinity whom he made famous
unless their worship had been national.<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">1162</a> But it does not
follow that Tanarus was the Jupiter of the independent
Celts. Tanarus, being the Thunderer, was assimilated to
the Roman Jupiter; and perhaps the Jupiter Tanarus whose
inscription was found at Chester may have been an outcome
of the Roman Jupiter and of a Gallic divinity who is known
as the god of the wheel.<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">1163</a> Statues have been discovered in
France, representing a god with a wheel on his shoulder, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
his hand, or at his feet; and this god was assimilated in
imperial times to Jupiter. Altars on which wheels are
represented have also been found in the north of England;
and miniature wheels of gold, silver, bronze, and lead&mdash;alone,
or forming parts of ornaments or helmets, or stamped on
coins&mdash;have been met with in scores both in France and
England. Probably they had a religious meaning; and it
has been supposed that they are symbolical of sun-worship,
and that the god with the wheel was the god of the sun.<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">1164</a>
Traces of sun-worship are still discernible in the May and
midsummer festivals which are kept up in our own island
and in many European lands.<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">1165</a></p>

<p>Of the other great deities Minerva appears in Irish legend
under the name of Brigit<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">1166</a>, possibly the same goddess as
Brigantia, in whose honour several inscriptions were erected
in Britain,<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">1167</a> although in Gaul, unless perhaps in the name
of the town Brigantium, there is no trace of her worship;<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">1168</a>
while Apollo was assimilated by Roman or Romano-British
devotees sometimes to Maponus, whose name survives in the
familiar Welsh Mabon<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">1169</a>, sometimes to Grannos, in whose
honour an inscription was set up near Edinburgh.<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">1170</a> There
are also vestiges of the cult of a god who resembled Neptune.
At Lydney, on the western bank of the Severn, in the country
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
of the Silures, a temple was built in Roman times to Nodons,
whose name reappears in Welsh legend as <i>Lludd</i> and again in
our Ludgate Hill. The marine scenes which are depicted in
mosaic on the floor seem to show that he was a god of the
sea;<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">1171</a> while the structure of his temple may justify the
conjecture that he was likewise a Jupiter, even as the Italian
Jupiter was god of sea as well as of storm and sky.<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">1172</a> In Gaul
he was unknown; and an eminent Celticist has assumed
that he was peculiar to the Goidelic Celts.<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">1173</a> On the other
hand, Toutates, Taranis, Epona, and Belisama were apparently
unknown on Goidelic soil.<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">1174</a> But it profits little to
dispute about names. It does not follow that the Goidels
did not recognize somewhat similar deities akin to these;
and Belisama was simply the goddess who in Roman Gaul
was identified with Minerva.<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">1175</a></p>

<p>Caesar, in a familiar passage,<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">1176</a> tells us that the Gauls
regarded themselves as descendants of Dis Pater, who was
conspicuous in the old Latin pantheon as the god of the
dead, although in Caesar’s time he had been dethroned by
the Pluto who was imported from Greece.<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">1177</a> Several Gallo-Roman
images, the best known of which is on an altar
discovered at Sarrebourg,<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">1178</a> represent a god with a hammer:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
a bronze statue of the same deity has been found in England;<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">1179</a>
and eminent French archaeologists believe that this was no
other than Dis Pater.<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">1180</a></p>

<p>But we must not imagine that these gods had always been
distinct, or even that in Caesar’s time their physiognomies
were sharply outlined. When we see that the Germans
whom he encountered worshipped Sun, Moon, and Fire,<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">1181</a>
and that those whom Tacitus described had their Mars and
Mercury,<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">1182</a> we may be inclined to suspect that Celtic ideas,
under classical influence, had undergone a like transformation.<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">1183</a>
In polytheism divers attributes of deity tend to become
separate deities.<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">1184</a> Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus were,
it would seem, only specialized forms of the same god;<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">1185</a> and
some of the Celtic epithets which are attached to Minerva,
Mars, and the rest may mean that they were assimilated by
this or that tribe to topical divinities.<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">1186</a> Dis Pater was
certainly near of kin to Saturn,&mdash;that old Italian chthonian
divinity;<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">1187</a> and Dis Pater and Toutates, ‘the god of the
people,’ who was perhaps primarily conceived as a kind of
Saturn,<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">1188</a> may once have been one; indeed there seem to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
indications that from one point of view Dis Pater was
Jupiter,&mdash;a Jupiter of the nether world.<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">1189</a> Again, if Toutates
in Britain remained Mars, while in Gaul the Romanized
Celts seem to have hesitated whether to identify him with
Mars or Mercury, one is tempted to conjecture that he may
have been the common ancestor of both.<a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">1190</a></p>

<p>No deities were nearer to the hearts of Celtic peasants
than those who were known as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deae matres</i>,&mdash;the mother
goddesses. Once they were thought to belong to Germans
and Celts alone;<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">1191</a> but their statues have been found in
numbers at Capua; and, slightly modified, they survived
into the Middle Age. Generally figured in groups of three&mdash;a
mystic number<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">1192</a>&mdash;their aspect was that of gentle serious
motherly women, holding new-born infants in their hands,
or bearing fruits and flowers in their laps; and many offerings
were made to them by country folk in gratitude for their
care of farm and flock and home.<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">1193</a></p>

<p>Besides the gods whose cult was common to all the Celtic
peoples or to one or the other of the two great stocks were
local deities innumerable. We know that the Gallic cities,
Bibracte<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">1194</a> and Lugudunum,<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">1195</a> had their divine patrons; and
it is probable that every British town had its eponymous
hero.<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">1196</a> The deities, however, from whom towns derived their
names were doubtless often worshipped near the site long
before the first foundations were laid: the goddess Bibracte
was originally the spirit of a spring reverenced by the
peasants of the mountain upon which the famous Aeduan
town was built.<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">1197</a> Perhaps we shall not err if we also suppose
that the heads of his slain enemies, which the Celtic brave
religiously treasured and fastened upon the walls of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
cottage, were offered to his household gods or to the spirits
of his ancestors.<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">1198</a></p>

<p>The worship of animals, to those who have not felt the
fascination of anthropology, appears merely unintelligible
and absurd. Animals were worshipped because they were
formidable or wonderful; because men fancied that they
were incarnations of deity; because they might be tenanted
by the souls of heroic forefathers;<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">1199</a> and animal-worship, or
a relic of animal-worship, which may perhaps, in some cases,
have been a survival of totemism, has left vestiges in Celtic
art. The boar was especially sacred. Bronze figures of
boars have been found alone and on the crests of helmets:
the Witham shield, as we have seen, was decorated with the
figure of a boar; and so are numerous coins, both Gallic
and British.<a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">1200</a> Like the Romans, the Gauls and doubtless
also the Britons had military standards: like the Romans
also, they carried not a flag but the figure of an animal, and
with them this animal was always the boar.<a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">1201</a> A reminiscence
of animal-worship is probably also discernible in the
horned head of Cernunnos, a god who is figured on one of
the well-known altars of Paris, and in Tarvos Trigaranus&mdash;‘the
bull with the three cranes’&mdash;which fills the back of
another.<a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">1202</a></p>

<p>But votive altars, statues, and temples, although they
embodied older beliefs, belong, as we have seen, to the
period when the Celts had fallen under the dominion of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
Rome. The Cisalpine Gauls, if Livy<a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">1203</a> and Polybius<a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">1204</a> are
to be believed, worshipped in temples: but the holy places
of the Western Celts were groves,<a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">1205</a> and perhaps stone circles
which they inherited from the people of the Bronze Age.
Such simplicity was of course not peculiar to the Celts and
the Germans.<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">1206</a> The Pelasgian Zeus had no temple: the
oldest sanctuary of Jupiter on the Alban Mount was a grove
of oaks.<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">1207</a> Not a single statue of pre-Roman date has ever
been found in Britain; not one in Gaul later than the close
of the Palaeolithic Age. Caesar indeed says that the Gallic
Mercury was represented by numerous <i>simulacra</i>; but if
these were statues, it is inexplicable that none of them has
ever come to light; and perhaps we may accept the suggestion
that Caesar was thinking of menhirs, which had been
erected long before the first Celt set foot in Gaul,<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">1208</a> but which,
like the formless stones that the Greeks venerated as figures
of Hermes,<a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">1209</a> were, he supposed, regarded as possessed by
the spirit of the great national deity. On the menhir of
Kernuz in Finistère a rude Mercury was sculptured in Roman
times.<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">1210</a> The conjecture may be well founded that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
Druids, like the priests of Israel, were opposed to anthropomorphism;<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">1211</a>
but it is not needed to explain the lack of
native statues of Celtic gods.<a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">1212</a> The Romans, according to
Varro, had for many years no sacred images:<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">1213</a> like the
Celts, like the Germans, who also, even in the time of Tacitus,<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">1214</a>
deemed it derogatory to the majesty of the gods to ascribe to
them human form, they were content to recognize manifestations
of divine will; and even when their temples were
being crowded with the works of Greek art, their ancient
Vesta remained shrouded in awful mystery.<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">1215</a> But, while the
Druids may have been as hostile as Israel to Gentile abominations,
the Celts in general were as receptive as the Romans,
and readily accepted the services of foreign sculptors.</p>

<p>The evidence of interments, from which we tried to glean
some information as to the religion of the Bronze Age,
remains much the same during the later period; and the
noticeable changes do not seem to have much significance.
British customs differed somewhat from those of Gaul.
Inhumation, which had almost entirely ceased in that
country in the second century before Christ, continued everywhere
in Britain except in the territory of the Belgae; and
even there cremation was not universal.<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">1216</a> In the more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
southern districts nearly all the interments which have been
explored were unmarked by any tumulus; while in the
cemetery of Aylesford the urns which contained the cremated
remains were placed in small cylindrical pits set in what
has been described as a family circle.<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">1217</a> When barrows were
erected their form was still circular: but they were generally
much smaller than those of the Bronze Age: they were
grouped in much greater numbers;<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">1218</a> and they were never
more than structureless heaps of earth or stone.<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">1219</a> Although
the contracted position was still common, skeletons have
been found extended in this country, as generally in Gaul;<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">1220</a>
and, as in Wiltshire in the Bronze Age, the head generally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
pointed towards the north.<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">1221</a> On the other hand, ornaments
and weapons were placed in graves more frequently than
before:<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">1222</a> animals were still occasionally interred;<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">1223</a> and
flint chips and stones were still sometimes deposited in or
along with urns.<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">1224</a> But rites which in the Bronze Age could
only be inferred are attested in the Iron Age by eye-witnesses.
We learn from Caesar<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">1225</a> that it was a custom of the Gauls to
immolate the dead man’s cherished possessions, even his
favourite animals, on the funeral pyre; and that not long
before the time of his oldest contemporaries slaves and
retainers had been sacrificed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_44" src="images/fig_44.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span></p></div>

<p>The most remarkable perhaps of the sepulchral discoveries
that illustrate this period appears to show that old persisted
along with new. Hard by the family circles of the Aylesford
cemetery, Dr. Arthur Evans opened three cists, each containing
a contracted skeleton, the upper slab of one being
pierced with a hole which may perhaps have been intended
to let the ghost escape;<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">1226</a> while almost side by side with
elegant Late Celtic vases he picked up fragments of the old-fashioned
finger-dented ware, including a drinking-cup and
a cinerary urn.<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">1227</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<div id="PI_CV_Pg289" class="sidenote">The
Druids.</div>

<p>It would be interesting to learn whether any Celtic prophet,
like the great preachers of India and Palestine, taught that
mercy is better than sacrifice. If we may trust Diogenes
Laertius,<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">1228</a> the Druids bade their disciples not only to fear the
gods, but to do no wrong and to quit themselves like men.
At all events the study of Celtic religion is inseparable from
that of Druidism.</p>

<p>Where did Druidism originate? Caesar, in a well-known
passage, remarks that it was believed to have arisen in Britain
and to have been imported thence into Gaul;<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">1229</a> and some
scholars accept this tradition as literally true. The earliest
extant mention of Druids<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">1230</a> was made about the commencement
of the second century before Christ,&mdash;not long after
the Belgic conquest of Britain began; and it has been supposed
that the conquerors found Druidism flourishing there,
and made it known in the land from which they had set out.
But the Belgae were not the first Celtic conquerors of Britain;
and it is reasonable to suppose that if Druidism was of British
origin, it would have been imported into Gaul long before.
The common view is that on both sides of the Channel it
originated among the neolithic population; and Caesar’s
words are sometimes explained in the sense that in his time
it was more vigorous in Britain than in Gaul, and that
Gallic Druids therefore travelled to Britain in order to be
initiated into its mysteries. At all events it is not unreasonable
to believe that the Celts learned it from some non-Aryan
people; for there is nothing to show that the Gauls whom
the Romans first encountered had ever heard of it. The
Germans, with whom the Celts were long in contact in
Central Europe and to whom they were ethnically akin, had
no Druids;<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">1231</a> and although it may be true that the intense
devotion to religious observances which Caesar remarked
among the mixed population of Gaul<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">1232</a> did not exceed that of
other barbarians,<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">1233</a> it appeared to him to contrast sharply
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
with the temper of the peoples beyond the Rhine.<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">1234</a> This
spirit led them to connect religion with every act of life: in
the chase,<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">1235</a> in all the operations of war, after victory or
defeat, before undertaking an expedition, in selecting the
site of a town, the gods were regularly invoked:<a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">1236</a> there was
no distinction between the sacred and the profane; or
rather, nothing was profane. The contrast which Caesar
observed supports the theory of the non-Aryan origin of
Druidism.</p>

<p>But was Druidism in Britain universal? The leading
Celtic scholar of this country insists that there is no evidence
that Druidism was ever the religion of any Brythonic people;<a id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">1237</a>
and since he assigns almost the whole of Britain south of the
firths of Forth and Clyde to the Brythons, he appears to
restrict the area of Druidism to a narrow western fringe.
This hardly accords with Caesar’s statement that Britain
was the stronghold of Druidism. Moreover, when Caesar
tells us that the Druids were the religious aristocracy of the
Gauls, he plainly gives us to understand that Druidism was
common to all the peoples who lived between the Seine and
the Garonne; and it is certain that among many if not
most of these peoples the Gallo-Brythonic element was
predominant. Indeed, although it is commonly assumed
that the Belgae had no Druids, there is absolutely no ground
for the assumption. Caesar often used the word <i>Galli</i> in
a wider sense, including the Belgae; and it is not improbable
that when he was describing the manners and customs of the
Gauls and Druidism, which was their most remarkable
institution, he intended his description to apply to the
Belgae as well.<a id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">1238</a> Moreover, the very writer who denies that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
the Brythons had Druids tells us that Druidism was the
religion of the British aborigines and was borrowed from
them by the British Goidels; and it is certain that both the
aborigines and the Goidels (if they had already reached
Britain) survived in considerable numbers in the territory
which the Brythons conquered.<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">1239</a> It is clear therefore that
Druidism persisted within the Brythonic area; and that
the Brythons held aloof from it is a groundless guess.<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">1240</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span></p>

<p>But concerning Druidism as it existed in Britain we have
no special information, except the passage in which Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">1241</a>
speaks of the cruel rites practised by the Druids of Anglesey.
Caesar described Druidism once for all;<a id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">1242</a> and since he says
that British Druidism was the model and the standard of
the Gallic Druids, we can only infer that his description
applied in many respects to Britain as well as to Gaul.
There the Druids formed a corporation, admission to which
was eagerly sought: they jealously guarded the secrecy of
their lore; and full membership was only obtainable after
a long novitiate. They were ruled by a pope, who held
office for life; and sometimes the succession to this dignity
was disputed by force of arms. They were exempt from
taxation and from service in war. They had, as the priests
of a rude society always have, a monopoly of learning. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
ignorance and superstition of the populace, their own
organization and submission to one head, gave them a
tremendous power. The doctrine which they most strenuously
inculcated (if Caesar was not misinformed) was the
transmigration of souls. ‘This doctrine,’ he said, ‘they
regard as the most potent incentive to valour, because it
inspires a contempt for death.’<a id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">1243</a> They claimed the right of
deciding questions of peace and war. Among the Aedui, if
not among other peoples, at all events in certain circumstances,
they exercised the right of appointing the chief
magistrate.<a id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">1244</a> They laid hands on criminals and, in their
default, even on the innocent, imprisoned them in monstrous
idols of wickerwork, and burned them alive as an offering
to the gods. They immolated captives in order to discover
the divine will in the flow of their blood or their palpitating
entrails;<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">1245</a> they lent their ministrations to men prostrated
by sickness or going forth to battle, who trusted that heaven
would spare their lives if human victims were offered in their
stead; and one form of human sacrifice which they appear
to have countenanced&mdash;the slaughter of a child at the
foundation of a monument, a fortress, or a bridge&mdash;has left
many traces in European folk-lore and been practised in
Africa, Asia, and Polynesia in modern times.<a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">1246</a> They practically
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
monopolized both the civil and the criminal jurisdiction;<a id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">1247</a>
and if this jurisdiction was irregular, if they had
no legal power of enforcing their judgements, they were none
the less obeyed. Primitive states did not originally take
cognizance of offences committed against individuals, which
were avenged by their kin; and when they began to intervene
they did so at the request of the injured party or his
surviving relatives. What was peculiar to the Celts was that
this intervention was exercised by the priests;<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">1248</a> and doubtless
the outlaws who, as Caesar says,<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">1249</a> abounded in Gaul
were criminals whom they had banished. Every year they
met to dispense civil justice in the great plain above which
now soar the spires of Chartres cathedral.<a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">1250</a> Those who
disregarded their decrees were excommunicated; and excommunication
meant exclusion from the civil community
as well as from communion in religious rites.</p>

<p>Did the Druids owe their conception of immortality, as
Diodorus Siculus<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">1251</a> and Timagenes<a id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">1252</a> imply, to the influence of
Pythagoras? The testimony of these writers has been contemptuously
rejected:<a id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">1253</a> but it seems not improbable that
Druidism may have absorbed tenets of Pythagorean origin
through the medium of the Greeks of Massilia;<a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">1254</a> and this
conjecture gains some support from numismatic evidence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
A British uninscribed gold coin, found at Reculver, bears on
its reverse side the figure, formed by five interlacing lines,
which is known as the pentagram and was a well-known
Pythagorean symbol.<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">1255</a> It would seem, however, that if
metempsychosis was really a Druidical doctrine, it had no
firm hold upon the Celts in general; and their sepulchral
customs were not consistent with it. Their notion of a future
life, like that of the Bronze Age, was a form of the ‘Continuance
Theory’, which has had so many adherents both in
primitive and modern tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">1256</a> They believed that there
was an Elysium somewhere in the west, where they were
to live again, feasting, carousing, and duelling, a life like
that which they had lived before, but free from care.<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">1257</a> If
the Druids, as Caesar said, taught that souls passed ‘from
one person to another’, they meant perhaps that after death
the soul entered a new body,&mdash;the ethereal counterpart of
that which it had left behind. The immortality of the soul
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
was an idea, more or less vague, common to many peoples:
for the Celts the Druids made it an article of faith. Nor
indeed are we precluded from supposing that some of them
may have conceived or borrowed from a classic source the
doctrine of future retribution. But what that theory was
which, as Caesar says<a id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">1258</a>, the Druids inculcated in regard to
the origin of the universe and the nature and motion of the
heavenly bodies, it is useless to inquire<a id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">1259</a>. We only know
that, as they traced the descent of the Gauls back to Dis
Pater, they regarded night as older than day, and reckoned
time by nights; and that, in common with all the peoples of
antiquity, they computed their years by the revolutions of
the moon<a id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">1260</a>. The statements of Caesar and Pliny are supplemented
by a calendar, engraved on bronze, which was
discovered towards the end of the last century at Coligny in
the department of the Ain<a id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">1261</a>. It has its lucky and unlucky
days; certain days would be regarded as suitable for sacrifices
as well as for other functions<a id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">1262</a>; and the regulation of
these important matters would certainly have been retained
by the Druids. It has been said, perhaps in reliance upon
a mistranslation of the word <i>dryas</i> or <i>druias</i>, that Druidesses
taught side by side with Druids<a id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">1263</a>: at all events Boadicea
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
sought to divine the issue of her campaign by observing the
movements of a hare, besought the gods to bless her enterprise,
and after her success offered female captives to
Andate, the goddess of victory;<a id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">1264</a> and her joint exercise of
royal and priestly functions seems to give colour to the
suggestion that in primitive times Celtic kings may also
have been priests.<a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">1265</a> Cicero<a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">1266</a> indeed relates that the Galatian
King, Deiotarus, was the most skilful augur of his country.
But the facts of historical import which stand out as certain
are these. Like the Brahmans, who, so long as their
authority is acknowledged, recognize, but regulate, the
Protean manifestations of Hindu religious fancy,<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">1267</a> the
Druids kept control over the manifold forms of aboriginal
and Celtic worship. Being a sacerdotal caste, not, like the
priests of Rome, popularly elected, but self-constituted and
self-contained, they were naturally opposed to all innovation.
It has been said that ancient writers regarded as peculiar to
the Druids beliefs and practices which were common to
them and other priests of antiquity. Certainly human
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
sacrifice was not peculiar to the Celts: the ceremony of
cutting the mysterious mistletoe was German as well as
Druidical;<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">1268</a> and as the Druid sacrificed white bulls before
he ascended the sacred oak,<a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">1269</a> so did the Latin priest in the
grove which was the holy place of Jupiter.<a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">1270</a> But while every
ancient people had its priests, the Druids alone were a
veritable clergy.<a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">1271</a> Celtic religion, in so far as it had the
same ancestry as that of Rome, would easily harmonize
with it; but Druidism, with its more definite theology,
might be expected to counteract this tendency, and would
therefore be a danger to Roman dominion.<a id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">1272</a> And it was
British Druidism that supported and renovated the Druidism
of Gaul, and formed one of the bonds of union between the
two Celtic lands.<a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">1273</a>

<p>For, if their material culture was somewhat less advanced,
the Britons, at least those of the south-eastern districts,
naturally remained connected by the closest ties with the
Gauls, and particularly with the Belgae. The Britons of
Kent were little less civilized than the Gauls;<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">1274</a> and Belgic
kings, like William the Conqueror and his descendants, ruled
on both sides of the Channel.<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">1275</a> Not many years before the
period of the Gallic wars, Diviciacus, king of the Suessiones,
who governed directly the country round Soissons, had
established supremacy not only over a large part of the
surrounding Belgic territory but also over Britain;<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">1276</a> and
during a period which may have coincided with his reign
gold coins of certain types were used indifferently in the
Belgic districts of Britain and of Gaul, and were doubtless
struck for rulers who had possessions in both.<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">1277</a> But the power
of Diviciacus had ended with him;<a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">1278</a> and when Caesar came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
to Gaul, the tribes of South-Eastern Britain were divided into
antagonistic groups, headed respectively by the Catuvellauni
and the Trinovantes. Cassivellaunus, the king of the Catuvellauni,
was the ablest and most aggressive of the British
princes of his time; but his opponents were supported, it
would seem, by the influence of Commius, a chieftain of
the Belgic Atrebates, whose territory comprised adjacent
districts of the departments of Pas-de-Calais and Nord, and
who were connected with the British tribe of the same name.</p>

<p>But, if anything could induce the Britons to forget their

movements in Gaul. The events of the first year of his pro-consulship&mdash;the
overthrow of the Helvetii, who had migrated
into Gaul from Switzerland, and the defeat of the German
invader, Ariovistus&mdash;might not affect their interests: but
in the following year, when the Belgae banded together
against the Roman conqueror, it was time for them to be on
the alert. British adventurers crossed the Straits to assist
their kinsmen; and when Caesar shattered the forces of the
coalition, the leaders of at least one Belgic tribe fled over
sea to escape his vengeance. Late in the autumn of that
year or early in the following spring rumours reached the
ports of the Channel that Caesar purposed to invade Britain.

<h3 id="CAESARS_FIRST_INVASION_OF_BRITAIN_301">CAESAR’S FIRST INVASION OF BRITAIN</h3>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg301a" class="sidenote">Caesar
obliged
to secure
his rear
before invading
Britain.</div>

<p>Before Caesar could venture to undertake so difficult
an enterprise as the invasion of Britain, it was necessary for
him to secure the country in his rear. His first two campaigns
had been directed against enemies who were as
dangerous to Gaul as to Rome. Cavalry levied from friendly
Gallic tribes fought side by side with the Roman legions
against the Helvetii and against Ariovistus: after the defeat
of the Helvetii envoys came from all the tribes of Central and
Eastern Gaul to congratulate the victor; and after the defeat
of Ariovistus the legions took up their quarters for the
winter in Gallic territory without resistance. There was
probably not a single tribe in which Caesar had not opponents:
but the prestige of Rome and of his own victories,
the factious spirit and the intertribal jealousies of the Gauls,
and above all the sagacity with which he played off party
against party, and selected the chiefs who, for their own
purposes, were able and willing to serve him, prevented
open opposition. Thus, although the seeds of future troubles
were even then germinating, he could safely use Celtican
Gaul as his base of operations when he crossed the Marne in
the following year to encounter the Belgae. The series of
victories which he gained in this campaign intimidated his
opponents for the time and increased his renown, but had
little effect upon the remote maritime tribe of the Morini, on
whose coast was the harbour from which he must sail.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg301b" class="sidenote">He contemplated
invasion as early as
56 <small>B.C.</small></div>

<p>Caesar’s first mention of Britain occurs in the chapter that
follows his narrative of the operations by which
he destroyed the invading hordes of the Usipetes and Tencteri,
crossed the Rhine, and chastised the tribe which had given
an asylum to their fugitives:&mdash;‘Only a small part of the
summer remained; and in these parts, the whole of Gaul
having a northerly trend, winter sets in early: nevertheless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
<span id="PI_CVI_Pg302" class="sidenote">56 <small>B.C.</small></span>
Caesar made active preparations for an expedition to
Britain; for he knew that in almost all the operations in
Gaul our enemies had been reinforced from that country.’<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">1279</a>
But even if we had not Strabo’s explicit statement, it would
be unnecessary to argue that Caesar could not have undertaken
so momentous an enterprise upon the spur of the
moment. Strabo says that the Veneti, who in 56 <small>B.C.</small> formed
a coalition of the maritime tribes of North-Western and
Northern Gaul against Caesar, made war upon him because
they were determined to prevent him from invading Britain,
the trade with which was in their hands.<a id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">1280</a> The statement is
intrinsically probable, and is supported by facts for which
we have the authority of Caesar himself. The alliance
which the Veneti headed included almost all the maritime
tribes between the Loire and the Rhine; and auxiliaries
actually came from Britain to join them. It is not credible
that the Britons would have crossed the widest part of the
Channel, or that the Morini, whose country lay between the
Somme and the Scheldt, and the Menapii, whose seaboard
reached the Rhine, would have supported the remote Veneti,
if they had not had reason to believe that their own interests
were imperilled. Moreover, Caesar tells us that among the
ships which he assembled for the invasion of Britain were
galleys which he had used in the naval action with the
Veneti. This action took place off the coast of the Morbihan,
the nearest harbour to which was in the estuary of the Loire;<a id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">1281</a>
and it is needless to argue that the galleys were not there
when Caesar sent for them. If only ‘a small part of the
summer’ remained when he began to prepare for the invasion,
there was no time for his messengers to travel from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
neighbourhood of Coblenz, where he had crossed and recrossed
the Rhine, to the mouth of the Loire, or for the galleys to
make the voyage of six hundred miles from the Loire to the
north-eastern coast of Gaul. When Caesar’s messengers
set out, the galleys must have been within a short distance
of the port from which he set sail,&mdash;probably in the mouth
<span id="PI_CVI_Pg303" class="sidenote">Campaign against the Veneti necessary in order
to secure command of the Channel.</span>
of the Seine or of the Somme. The war which he waged
against the Veneti was a necessary prelude to the invasion
of Britain. For he could not safely embark his army unless
he had command of the Channel; and at the time when he
planned the invasion the masters of the Channel were the
Veneti. They had a powerful fleet of large vessels, the
model of which had, we may suppose, been originally borrowed
from that of the merchantmen of the Carthaginians,
whose commerce in the Atlantic and in British waters they
had inherited. This fleet enabled them to close the ports
not only of their own territory in Western Brittany, but also
of the western seaboard at least of Northern Gaul; and no
one was permitted to use those ports except on condition
of paying them toll.</p>

<div class="sidenote">57 <small>B.C.</small></div>

<p>But Caesar attempted to gain his object without fighting.
After his campaign against the Belgae he sent the 7th
legion under Publius Crassus, the younger son of the wealthy
triumvir, to winter in the valley of the lower Loire; and all
the tribes of Brittany submitted to him and gave him
hostages. It was probably about this time that Crassus
made his celebrated voyage to the tin-producing districts
of Cornwall;<a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">1282</a> and it seems not unreasonable to conjecture
that it was the news of his mission which gave the alarm to
the Veneti. They arrested two officers whom he had sent
to make a requisition of corn: the other maritime tribes of
Brittany and Normandy threw in their lot with them; and
an embassy was sent to Crassus to demand the restoration
of the hostages. Messengers were promptly dispatched to
inform Caesar, who had gone to Illyricum. He sent orders
to Crassus to have a fleet of war-galleys built in the estuary
<span class="sidenote">56 <small>B.C.</small></span>
of the Loire, to summon oarsmen from the Roman Province
of Southern Gaul, and to impress seamen and pilots. Meanwhile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
the Veneti were engaging fresh allies, and reinforcements
were hastening from Britain to join them. The allied
fleet was speedily assembled on the coast of the Morbihan.
Caesar hurried back to join his army, and on his arrival made
all the necessary dispositions for preventing the spread of
the insurrectionary movement. Crassus was dispatched
southward into the country of the Aquitani, from whom, it
is true, little danger was to be expected: another general,
Titurius Sabinus, was sent northward into the peninsula of
the Cotentin, to prevent the tribes of Northern Brittany and
Western Normandy from joining the Veneti; and Labienus,
Caesar’s most capable lieutenant, marched eastward through
the heart of Gaul to the neighbourhood of Treves, with orders
to watch the Belgae and repel the German tribes, who were
believed to be in communication with the Gauls, in case they
attempted to cross the Rhine. Labienus appears to have
had little trouble; but Crassus and Sabinus encountered
and defeated their respective enemies. Caesar himself
invaded Venetia, and entrusted Decimus Brutus with the
command of his fleet. During a great part of the summer
Brutus was detained in the mouth of the Loire by stormy
weather; and Caesar spent the time in endeavouring to
reduce the strongholds on the Venetian coast. These
operations were fruitless; but on the first fine day the
struggle was brought to an issue. The decisive battle was
fought in Quiberon Bay.<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">1283</a> The allied fleet numbered two
hundred and twenty sail, while the Roman galleys were reinforced
by ships lent by friendly tribes who inhabited the
maritime districts south of the Loire. The ships of the Veneti
and their allies were so heavy and so stoutly built that it
would have been useless for the galleys to attempt to ram
them; and they stood so high out of the water that the
legionaries were unable to throw missiles with effect. But
the Roman engineers came to the rescue as they had done
in the First Punic War. Long poles had been prepared,
armed at one end with sharp-edged hooks. The galleys
swifter and more mobile than the Gallic ships, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
had no oars.<a id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">1284</a> When the fleets approached each other, two
or more galleys ran alongside one of the enemy’s ships; and
the halyards were seized by the hooks. Instantly the rowers
pulled away: the halyards snapped, and yards and sails
fell down, leaving the helpless hulk to be boarded by the
legionaries. ‘Thenceforward,’ wrote Caesar, ‘the fight
turned upon valour, in which our soldiers easily had the
advantage.’<a id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">1285</a> When several ships had been captured, the
Veneti abandoned the fight and made haste to escape. But
their ships had hardly been put before the wind when they
were becalmed; and the galleys, running swiftly in and
out among them, captured them one after another, all but
a few which contrived to reach land when darkness fell.</p>

<p class="caption">SOUTH EASTERN BRITAIN<br />
<a href="#note_xvi"><i>See note on page XVI.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>The Veneti surrendered unconditionally. Caesar was
determined to teach the Gauls that ‘the rights of envoys’<a id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">1286</a>
must be respected in future. The Venetian senate were put
to death; and all the tribesmen who failed to escape were
sold into slavery.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg305a" class="sidenote">Campaign
against
the Morini.</div>

<p>It remained only to subdue the Morini, who had never
yet acknowledged the supremacy of Rome. Caesar marched
against them: but the season was too far advanced; and
he found it impossible to strike a decisive blow. The
Morini would not risk a battle, and took refuge in their
forests. Caesar allowed himself to be surprised on the
outskirts and lost a few men, though he succeeded in punishing
his assailants; and after the legions had spent some
days in cutting down trees, capturing baggage, and driving
off cattle, stormy weather set in, and rain fell so heavily and
continuously that they could no longer live safely in tents,
<span id="PI_CVI_Pg305b" class="sidenote">Its failure leaves Caesar’s base not quite secure.</span>
and were forced to abandon the campaign. Owing to this
failure, which Caesar hardly atoned for by ravaging the
cultivated lands as he retreated, the base of operations for
the expedition which was to take place in the following
year was still insecure. On the other hand, the maritime
tribes between the Somme and the Pyrenees were effectually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
subdued; and Caesar was absolute master of the
sea.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg306" class="sidenote">55 <small>B.C.</small>
Caesar determines
to sail from
the Portus
Itius
(Boulogne.)</div>

<p>When the campaign of the following year against the
Germans was over, Caesar marched westward into the
country of the Morini, ‘because,’ as he tells us, ‘the shortest
passage to Britain was from their coast.’<a id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">1287</a> Probably he had
already ascertained what was the best port to sail from; but
any competent cavalry officer could have procured the information
in a couple of days. Between the Scheldt and the
Somme there was only one harbour which would satisfy all
his requirements. Calais did not then exist: Sangatte, on
the east of Cape Blancnez, was at best a mere roadstead;
and the sandy waste between Cape Blancnez and Cape
Grisnez, from which the village of Wissant derives its name,
though it possessed two tiny creeks formed by rivulets,
offered no shelter for a fleet and no facilities for building or
repairing ships, or for provisioning an army. The Canche,
the Authie, and the Somme, if at that time they were used
as harbours, were too far from Britain. But the estuary of
the Liane, on whose right bank stood Gesoriacum, the
village whose site is now covered by Boulogne, combined
every advantage. Caesar, Latinizing its Celtic name&mdash;the
port of Icht, or ‘the Channel harbour’&mdash;called it the Portus
Itius. Gallic merchants sailed from it to the ports of Kent:
from the time of Augustus it was the Roman port of embarkation
for Britain, and at a later period the naval station of the
Roman Channel Fleet. The estuary, longer, wider, and
deeper than it is now, was protected from every gale by the
bold bluff of land which on the west throws out the promontory
of Alprech, and which then projected northward considerably
beyond its present limit.<a id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">1288</a> Vessels of light draught
could enter the harbour at low tide. Shipyards lined its
banks. Roads connected it with the interior; and timber
in abundance could be floated down the river from the forest
of Boulogne. The heights that look down from the east
upon the harbour, about half a mile south of the column
which commemorates the assemblage of Napoleon’s ‘Grand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
Army’, offered an excellent site for the encampment of the
force that was destined to protect the communications; and
perhaps a detachment may have been posted on the opposite
bank of the river.<a id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">1289</a> If the distance in a straight line to
Britain was a little longer than from the creeks of Wissant,
the passage, owing to the set of the tidal streams and the
prevalence of south-westerly winds, was more convenient.
Caesar therefore gave orders that vessels should be collected
from the adjacent coasts, and assemble, along with the
galleys which had been docked after the war with the
Veneti, in the Portus Itius.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg307" class="sidenote">He attempts
to
obtain
information
about
Britain
from Gallic
traders.</div>

<p>The summer was now far advanced; and Caesar saw
his first expedition must be a mere reconnaissance:
but, as he tells us, ‘he thought that it would be well worth
his while merely to visit the island, see what the people were
like, and make himself acquainted with the features of the
country, the harbours, and the landing-places.’<a id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">1290</a> Though
on a clear day he could see beyond the straits those ‘astonishing
masses of cliff’ which haunted the imagination of
Cicero,<a id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">1291</a> he was about to venture into an unknown land.
The Italians of that time knew hardly anything of the
island which they vaguely regarded as the end of the
inhabited world, except that it produced tin, some of which
found its way to the markets of the Mediterranean.<a id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">1292</a> Perhaps
Cicero and other cultivated men had read extracts from the
journal of Pytheas: but Pytheas was a discredited writer;
and, after all, his description of the Britons who lived in
the time of Alexander the Great would have been little
more useful to Caesar than Bernier’s account of the empire
of Aurangzeb would be to a traveller who intended to spend
a winter in India. Caesar sent for traders from all parts of
North-Eastern Gaul, and questioned them about the island:&mdash;How
large was it? What tribes inhabited it? What were
their methods of fighting, their manners and customs?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
What ports were capable of accommodating a large fleet?
He failed to obtain the information which he required.
Many commentators have insisted that the traders could
have told him all that he wanted to know; and certainly it
seems difficult to understand how they could have professed
ignorance of the harbours without manifest contumacy:
but at least as regards the other questions, the reason which
Caesar assigns for their silence is sufficient:&mdash;‘even they
know nothing of Britain except the coast and the parts
opposite the various regions of Gaul.’<a id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">1293</a> Moreover, it must
be remembered that Caesar asked them what harbours could
shelter a large fleet; and as they were only acquainted with
the harbours of Kent, none of which would fulfil this requirement,
it is quite intelligible that even on this point they
should have been unable to enlighten him. Still, they
could have given valuable information about the Kentish
coast; and the passage in which Strabo accounts for the
hostility of the Veneti suggests that they kept silence from
interested motives.<a id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">1294</a> They could not foresee that Caesar’s
expeditions would powerfully stimulate British trade.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg308a" class="sidenote">Gaius
Volusenus

opposite
coast.</div>

<p>Thrown back upon his own resources, Caesar sent a
military tribune, named Gaius Volusenus, in a galley to
reconnoitre the opposite coast. Volusenus had distinguished
himself in a campaign, conducted by one of Caesar’s generals,
against the mountaineers of the upper Rhône: he possessed,
as his later history proved, not merely a keen eye for the
features of a country, but daring of that kind which characterized
the sons of Zeruiah; and how highly Caesar thought
of him is evident from the fact that he was the only military
tribune whose name is mentioned with honour in the <cite>Commentaries</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">1295</a></p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg308b" class="sidenote">Envoys

<p>All this time trade was going on as usual between Gaul
and Britain; and Gallic merchants had informed their
clients in Kent that the long-expected invasion was about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
<span  class="sidenote">55 <small>B.C.</small></span>
to take place. While Volusenus was cruising in the Straits
of Dover a ship with envoys from various British tribes on
board sailed into the Liane. Presenting themselves in
Caesar’s camp, they announced that their principals were
prepared to submit to the Roman People and to give hostages.
Caesar received them courteously, exhorted them to adhere
to their resolve, and dismissed them. But they were not to
return alone. Two years before, during the campaign
against the Belgae, Caesar had gained over Commius, whose
connexion with Britain<a id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">1296</a> he had perhaps already ascertained,
and, in accordance with the policy which he often followed,
had established him as king over the Atrebates. He had
doubtless learned much from him about British politics, and
had concluded that, just as in Gaul he had taken advantage
of tribal disputes and had found it politic to support the
Aedui and the Remi against their rivals, so in Britain his
best course would be to side with the Trinovantes against
the aggressive Catuvellauni. He had formed a high opinion
of the energy and judgement of Commius, and believed him
<span id="PI_CVI_Pg309a" class="sidenote">He commissions Commius to return with them and gain
over tribes.</span>
to be thoroughly loyal. Accordingly he charged him to
approach all the British chieftains with whom he had any
influence, engage them on the side of Rome, and give them
notice that he himself would shortly visit the island. Commius
took with him a troop of cavalry, composed of thirty
of his retainers.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg309b" class="sidenote">Volusenus’s
voyage of
reconnaissance.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Volusenus had been carrying out Caesar’s
instructions. His galley, manned by trained oarsmen, not
only made him comparatively independent of wind and tide,
but, owing to her superior speed, would enable him to keep
clear of any ships which Gauls or Britons might send against
him. We do not know what part of the coast he reconnoitred
first: but it is probable that his coasting voyage did not
extend beyond Lympne, or, at the furthest, Rye on one
side and the North Foreland on the other; for within those
limits the port and the alternative landing-place of which he
was in search were to be found. The port was indeed too
small for such a vast armada as would be required to transport
the grand army with which Caesar purposed eventually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
to invade Britain, but not for the comparatively small fleet
that had been collected for the preliminary expedition: if
Volusenus had sailed westward in quest of the great harbour
which he could not have found until he had reached the
coast of Sussex,<a id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">1297</a> he would have turned back when he saw
the inhospitable forest of the Weald, or the Fairlight Down;
and, moreover, he knew that Caesar intended to cross the
Channel in its narrowest part. While he was still some
miles from the British coast he could see the low but precipitous
chalk cliffs, backed by a commanding range of heights,
that hem in the rock-strewn shore of East Wear Bay: the
inlet of Folkestone was plainly too small to accommodate
the Roman fleet; and the first sight of the hills that guarded
the coast from Folkestone to Hythe and of the wooded uplands
that overlooked the tide-washed flat which is now
Romney Marsh,<a id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">1298</a> must have warned him not to advise the
great captain whom he served to land beneath them. It
was a maxim of ancient warfare, never disregarded without
urgent necessity, to avoid engaging an enemy who had the
advantage of higher ground; and there was not a foot of
land in the whole extent of coast between Shakespeare’s
Cliff and Lympne which a Roman soldier would not have
described as a most unfavourable position. The hills
behind Hythe were, indeed, pierced by three valleys: but
it was evident that they ascended to high, broken, and
wooded ground, where cavalry would be useless, and an
invading army would be encompassed by manifold perils;<a id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">1299</a>
and for such disadvantages the narrow pool harbour which
extended opposite Hythe, between the hills and the long
bank of shingle, through a gap in which it might be entered
at high tide,<a id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">1300</a> promised no compensation. Eastward of
Shakespeare’s Cliff Volusenus saw that he must look for the
place of disembarkation. There, sheltered in the valley
between the cliffs, was old Dover harbour, in which we may
suppose that Gallic merchants used to discharge their
freight.<a id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">1301</a> But even this haven would be useless if the landing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
were to be opposed; and it was necessary to look for some
broad expanse of open beach which would give easy access
to the interior. None such was yet visible. The galley ran
on under the Castle Cliff, round the Foreland and past the
coomb within which lies St. Margaret’s Bay, past the cliffs,
still precipitous but diminishing in height, which end at
Kingsdown. About a hundred yards further on the
ground was seen rising again; and the tribune observed
a low rampart of cliff extending and gradually sinking
towards the north till it finally terminated just south of the
spot where Walmer Castle rises amid embowering trees.
Stretching northward for several miles from this spot he saw
the open beach for which he had been looking. Not a sign
of high ground was visible. Once the legions had succeeded
in forcing their way on to dry land, they would find no
difficulty in following up their advantage; and the cavalry
would be able to ride down the beaten enemy. The slope
upon which Walmer Church now stands would afford a
suitable site for the camp. But it was of course impossible
to see far inland; and, as Volusenus could not venture to
disembark and run the risk of falling into the hands of the
natives, he was unable to find out all that he wished to know.
The nature of the inner country, the comparative density
of the population, the water-supply,&mdash;of all these things he
remained ignorant. But Caesar had chosen him because he
was the fittest man that he could find; and we may assume
that he did not neglect precautions which any competent
officer would have taken, and that he did not overlook what
no observant man could have failed to perceive. He spent
three entire days in British waters; and his time must have
been fully occupied. We may be sure that he bore in mind
that the beach was of shingle; that he took soundings all
along the coast between Walmer and Deal as close inshore
as he could venture to go, and tested the character of the
anchorage; and that he noted the phenomena which twice
daily obtruded themselves upon his attention,&mdash;the rise and
fall of the tide, and the movement up and down the Channel
of the tidal stream. Perhaps indeed he went as far north
as Sandwich, and concluded that a landing might still more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
advantageously be effected between that point and Sandown,
where, even in those days, the beach must have
shelved more gently than at Walmer or Deal.<a id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">1302</a> One other
feature, if it then existed, cannot have escaped his scrutiny,&mdash;the
Goodwin Sands, perhaps only half-formed, or the long
low bank of London Clay, which, as some geologists believe,
may then have occupied their place.<a id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">1303</a> On the fourth day
following that of his departure he returned to the Portus
Itius, and presented his report to Caesar.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg312a" class="sidenote">Kentishmen

<p>The Kentishmen, on their part, knew what they had to
expect. The Roman galley had of course been watched;
and though Caesar was coming professedly to receive them
under the protection of Rome, his visit would portend the
loss of their independence. If they chose to resist, they
would not be embarrassed by having a long line of coast to
defend. The movements of the galley indicated where the
fleet of which she was the forerunner would probably arrive;
and, moreover, those who lived by the sea were aware that
the invaders could not attempt to land except at a few
points within a strictly limited range. War-chariots would
be helpful in checking them when they attempted to advance
through the surf: accordingly the horses were exercised on
the beach until they became accustomed to enter the waves.</p>

<p>The Portus Itius was thronged with shipping, and the
preparations for the expedition were nearly complete; but
the base of operations was still insecure. The Morini had
hardly felt the weight of Caesar’s hand, and might give trouble
to the garrison which he intended to leave for the protection
of his communications: but the end of August was approaching;
he was anxious to set sail; and he had no time
to reduce the tribe to submission. Fortune, however, as
usual, befriended him. The various communities of the
Morini were accustomed to act independently. Envoys
from some of them appeared in Caesar’s camp, and excused
themselves for having resisted the Romans in the two
previous years. He of course accepted their excuses, and
ordered them to give him a large number of hostages, who
were promptly brought to the camp.

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg313" class="sidenote">55 <small>B.C.</small>
Caesar’s expeditionary force.</div>

<p>And now all was ready. The expeditionary force consisted
of two legions&mdash;the 10th, which had gained renown
on many fields and was regarded by Caesar with special
favour, and the 7th, which had played a conspicuous part
in the famous battle with the Nervii&mdash;besides about five
hundred cavalry, raised from various tribes of Gaul, slingers
from the Balearic Isles, and Numidian and Cretan archers.
The entire army numbered about ten thousand men. A small
squadron of galleys and about eighty transports were assembled
in the harbour; and on the 25th of August<a id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">1304</a> the legionaries
embarked on the transports, while the galleys were
assigned to the archers, slingers, and artillerymen. The
catapults which they carried would be worked, in case they
were required, under the protection of movable turrets, which
could be erected, at short notice, on their decks.<a id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">1305</a> Caesar
omitted to mention the class of ‘long ships’ to which they
belonged: but his narrative shows that they were shallow;
and it may be doubted whether any of them had more than
one bank of oars.<a id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">1306</a> The transports had of course been
carefully selected, and were all excellent sea-boats: but they
had not been designed for disembarking troops on an enemy’s
coast; and in case it should prove necessary to land on an
open beach, the troops whom they carried would find themselves,
on entering the water, almost out of their depth. They
were probably sailed by their native crews; and the galleys,
which were severally placed under the command of the
quaestor, the two generals who commanded the legions, and
the auxiliary officers, were doubtless handled by the seamen
and Provincial oarsmen who had manned them in the
preceding year. The fleet included some small fast-sailing
vessels of light draught, which were commonly used for
reconnoitring, and would now be called scouts. Eighteen
other transports were lying in the little harbour of Ambleteuse,
between five and six miles to the north,<a id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">1307</a> having been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
prevented by contrary winds from reaching the Liane; and,
as the wind was now favourable for the voyage to Britain,
and Caesar could not afford to wait, he sent his cavalry by
road with orders to embark on these vessels and follow him.
As the expedition was to be of such short duration, no heavy
baggage was taken, and only sufficient supplies to last for
a few days. A general named Sulpicius Rufus remained
with an adequate force to guard the camp and the harbour;
<span id="PI_CVI_Pg314a" class="sidenote">Sabinus and Cotta sent to punish the recalcitrant Morini and
the Menapii.</span>
while Titurius Sabinus, who had commanded a division in
the war of the previous year, and Aurunculeius Cotta, who
had served with distinction in the campaign against the
Belgae, were directed to march with the remaining legions
against those clans of the Morini which had not submitted,
and their neighbours, the Menapii.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg314b" class="sidenote">Caesar’s
voyage.</div>

<p>It was just five days before the full moon;<a id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">1308</a> and high
tide that evening was about six o’clock. About midnight the
moon set, and we may suppose that, like the ships of William
when he sailed to encounter Harold, each vessel carried a
lantern.<a id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">1309</a> Soon afterwards the signal was given to weigh
anchor,<a id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">1310</a> and the ships stood out to sea and steered against
the ebb tide, which, however, was moving at less than one
knot an hour,<a id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">1311</a> for Dover harbour.<a id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">1312</a> As they passed Ambleteuse,
there was no sign that the cavalry transports had
<span id="PI_CVI_Pg314c" class="sidenote">His cavalry transports fail to put to sea in time.</span>
yet got under way. About half an hour before sunrise the
stream turned eastward; and by that time Cape Grisnez
had been left behind. But at some period of the voyage
the wind must have shifted to an unfavourable quarter,<a id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">1313</a> for
<span class="sidenote">Aug. 26.</span>
it was not until the fourth hour of the day, or about nine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
o’clock in the morning,<a id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">1314</a> that the galleys approached the
Dover cliffs; and at that time the transports, which were
slower sailers and had no oars, were far behind. Above the
white precipices, ranged on the undulating downs behind,
Caesar descried an armed host of the enemy. ‘The formation
of the ground,’ he observed, ‘was peculiar, the sea being
so closely walled in by abrupt heights that it was possible
to throw a missile from the ground above on to the shore.’<a id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">1315</a>
To attempt a landing in the harbour or below the cliffs on
either side of it was of course out of the question; and
<span id="PI_CVI_Pg315" class="sidenote">He anchors off the Dover cliffs.</span>
Caesar determined to remain at anchor until the rest of the
fleet should arrive. The reader who is familiar with the
<cite>Commentaries</cite>, and can comprehend their implied meaning,
will perceive that the vessels must have been grouped in the
bay somewhere between the Castle Cliff and the South Foreland,
the one on the extreme right being about a mile westward
of the latter.<a id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">1316</a> Caesar summoned his generals and
tribunes to come on board, communicated to them the
substance of the report which he had received from Volusenus,
and instructed them how to handle their ships and
troops when the landing-place should be reached, warning
them above all to bear in mind that rapid and irregular
movements were of the essence of seamanship, and to be
prepared to obey orders on the instant. When he was
satisfied that all understood what was required of them, he
sent them back to their ships. Between three and four in
the afternoon the infantry transports arrived; and although
Caesar does not expressly say so, it seems reasonable to
assume that he communicated with their officers as well.<a id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">1317</a>
Between four and five the stream, which, for about six hours,
had been running down the Channel, turned towards the east,
and, as the wind was now blowing from a favourable quarter,
Caesar gave the signal to weigh anchor.<a id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">1318</a> A few minutes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
later galleys, transports, and smaller craft, with all sail set,
<span id="PI_CVI_Pg316a" class="sidenote">Late in the afternoon he sails on to Walmer&mdash;Deal.</span>
were running in an extended line past the Foreland, while
the British chariots and cavalry, followed by their infantry,
were hurrying across country to intercept them. In about
an hour the armada was off the coast between Walmer and
Deal, heading straight for the shore; and, while the galleys
were held ready for emergencies, the transports were run
aground.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg316b" class="sidenote">The landing
vigorously
resisted.</div>

<p>Caesar now saw crowding upon him the troubles that were
due to his lack of preparation. All along the beach a multitude
of painted warriors,<a id="FNanchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">1319</a> with long moustaches and hair
streaming over their shoulders, were drawn up ready for
action. The transports were immovable in water so deep
that the men, crowding in the bows, shrank from plunging
in; and when some of them overcame their hesitation, they
found themselves staggering and slipping, over-weighted by
their armour and encumbered by the shields on their left
arms and the javelins which they grasped in their right
hands; while the Britons, standing securely on the beach,
and the charioteers, driving their trained horses into the
sea, harassed them with missiles to which they could not
reply. Old soldiers as they were, they felt unnerved by
difficulties which they had never encountered before.
Caesar promptly sent the galleys to the rescue. Driven
through the water at their utmost speed, they were ranged
on the right flank of the enemy, who, alarmed by the long
low rakish hulls, the like of which they had never seen, and
distracted by the measured stroke of the oars, suddenly
found themselves assailed by slingers and archers, and
enfiladed by strange artillery. Unable to use their shields
unless they changed front, they ceased to press their attack,
stood still, and presently began to give ground. But few
of the legionaries had yet ventured to enter the water; and
the rest still hesitated to take advantage of the respite.
Then the standard-bearer of the 10th legion, calling upon
the gods for aid, turned to his comrades, and cried, ‘Leap
down, men, unless you wish to abandon the eagle to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
enemy. I, at all events, shall have done my duty to my
country and my general.’ Springing overboard, he advanced
alone, holding the eagle above his head. The men plucked
up courage, and, calling upon one another not to bring the
legion to shame, leaped all together from the bows. Encouraged
by their example, the men in the nearest vessels
followed, and the fight became general.</p>

<p>But the advantage was still with the defenders. The
galleys could not be everywhere at once. The Romans,
though they could not get firm foothold, tried hard to keep
their ranks and follow their respective standard-bearers;
but they soon lost all formation. As men entered the sea
from one ship or another, they attached themselves in
bewilderment to any standard they came across; and the
enemy on the shore, whenever they saw a few legionaries
dropping one by one into the water, drove their horses in, and
surrounded and attacked them before they could join their
comrades; while others planted themselves on the exposed
flank of a disordered unsupported group,<a id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">1320</a> and showered
missiles into their midst. Jarring with the shouts of the
disciplined soldiers, resounded the harsh Celtic yell,<a id="FNanchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">1321</a> the
clangour of the Celtic trumpet,<a id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">1322</a> and invocations uttered in
strange language to strange gods.<a id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">1323</a> Caesar now manned
his scouts and the boats belonging to the galleys, and sent
them in different directions to assist all who were overmatched.
Gradually the foremost bodies of legionaries
fought their way on to the beach: the rest followed quickly
<span id="PI_CVI_Pg317a" class="sidenote">Caesar’s victory indecisive owing to want of cavalry.</span>
in support; and now, closing their ranks and drawing their
swords, they charged the enemy with exultant cries, and
put them to flight. Want of cavalry, however, made it
impossible to complete the victory.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg317b" class="sidenote">The Romans
encamp.</div>

<p>It was now near sunset. The site which Volusenus had
noted for the camp was close to the sea; and while fatigue-parties
were sent out to cut wood and the outposts took up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
their appointed places, the rest of the troops fell to work
with pick and shovel along the lines which had been marked
out for them. The galleys were hauled up on the beach;
but the transports were necessarily left at anchor. Until
the cavalry should arrive it would not be prudent to venture
into the interior; and we may suppose that a galley was
sent back to the port of Ambleteuse, to inform their captains
about the landing-place for which they were to steer.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg318a" class="sidenote">British
chiefs sue
for peace.</div>

<p>It would seem that the resistance which the Britons had
opposed to the disembarkation was purely local, and that
no defensive league had been organized. The men of East
Kent were disheartened by failure, and on the next day sent
envoys to sue for peace. Some days before, when Commius
had just landed and was formally communicating Caesar’s
mandate to the chiefs, he had been arrested and imprisoned.
The envoys, who brought him with them, begged Caesar to
pardon this outrage, for which, they said, the ignorant
rabble were responsible. He replied that their countrymen
had made an unprovoked attack upon his army although
they had spontaneously sent an embassy to Gaul to proffer
submission; but he promised to accept their excuses on
condition of their giving hostages. Part of the required
number were handed over there and then, the envoys
promising that the rest, who would have to be fetched from
considerable distances, should be brought within a few days.
The Britons who had fought at Walmer were ordered by
their leaders to return home; and within the next few days
tribal chiefs arrived from various districts, and formally
surrendered.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg318b" class="sidenote">The
cavalry
transports
dispersed
by a gale.</div>

<p>On the morning of the 30th of August the long-looked-for
cavalry transports were descried in the offing. They had
sailed from Ambleteuse with a light breeze; but as they
were approaching the British coast a sudden gale prevented
them from keeping on their course. ‘Some,’ wrote Caesar,
‘were carried back to the point from which they had started,
while the others were swept down in great peril to the lower
and more westerly part of the island. They anchored notwithstanding;
but, as they were becoming waterlogged,
they were forced to stand out to sea in the face of night, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
make for the Continent.’<a id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">1324</a> The brief sentences tell a tale
which cannot be mistaken. The ships which were swept
down past the Foreland and the Dover cliffs scudded before
the north-easterly gale;<a id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">1325</a> and, although they were evidently
in no danger of being driven ashore, they were in great peril
because only the most watchful steering could prevent them
from broaching to: if a heavy sea struck the stern, it might
swing the vessel round, and in a moment she would be
overset and founder. The ships which were carried back to
the point from which they had started were of course handled
differently. A sailing-vessel, caught by a gale, must either
run before the wind or lie to. With these vessels the latter
course was adopted. Carrying only just enough sail to keep
them steady, they were laid to on the port tack; and once
they had drifted past Cape Grisnez into comparatively
sheltered water, they were able to stand in for the shore and
make the port of Ambleteuse.<a id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">1326</a> Not one of the eighteen
vessels, not a single man among their crews, was lost; and
this fact, which Caesar was careful to record, bears witness
to the skilful seamanship of the Gauls.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg319" class="sidenote">Caesar’s
fleet partially
wrecked.</div>

<p>But on the shores of East Kent the gale was still raging;
and the moon that shone out that night through the fleeting
clouds was at the full. Caesar’s officers and, it would seem,
Caesar himself were ignorant of the connexion between tide
and moon; but if he had ever had leisure to study the
writings of Pytheas or of Posidonius,<a id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">1327</a> he would have known
what he might expect. His Gallic pilots indeed could
certainly have enlightened him; and there will always remain
a doubt whether he did not know more than he chose
to admit. It was high water about an hour before midnight;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
and the seas that came rushing over the shingle before the
north-east wind rose as high as a spring tide. The galleys
which had been hauled up, as Caesar supposed, above high-water
mark, were swept by the waves; the transports were
driven ashore. Soldiers and crews could only look helplessly
on. Several vessels were totally wrecked; and the rest
lost their anchors, cables, and other tackle. No provision
had been made against the chance of such a disaster; and
the tools and materials that were needed for repairs were on
the other side of the Channel. The whole army was seized
with panic. Men asked one another how they were to
subsist when they had no grain, and how they were to get
back to Gaul when there were no ships to carry them.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg320a" class="sidenote">The British
chiefs
prepare to renew hostilities.</div>

<p>The British chiefs who were still in the camp saw their
opportunity. The coincidence of the shipwreck with the
full moon was a good omen.<a id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">1328</a> They knew that Caesar had
no supplies; and although they did not know exactly the
strength of his force, they saw that his camp was very small,
and concluded that his troops were correspondingly few.
Besides, his want of cavalry would place him at a disadvantage.
Accordingly, they determined to recall their
tribesmen, to prevent the Romans from getting supplies, and
to harass them by an irregular warfare, in the hope that they
would be able to starve them out, or at any rate prevent
them from re-embarking until wintry weather should have
set in. One by one they moved away from the camp without
attracting observation.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg320b" class="sidenote">Caesar
labours to

the
disaster.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Caesar was doing his best to retrieve the disaster;
and, although the chiefs managed to keep their plans secret,
he suspected that they meant mischief. Moreover, the
hostages who were still due did not arrive. The crops were
ripe; and troops were detailed every day to get corn. A
galley was sent back to Gaul to fetch everything that was
required for repairing the ships. Twelve of them were so
badly damaged that it was impossible to patch them up even
for one voyage; but their timbers and bronze were utilized
for the repair of the rest. All the legionaries who had any
knowledge of carpentry or metal-working were employed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
as shipwrights, and worked with such good will that
within a few days the fleet had been made tolerably seaworthy.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg321" class="sidenote">The 7th
legion surprised
and

<p>All this time natives were daily passing in and out of the
camp; and no one in the Roman army suspected that
trouble was brewing. At a considerable distance from
Walmer there was a wood, close to which was a field of
standing corn. Everywhere else the crops had been already
cut; and to this spot the 7th legion was dispatched. The
officer who commanded it neglected to send out scouts; and
the troops laid aside their arms, and went to work securely
with their reaping hooks. It is true that the only cavalry
were Commius’s thirty retainers; but they might have done
good service. It would seem that even the ordinary precaution
of keeping some of the cohorts under arms was
neglected.<a id="FNanchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">1329</a> Suddenly the enemy’s chariots and cavalry
emerged from the wood, and swept down upon the unarmed
and scattered reapers. The chariots careered at full gallop
all over the field, the warriors who stood beside the drivers
hurling javelins<a id="FNanchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">1330</a> or slinging stones at the legionaries as they
were running to seize their arms, and intimidating them, as
Caesar said, ‘by the mere terror inspired by their horses
and the clatter of the wheels:’ presently the drivers passed
into the intervals between the troops of their supporting

while the warriors leaped from their chariots and fought as
infantry, the drivers moved off to a safe distance, ready to
receive them in case they were hard pressed. Meanwhile
two cohorts were on guard as usual outside the gates of the
camp;<a id="FNanchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">1332</a> and some of their number reported to Caesar that an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
unusual amount of dust was rising in the direction in which
the 7th had gone. His suspicions were aroused; and,
ordering the two cohorts<a id="FNanchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">1333</a> to accompany him, two others to
take their places, and the remaining cohorts of the 10th
legion to leave their work, arm, and follow him immediately,
he marched towards the corn-field. He had advanced some
little distance before he came in sight of the legionaries,
who were evidently unable to hold their own. Huddled
together in a small space, with ranks disordered, they were
surrounded by cavalry and charioteers, missiles flying into
them from every side. Caesar was just in time. When the
enemy saw reinforcements approaching they suspended
their attack, and the 7th recovered from their panic. But
if the enemy had no mind to renew the combat, Caesar did
not feel able, without cavalry and with only two legions,
one of which had just been so roughly handled, to strike an
effective blow. ‘The moment,’ he afterwards explained,
‘was not favourable for challenging the enemy and forcing
on a battle.’<a id="FNanchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">1334</a> Accordingly he contented himself with
maintaining his ground, and, after a short interval, withdrew
both legions into camp.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg322" class="sidenote">Military
operations

owing to
bad
weather.</div>

<p>The tribesmen who had not yet rejoined their chiefs were
on the way: but during the next few days stormy weather
prevented the Romans from going out of camp and the
enemy from attacking them. Such was Caesar’s statement;
and it is not difficult to fathom his meaning. He would not
attack a mobile enemy whom it was difficult to bring to
action, but preferred to wait until they should attack him
on his own ground, before his impregnable camp: on the
other hand, the ground was so miry that for the time their
chariots could not act. The Kentish chiefs, however, were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
not idle. Messengers scoured the country, assured all who
still remained passive that the Roman army was contemptible,
and urged them to seize the opportunity of plundering their
camp and securing their own independence for ever. A large
body of horse and foot speedily assembled, and advanced
towards the coast. If they had been commanded by
one skilful leader, and had adhered to the simple plan of
harassing the Romans when they were endeavouring to
embark, they might have achieved something. But they
were a mere aggregate of tribal levies under tribal chiefs;
and greed and impatience worked their ruin. The one
thought that troubled Caesar was that their speed would
enable them to escape the consequences of defeat. They
<span id="PI_CVI_Pg323a" class="sidenote">The Britons, attempting to rush Caesar’s camp, are defeated
with heavy loss.</span>
made a wild attack upon the camp, and the legions, which
were drawn up outside, of course scattered them. Commius’s
horse were of some slight service in the pursuit; and
the legionaries, who exerted themselves to the utmost,
killed many of the fugitives, and burned all the buildings
which they had time to reach.</p>

<div id="PI_CVI_Pg323b" class="sidenote">Caesar

Gaul.</div>

<p>This success came just in time to enable Caesar to leave
Britain with some show of credit. His departure could not
be postponed. It was about the middle of September: the
dreaded equinox was near; and, with his unsound ships,
he would need a fine night for the voyage. He must therefore
have been relieved when, on the very day of their defeat,
the chiefs sent envoys to sue for peace. He ordered them
to find twice as many hostages as he had demanded before;
and, as he could not wait for them, the chiefs were to send
them in their own or the merchants’ vessels to Gaul.
Before he embarked he may have personally reconnoitred
the coast north of Walmer: anyhow he decided that, when
he returned in the following year, his best landing-place
would be the sandy flats between Sandown and Sandwich,
where, as we have seen, the seaward slope was gentler than
<span id="PI_CVI_Pg323c" class="sidenote">Causes of his partial failure.</span>
that of the Walmer shingle.<a id="FNanchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">1335</a> But otherwise the objects for
which he had undertaken the expedition had not been
attained. The time for preparation had been too short.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
Owing to the excessive draught of the transports, the disembarkation
had entailed unnecessary loss: by neglecting to
bring over supplies Caesar had exposed the 7th legion to
the risk of a defeat which would have been calamitous; while
the unfortunate absence of the cavalry had made it impossible
to obtain any information about the nature of the country,
and had weakened the effect of the final victory. The troops
were embarked without opposition, and, taking advantage
of a fair breeze, Caesar set sail just after midnight. The
<span id="PI_CVI_Pg324a" class="sidenote">Two transports fail to make the Portus Itius: the troops
whom they carried attacked by the Morini.</span>
fleet reached the opposite coast safely; but two of the transports,
which perhaps were in worse condition than the rest,
kept a little too far out to sea, and, failing to make the
mouth of the Liane, drifted a few miles further down the
coast and reached land somewhere north of the mouth of
Canche. The soldiers who had disembarked from them,
numbering about three hundred, were marching northward
to join their comrades when they were intercepted and
attacked by a band of the Morini, who belonged to one of
the clans which had submitted a few weeks before. As the
Romans were considerably outnumbered, they were obliged
to form in a square; and, hearing the shouts of the combatants,
large numbers flocked to join in the attack. The
three hundred defended themselves with vigour; and four
hours later, when Caesar’s cavalry came to the rescue, they
were still unbeaten. The assailants speedily dispersed;
<span id="PI_CVI_Pg324b" class="sidenote">Punishment of the Morini and Menapii.</span>
but next day Labienus marched against them with the two
legions which had just returned from Britain, and almost all
were taken prisoners. Titurius and Cotta, with the other
legions, had been punishing the Menapii. Finding that
they had taken refuge in their forests, they mercilessly
ravaged the open country, cutting the corn and burning the
hamlets. Thus, when the legions went into winter-quarters
in the country of the Belgae, Caesar might feel that in
the ensuing summer his base of operations would be
secure. ‘Thither,’ he wrote dryly, ‘two British tribes
and no more sent hostages: the rest neglected to
do so.’<a id="FNanchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">1336</a>

<div class="sidenote">55 <small>B.C.</small></div>

<p>When Caesar’s dispatches reached the Senate, they ordered
<span id="PI_CVI_Pg325" class="sidenote">Thanksgiving service at Rome for Caesar’s success.</span>
a thanksgiving service of twenty days to be held in honour
his exploits. No one who is versed in Roman literature
and gifted with historical imagination will regard the decree
as ironical. For Caesar’s countrymen may well have felt
that he had opened the way for the conquest of a new
world.

<div class="sidenote">55 <small>B.C.</small></div>

<p>Caesar had learned the lessons which failure had taught
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg326" class="sidenote">Caesar builds a fleet for a second expedition.</span>
him. In the winter he was obliged, as usual, to go to Cisalpine
Gaul, partly in order to discharge judicial and administrative
business, partly to safeguard his own political interests
in Italy. Before he left Belgium he ordered his generals to
employ the legions in repairing the old ships and building
a new fleet for the second expedition. He drew up minute
instructions for their guidance. Two thousand cavalry
horses, besides transport cattle, were to be conveyed across
the Channel; and, as the campaign would probably be
protracted, it would be impossible to leave all the heavy
baggage behind, and imprudent to trust again for supplies
to the resources of the country.<a id="FNanchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">1337</a> The ships were to be somewhat
shallower than those which were commonly used in
the Mediterranean, in order to facilitate the work of loading
and to enable them to be hauled up on the shore: on the
other hand, to make room for troops and freight, they were
to be rather broader in the beam. Their low freeboard
would admit of their being constructed for rowing as well
as sailing;<a id="FNanchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">1338</a> and Caesar, who had noticed that the waves in
the Channel were comparatively small, thought that it would
involve no danger. But this shallowness, combined with
unusual breadth, entailed a disadvantage which he had
perhaps not foreseen: it would cause the vessels, unless the
wind were right aft or on the quarter, to make a great deal
of leeway.<a id="FNanchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">1339</a> It was of course impossible to build such a large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
flotilla in one port. Some of the ships were to be constructed
in the mouth of the Seine: others doubtless in the Portus
Itius itself; others probably in the Canche, the Authie, and
the Somme, possibly even on the Marne, far from the sea-coast.<a id="FNanchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">1340</a>
The legionaries were ill provided with appliances
for ship-building: but they might be trusted to do their
best; and the tackle necessary for rigging and equipping
the fleet was to be imported from Spain. The cost of the
expedition would be very heavy: but Caesar was amassing
wealth for himself and his lieutenants by plundering Gaul;
and he certainly hoped to do more in Britain than recover
his expenses.<a id="FNanchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">1341</a></p>

<p>News of these preparations must of course have flown
swiftly across the Channel; but it is hardly surprising that
the British chieftains did not take advantage of the time
that was given them to mature a scheme of defence. Cassivellaunus
was still intent on self-aggrandisement; and in
the struggle with his neighbours, the Trinovantes, he slew
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg327a" class="sidenote">Mandubracius flees from Britain and takes refuge with Caesar.</span>
their king, whose son, Mandubracius, contrived to escape,
took ship for Gaul, and presented himself&mdash;the first of a
series of British exiles who invited Roman interference&mdash;in
Caesar’s camp. The exact date of his flight cannot be given:
it is sufficient to know that he was with Caesar when the
time arrived for the Roman army to embark.</p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg327b" class="sidenote">Caesar
winters in
Cisalpine
Gaul and
Illyricum.</div>

<p>Caesar did not start for Italy until the middle of November,<a id="FNanchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">1342</a>
and after he had fulfilled the civil duties which awaited him
in Cisalpine Gaul he was obliged to travel to the further
shore of the Adriatic in order to punish a tribe which had
been making devastating raids upon Illyricum. In the early
spring he was again in Cisalpine Gaul, clearing off arrears of
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg327c" class="sidenote">His correspondence with Cicero.</span>
work, and preparing to recross the Alps. Cicero for whom
he had an unfeigned admiration, and whom he was always
endeavouring to conciliate, was now upon the best of terms
with him; and his correspondence throws a ray of light upon
the hopes which had been awakened in Italy by the preparations
for a fresh expedition to Britain. Caesar was of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
course beset with letters of recommendation written by
public men on behalf of friends who hoped to acquire
riches in Gaul or Britain; and Cicero wrote one, as he alone
knew how to write, begging him to do something for a young
lawyer, named Trebatius, who was destined to achieve
distinction as a jurist. Caesar, however pressed with
business he might be, received all such applications, when
they came from men whom he cared to conciliate, with good
humour. ‘Just as I was speaking,’ wrote Cicero, ‘to our
friend Balbus at my house, a letter from you was handed
to me, at the end of which you say: “Rufus, whom you
recommend to me, I will make King of Gaul.... Send me
some one else to provide for!” ... I therefore send you
Trebatius.’<a id="FNanchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">1343</a> The confiding lawyer wanted to make a fortune
without having to work for it: but Cicero banteringly told
him to moderate his expectations. ‘I hear,’ he wrote,
‘there is no gold or silver in Britain. If so, I advise you to
capture a war-chariot and come back in it as soon as you can.’<a id="FNanchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">1344</a>
He ended his letter by telling Trebatius that if he wished to
cultivate Caesar’s friendship, he must take the trouble to
make himself useful. Caesar bestowed upon him the rank
of tribune, exempting him from military duty, for which he
was manifestly unfit; but, after a short experience of camp
life, he made up his mind that the expedition would involve
more hardship than profit, and preferred to remain in Gaul.
But Caesar had gained another adherent who turned out a
real soldier. Quintus Cicero, the orator’s younger brother,
had consented to serve on his staff as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legatus</i>, or general
of division;<a id="FNanchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">1345</a> and a few words from a letter in which this
consent is alluded to illustrate the gracious tact which helped
Caesar to gain adherents. ‘Caesar,’ writes Marcus Cicero
to his brother, ‘has written to Balbus that the little bundle
of letters in which mine and Balbus’s were packed was so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
saturated with rain when it was delivered to him that he was
not even aware that there was one from me. However, he
had made out a few words of Balbus’s, to which he replied
as follows:&mdash;“I see you have written something about
[Quintus] Cicero, which I have not deciphered: but as far as
I could guess, it was of a kind that I might wish, but hardly
hope to be true.”’<a id="FNanchor_1346" href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">1346</a> On the 30th of April Quintus was with
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg329a" class="sidenote">Cicero’s hopes and fears about the second British expedition.</span>
Caesar at Blandeno, a small town near Placentia. Marcus
knew of course that Quintus was to accompany the expedition
to Britain; and he indulged the fancy that Caesar’s
exploits would furnish him with a theme for a heroic poem.
‘Only give me Britain,’ he wrote to Quintus, ‘to paint in
colours supplied by you, but with my own brush.’<a id="FNanchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">1347</a> But
he must have soon received discouraging news; for early in
June<a id="FNanchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">1348</a> he wrote to Atticus:&mdash;‘The result of the British
expedition is a source of anxiety. For it is notorious that
the approaches to the island are ramparted by astonishing
masses of cliff; and, besides, it is now known that there
isn’t a pennyweight of silver in the island, nor any hope of
loot except from slaves; and I don’t suppose you expect
any of them to be a scholar or a musician.’<a id="FNanchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">1349</a></p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg329b" class="sidenote">Caesar
returns
to Gaul.</div>

<p>By this time Caesar and his new lieutenant, having posted
across Gaul at the rate of fifty miles a day or more,<a id="FNanchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">1350</a> must
have reached the country of the Belgae; and there is no
more conclusive proof of the hold which he had already
obtained upon the Gallic tribes than the fact that he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
able to count, as securely as in Italy, upon finding horses
ready for each successive stage. He immediately proceeded
to inspect the various shipyards, near which the troops were
encamped, and was well satisfied with the manner in which
his instructions had been executed. ‘Thanks,’ he wrote,
‘to the extraordinary energy of the troops, and in spite of
the extreme deficiency of resources, about six hundred
vessels of the class specified and twenty-eight ships of war
had been built, and would probably be ready for launching
in a few days.’<a id="FNanchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">1351</a> Caesar, who knew the stimulating power
of discriminative praise, bestowed hearty commendation
upon officers and men, and gave orders that the ships, as
soon as they were ready for sea, should all assemble in the
Portus Itius. For this purpose he detached an adequate
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg330" class="sidenote">He is obliged to march to the country of the Treveri.</span>
number of troops. Meanwhile his presence was urgently
required in the country of the Treveri, a powerful tribe who
inhabited parts of Luxembourg and Rhenish Prussia, and
whose name survives in that of the modern Trèves. A
squadron of cavalry furnished by this people had served on
his side in the battle with the Nervii, and had deserted in
a body at a moment when it seemed that he was doomed to
defeat. Since that day the Treveri had refused to send representatives
to attend the councils of Gallic magnates which
he periodically convened; and he was now informed that
they were making overtures to the Germans. Unless he
recalled them to obedience, it was more than probable that
while he was absent in Britain, Gauls and Germans would
raise a rebellion in his rear. Accordingly, he marched
against the malcontents with four lightly equipped legions
and eight hundred cavalry. Fortunately for him the
Treveri were not unanimous. Two rival leaders, Indutiomarus
and Cingetorix, were struggling for supremacy.
Cingetorix at once threw in his lot with Caesar, and gave him
full information of all that was going on. Indutiomarus
began to raise levies, and prepared to resist; but, finding
that most of his fellow chieftains were going over to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
stronger side, he sent envoys to Caesar, and endeavoured to
explain away his conduct. Unwilling to lose time, Caesar
feigned to accept his excuses, and contented himself with
taking hostages for his good behaviour.</p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg331a" class="sidenote">Returning
to the
Portus
Itius, he
finds fleet
and army
assembled.</div>

<p>It was near the middle of June when he returned to the
camp on the Liane. More than eight hundred vessels of all
sorts were in the harbour, including numerous small craft,
constructed by rich officers who desired to make the voyage
in comfort, by merchants who had dealings with the troops,
or by adventurers who, we may suppose, had been attracted
by stories of the wealth of Britain;<a id="FNanchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">1352</a> but sixty of Caesar’s
ships had encountered contrary winds, and failed to arrive.<a id="FNanchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">1353</a>
The entire Roman army, comprising eight legions, perhaps
about thirty-five thousand men, besides slingers, archers,
and four thousand Gallic cavalry, were assembled on the
spot. The notables from all the tribes had also repaired
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg331b" class="sidenote">He resolves to take Gallic chiefs of
doubtful fidelity as hostages to Britain.</span>
thither in obedience to Caesar’s summons. He was aware
that there was much smouldering discontent among them,
and he intended to take all but the few on whose fidelity
he could depend, as hostages across the Channel. Among
these was one whose name, as written by Caesar, was
Dumnorix, and whose coins, bearing the legend <small>DUBNOREIX</small>,<a id="FNanchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">1354</a>
still testify to the authority which he exercised. He was the
most powerful chieftain of the Aedui, the most powerful Gallic
tribe, whose territories, corresponding with the Nivernais
and Western Burgundy, gave access to all parts of Northern
and Western Gaul; who, from the time when the legions
first entered Transalpine Gaul, had borne the honorary title
of ‘Friends and Allies of the Roman People’; and whom it
had been Caesar’s constant policy to treat with special
favour. Dumnorix was the leader of the anti-Roman
faction which existed in this as in almost every other Gallic
tribe. He was a man of boundless ambition, the vehemence
of whose character was out of all proportion with his judgement:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
he had amassed great wealth, which enabled him to
maintain an army of retainers; and he had great influence
not only with the lower orders in his own country but also
with the Gauls of every tribe who wished to rid themselves
of the Roman dominion. For the last four years his intrigues
had caused anxiety to Caesar. He had been secretly
in league with the Helvetian invaders at the time when
Caesar marched to encounter them; and in the early part
of the campaign his own brother, the famous Druid, Diviciacus,
as well as the chief magistrate of his own tribe, had
advised Caesar to beware of him. At that time Caesar had
not felt sufficiently secure in his new position to punish him;
he had simply given him a severe reprimand and a stern
warning, but had ever since employed spies to watch his
movements. It was now reported that Dumnorix had
announced in the Aeduan tribal council that Caesar intended
to make him king, and that the announcement had been
received with alarm and indignation. There are writers
who believe that Caesar had really offered him the throne in
order to purchase his support: but it is hardly credible that
he would have made such a gross miscalculation; and
there is more reason in concluding that Dumnorix had
spread a false report in order to estrange the loyal Aeduans
from Caesar’s side. At all events he was irreconcilable;
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg332a" class="sidenote">Dumnorix resolves not to go.</span>
and he determined that to Britain he would not go. He
began by imploring Caesar to allow him to remain behind,
pleading that he was not accustomed to the sea, and dreaded
it, and insisting that he was debarred by religious obligations
from leaving the Continent. Finding Caesar obdurate, he
approached his brother chieftains, and adjured them to
join him in refusing to go, assuring them that Caesar only
wanted to get them out of Gaul in order that he might safely
put them to death. Caesar did his utmost to keep him quiet,
at the same time informing himself through his agents of all
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg332b" class="sidenote">The fleet weatherbound.</span>
that he said and did. Meanwhile the fleet was lying idle in
the harbour. All the preparations were complete: but
continuous north-westerly winds made it impossible to sail;
and we may safely presume that the troops, who might be
required to row the transports, were employed in learning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
to use their oars. The two Ciceros were in constant correspondence;
and the elder brother was impatiently waiting
for the announcement that the campaign had begun. On the
2nd of July he wrote to Atticus, ‘Judging from my brother
Quintus’s letter, I imagine that by this time he is in Britain.
I am anxiously waiting for news of his movements.’<a id="FNanchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">1355</a> The
fleet had been weatherbound then for about three weeks;
and the chief of Caesar’s commissariat, who succeeded in
feeding forty thousand men for so long a period in an unfriendly
country, must have possessed rare powers of
organization. At length the wind shifted; and infantry
and cavalry began to embark. Suddenly, while every man
in the force had his thoughts concentrated on the work in
hand, Caesar received news that Dumnorix and his Aeduan
troopers had gone. Instantly he stopped the embarkation;
and a strong detachment of cavalry was soon riding in
pursuit with orders to bring Dumnorix back, or, if he resisted,
to kill him on the spot: for, as Caesar afterwards said, ‘he
thought that a man who disregarded his authority when he
was present would not behave rationally in his absence.’<a id="FNanchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">1356</a>
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg333a" class="sidenote">The fate of Dumnorix.</span>
Adjuring his retainers to be true to him, Dumnorix resisted
desperately; but he was surrounded and slain, passionately
crying with his last breath that he was a free man and a
citizen of a free country.</p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg333b" class="sidenote">Caesar

<p>It was about the 6th of July, probably the day after this
episode, when the embarkation took place.<a id="FNanchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">1357</a> Commius, still
friendly to Rome, was to accompany the expedition, as well
as Mandubracius, the Trinovantian prince who had placed
himself under Caesar’s protection. The slaughter of
Dumnorix, following the temporary submission of Indutiomarus,
had relieved Caesar from imminent danger: but he
knew that to keep a hold on the half-subdued and restless
peoples whom he was leaving behind would require all the
ability of his ablest lieutenant; and there are indications in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
his narrative that he hoped, if all went well, to winter in
Britain, and thus to find time not merely to deter the
Britons from combining with the Gauls, but to conquer the
south-eastern part of the country.<a id="FNanchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">1358</a> Labienus therefore
remained in charge of the camp and port with three legions
and two thousand cavalry. He was to keep the expeditionary
force supplied with corn, ascertain all that was passing
in Gaul, and act on his own discretion according to circumstances.
Among the divisional commanders that accompanied
Caesar was Gaius Trebonius, an intimate friend of
Marcus Cicero,<a id="FNanchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">1359</a> who, two years before, had proposed, in the
interests of the triumvirate, the law by which the province of
Syria was assigned to Crassus, and the two provinces of
Spain to Pompey. Late in the afternoon all was ready for
the start, the flotilla lying moored in the harbour with five
legions and two thousand cavalry on board. The ebb
stream was running slowly down the coast. Towards sunset
the hawsers were cast off,<a id="FNanchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">1360</a> and the ships steered north by
west before a light south-westerly wind. The moon was
invisible,<a id="FNanchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">1361</a> but at that time of the year there is no real night
in these latitudes; and perhaps, as in the preceding year,
each vessel hoisted a lantern when the twilight waned.
About ten o’clock the stream began to run up the Channel,
and for a time the vessels made good progress. By midnight
the leading division was not far off the South Foreland, and
somewhere near what is now the southern end of the Goodwin
Sands; but it is probable that in steering, sufficient allowance
had not been made for the current, and that the shallow
flat-bottomed vessels had already drifted to leeward away
from their true course. And now the wind, which had been
gradually dying down, almost entirely dropped, only retaining
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg334" class="sidenote">The fleet drifts north-eastward out of its course.</span>
just sufficient force to give steerage way. Borne along
by a rapid flood, the armada drifted into the North Sea; and
about a quarter past three, when day broke, Caesar descried
the white cliffs of Kingsdown and the South Foreland
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
receding on the port quarter. Right opposite, but hardly
discernible, was the low coast on which he had landed in the
previous year. We may assume that when he saw where he
was drifting he anchored for a time. Presently the stream
ceased to run up the Channel, and, after a few minutes’
slack water, the ebb set in.<a id="FNanchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">1362</a> The Romans had a system of
naval signalling,<a id="FNanchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">1363</a> and either by this means or by oral instructions
conveyed from vessel to vessel, the order was given to
go about and run down Channel with the stream. The
soldiers on board the transports got out their oars. For
some time their work was easy; but when, not far from the
spot where the South Sand Head Light Vessel is now moored,
the ships’ heads were turned in the direction of Sandwich, they
encountered a cross current setting towards the south-west.<a id="FNanchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">1364</a>
Although the transports were heavily laden, they toiled with
an energy which earned Caesar’s warm admiration, and actually
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg335a" class="sidenote">The landing-place, between Sandown Castle and Sandwich, reached by rowing.</span>
succeeded in keeping up with the galleys. About noon
the whole fleet had reached the landing-place; but no enemy
was to be seen, and in the course of the day a galley was
speeding back across the Channel with one of Caesar’s
couriers on board, who carried, besides other dispatches,
a letter in which Quintus Cicero informed his brother that
all was well.<a id="FNanchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">1365</a></p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg335b" class="sidenote">Leaving
the fleet at
anchor in
charge of

Caesar
marches
against
the
Britons,</div>

<p>While the troops and baggage were being disembarked,
Caesar chose a site for his camp, perhaps on the slight eminence
near the village of Worth. Some prisoners were soon
brought in by the cavalry and questioned. They stated
that their countrymen had assembled in large numbers to
oppose the landing, but that, on observing the huge size of the
the armada, they had abandoned the shore and retreated
to higher ground inland. Caesar determined to march
against them that very night, and accordingly accepted the
risk of not hauling his ships up on shore, an operation which
would have consumed valuable time. He had not forgotten
the disaster of the previous year; but, as the shore where he
now left the ships at anchor was not only perfectly open but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
sloped very gently seaward, he felt little anxiety for their
safety.<a id="FNanchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">1366</a> He mentioned this fact in his memoirs<a id="FNanchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">1367</a> with an
emphasis which suggests that he wished to deprecate professional
criticism. Moreover, the storm which had wrought
such havoc before had occurred on the night of a full moon:
the moon was now new; and it may be doubted whether
Caesar had studied the writings of the Greek astronomers,
or consulted the pilots, from whom he would have learned
that the tides at new and at full moon are virtually identical.
Ten cohorts selected from the various legions, or about four
thousand men, and three hundred cavalry were left, under
the command of an officer named Quintus Atrius, to protect
the fleet. Soon after midnight Caesar set out against the
enemy. We may presume that he had sent a troop of
cavalry in the afternoon to reconnoitre; but he must have
trusted to his prisoners for information as to the whereabouts
of the British force. It was posted on high ground overlooking
Durovernum, the village which stood upon the site
of Canterbury, and which the Romans afterwards linked by a
system of roads with their settlements at London, Reculver,
Richborough, Dover, and Stutfall near West Hythe. The
general direction of Caesar’s march is indicated by the road
which runs across the gently undulating and somewhat
featureless country between Sandwich and Canterbury.
He had advanced about eleven miles when, in the early
morning, he descried the enemy’s cavalry and charioteers
descending from high ground towards the left bank of the
Stour. The spot where he encountered them must have
been somewhere between Sturry on the east of Canterbury,
and Thanington on the west; and military experts who know
the country will probably conclude that it was near the latter.<a id="FNanchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">1368</a>
The enemy had doubtless attempted to occupy the whole
range of low hills which closes the valley of the Stour between
these two points, prepared to oppose the legions wherever
they might attempt to cross. It would seem, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
that their resistance was comparatively feeble, perhaps
because they were surprised, and, having needlessly strung
out their forces, were unable to concentrate in time. Caesar
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg337a" class="sidenote">forces the passage of the Stour near Canterbury,</span>
may have sent a detachment to turn their position: anyhow
they were driven from the banks after a combat which he
recorded in a single sentence. Retreating to the higher
ground, they took up their position in a stronghold situated
in the midst of woods,&mdash;probably the earthwork, about a
mile and a half west of Canterbury, through which runs the
Pilgrims’ Way, and within which, as we have seen, have
been discovered iron implements and weapons of pre-Roman
age.<a id="FNanchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">1369</a> The legions, pressing after them, found the entrances
blocked by <i>abatis</i>; and when they attempted to force their
way in, the Britons, issuing from the woods in small groups,
assailed them with showers of missiles. It would appear
from Caesar’s narrative that the rampart, or at least a part
of it, extended along the edge of the wood. The 7th legion
was selected for the assault. Advancing in a dense column,
with shields close-locked over their heads, they shot earth
or fascines into the ditch so as to form a causeway flush with
the top of the rampart; and it may be conjectured that the
work was performed by men who advanced between the
files under the protection of their comrades’ uplifted shields.<a id="FNanchor_1370" href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">1370</a>
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg337b" class="sidenote">and storms a fort, to which they had retreated.</span>
In this way the entrenchment, which, like all the British
forts that Caesar saw, was weaker than the great strongholds
of Western Britain, was speedily captured with small loss;
and the Britons were expelled from the woods. The
legionaries followed up their success, but Caesar soon stopped
the pursuit. He was afraid to run the risk of letting his
troops get entangled in a wooded country, of the intricacies
of which he was ignorant; and, as it was late in the afternoon,
he was obliged to utilize the remaining hours of daylight for
the construction of his camp.</p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg337c" class="sidenote">Next
morning
he sends
three
columns in
pursuit,</div>

<p>Early next morning he dispatched his cavalry in three
columns, each supported by a strong body of infantry, to
hunt down the fugitives. The pursuers had advanced a
considerable distance from the camp, the rearguard being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
still in sight,<a id="FNanchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">1371</a> when some troopers rode up to Caesar with
a note from Atrius. A storm had arisen on the previous
night: the ships had parted from their anchors, collided with
one another, and almost all been dashed ashore and damaged.
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg338a" class="sidenote">but is forced to recall them by news that many of his ships had been wrecked.</span>
Caesar sent gallopers to recall the pursuing columns, and
order them to march back to the coast, defending themselves,
if necessary, against a counter-attack, and started in person
for the scene of the wreck.<a id="FNanchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">1372</a> When he arrived, he found that
Atrius’s report was accurate: about forty ships were
totally destroyed; but, after inspecting the rest, he saw
that it would be possible to repair them. In the course of
the day the legions arrived. The men who had enlisted as
skilled craftsmen were segregated and set to work; and
galleys were sent to Labienus with a letter in which he was
ordered to dispatch gangs of shipwrights from his three
legions, and to employ the rest of the men in building new
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg338b" class="sidenote">He beaches the ships, constructs a naval camp, and repairs damage.</span>
vessels. Caesar reluctantly concluded that the only way of
preventing another disaster was to have all the ships hauled
up on land out of reach of the highest spring tides. They
were doubtless moved in the usual way, by capstans over
greased logs, which the Romans called <i>phalangae</i>;<a id="FNanchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">1373</a> and then,
in order to secure them against attack, an earthwork was
thrown up round them, and connected with the existing
camp. The amount of labour which these operations entailed
was enormous: but there were some twenty thousand willing
workers; and by employing them in relays all day and all
night, Caesar was able to complete the task in about ten
days. The repairs of course required a longer time.</p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg338c" class="sidenote">Results
of the
disaster.</div>

<p>This second shipwreck was a calamity of which the mere
loss in ships formed the smallest part. It changed the
course of the campaign. Why had not Caesar restrained
his eagerness to close with the enemy, and employed every
available man in beaching the vessels which he had constructed
with that very aim? Granted that it might not
have been possible to complete even the mere work of
dragging them all out of reach of the waves before the
storm began, he would still have done right in not presuming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
upon the favour of fortune. Nobody knew better how
necessary it is, especially in making war upon a half-civilized
enemy, to complete all preparations, even at the cost of delay,
before opening the campaign, so as to lose not a moment in
following up an initial success, and to give fugitives no time
to recover from their demoralization. Less than two days
after he set foot in Britain he had dealt the enemy a succession
of heavy blows, and the game was in his hands,&mdash;when all
that he had done was undone by his own carelessness.
Britons saw Romans in full retreat, and concluded that they
were not invincible.</p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg339" class="sidenote">Caesar

towards
Canterbury.
Cassivellaunus
elected
commander-in-chief of
the
Britons.</div>

<p>By the time when the naval camp was finished the season
was far advanced. It was near the end of the third week in
July when Caesar was able to renew his campaign. The
Britons had made good use of their respite. The tribes had
suspended their feuds: Cassivellaunus had been called upon
by a general assembly of notables<a id="FNanchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">1374</a> to undertake the chief
command with full powers; and a large force, composed of
contingents from all, or almost all, the cantons of the south-eastern
district, had marched to join the men of East Kent.
We may doubt whether the Trinovantes had not held aloof;
but if they had been forced to join the league, they were
half-hearted. It is certain that, before Caesar had been
long in the island, they sent envoys, promising submission
and begging him to send Mandubracius back to them as
their ruler and to protect him against Cassivellaunus. He
allowed Mandubracius to depart, only stipulating that the
Trinovantes should give him forty hostages and provide
grain for his army; and readers who can interpret the
<cite>Commentaries</cite> will conclude that the embassy was dispatched
before he had advanced far into the interior, and doubtless
as soon as he had proved his superiority. He left the same
force as before&mdash;ten cohorts and three hundred cavalry&mdash;to
protect the camp, and marched once more in the direction
of Canterbury. As he was approaching the valley of the
Stour, the enemy’s cavalry and charioteers commenced
a fierce running fight with his Gallic cavalry; but they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
beaten back at all points and driven to take refuge on the
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg340" class="sidenote">The Romans harassed by British charioteers.</span>
wooded heights near the river. The Gallic cavalry, however,
over-eager to pursue, and getting entangled in ground which
was unknown to them, suffered considerable loss; and soon
afterwards, while the legionaries, careless of danger, were
engaged in entrenching their camp, the enemy suddenly
swooped down upon the cohort on guard and began to
overpower it. Caesar had not yet learned due respect for
his enemy; otherwise he would have kept a much more
powerful force, as he had done on a similar occasion in Gaul,
to protect the working-parties. He sent two cohorts, however,
to support the struggling guard and cut off the retreat
of the assailants. These reinforcements were separated
from one another by a narrow interval: the men who composed
them, and who had not served in the preceding year,
were unnerved by the novel tactics of the charioteers; and
the enemy boldly rushed through the interval, and got back
to the main body unhurt. Several additional cohorts,
accompanied by cavalry, were sent to retrieve the situation.
The combat was clearly visible from the camp; and Caesar
saw that his troops, who had so often routed their continental
enemies, were at a serious disadvantage. The Britons fought
not in close order but in small groups, separated by wide
intervals; and when these were tired, their places were taken
by reserves. Whenever a group was hard pressed by the
legionaries, the men who composed it ran away: the Romans,
weighted by their heavy armour, were ineffective in pursuit;
and, besides, accustomed as they were to fight in compact
masses, they and their officers naturally failed to adapt themselves
to new conditions. Again, when the Gallic cavalry
charged the charioteers, the latter drove rapidly away; and,
as soon as they had withdrawn their assailants from the
support of the legions, the warriors leaped to the ground, and,
supported by their own cavalry, fought as infantry, with the
odds in their favour.<a id="FNanchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">1375</a> A tribune named Quintus Laberius
Durus was killed; but at length the reinforcements which
Caesar sent up succeeded in beating back the Britons, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
at all events deterring them for the moment from renewing
their attack.</p>

<p>All this time Caesar was doubtless fighting to gain the
line of the road or trackway by which he would have to
march westward into the interior of Britain and assail the
dominions of Cassivellaunus. But it was of course out of
the question to begin his march until he had inflicted a
crushing defeat upon the allies; and, as he saw now, their
game was to avoid a general action. On the following day,
however, a chance presented itself. In the morning the
enemy, who had taken up a position on the heights at some
distance from the Roman camp, moved down, as before, in
scattered groups, and began to assail the cavalry outposts,
but with somewhat diminished vigour. The outposts fell
back; and presently the whole of the cavalry were sent out,
along with three of the legions, under Gaius Trebonius, on
a foraging expedition. Part of the force proceeded to cut
grass, while the rest remained drawn up in support. Suddenly
the enemy rushed down from all points on the foragers,
and, made reckless by success, ‘did not even hesitate,’ as
Caesar wrote, ‘to attack the ordered ranks of the legions.’<a id="FNanchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">1376</a>
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg341a" class="sidenote">Trebonius routs the Britons.</span>
The Romans charged them fiercely, and took ample revenge
for the previous day. The Britons were driven from the
field, hotly pursued by Trebonius and his men, until the
Gallic cavalry, relying upon the support of the legions, which
still followed as closely as they could, hunted them in
headlong rout, cutting them down in numbers, and never
giving them a chance of rallying. Not even the charioteers
could get a moment’s respite, or dared to dismount and turn
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg341b" class="sidenote">The British infantry disperse.</span>
upon their pursuers. This defeat was decisive. The tribal
levies of foot at once dispersed to their homes; and ‘from
that time’, wrote Caesar, ‘the enemy never encountered
us in a general action.’<a id="FNanchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">1377</a></p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg341c" class="sidenote">War-chariots
<i>versus</i>
Roman
troops.</div>

<p>Cassivellaunus had learned a lesson which his kinsmen on
the other side of the Channel were already taking to heart.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
His undisciplined foot were evidently powerless to contend
against the legions on a fair field, and, except behind works,
in a strong position, or in attacking small bodies which had
been carelessly isolated, they were of little use. The Celtic
infantry of the more warlike tribes were not indeed to be
despised. The Helvetii with their allies made a stubborn
fight against Caesar: the Parisian confederation under the
veteran Camulogenus tested the mettle of Labienus; and
the issue of the battle with the Nervii remained long doubtful.
But in all these combats the Celts had a great numerical
advantage; and in all they were beaten to the verge of
annihilation. Cassivellaunus saw that his object was not
to be attained by regular warfare. Moreover, it is certain
that, during a prolonged campaign, he would have been unable
to feed a large army. But he still had four thousand
charioteers with the cavalry who supported them;<a id="FNanchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">1378</a> and on
them he determined to rely. The success with which he
had already used them makes us wonder why the Continental
Celts had abandoned the arm which their insular
kinsmen wielded with such effect. Less than a century
before Caesar crossed the Alps chariots had been generally
employed in Eastern and in Central Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">1379</a> Chariots have
been found in scores in the great sepulchres of the Iron Age
which have been opened in Burgundy and Champagne,
while in the British barrows their remains are extremely
rare.<a id="FNanchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">1380</a> It is evident to every reader of the <cite>Commentaries</cite>
that Caesar was at his wits’ end to know how to adapt his
organization to this strange form of resistance; and it is
equally evident that on his own side of the Channel he never
encountered it at all. The most satisfactory explanation is
to be found in a passage of the <cite>Commentaries</cite> from which
we learn that the Gauls spent large sums in buying well-bred
horses.<a id="FNanchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">1381</a> Evidently they discarded chariots for cavalry
when they began to import from Southern Europe horses
which were powerful enough to carry big men and charge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
with effect.<a id="FNanchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">1382</a> The German cavalry, it is true, had only small
underbred cattle; but they were virtually mounted infantry.<a id="FNanchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">1383</a>
The British may have been well or ill mounted; but for the
most part British horses were no bigger than ponies,<a id="FNanchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">1384</a> able
to draw a light car but not to gallop fast with heavy riders.
Still, whoever calls to mind how in the last Samnite War the
Gallic chariots routed the Roman cavalry,<a id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">1385</a> will perhaps
doubt whether the Gauls did well to abandon chariots altogether
in favour of mounted troops.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the reader who trusts to his first impressions
of Caesar’s narrative is prone to exaggerate the successes of
the British charioteers. Their object was to break up the
formation of their opponents; and this they could only do
when carelessness gave them an opening. The punishment
which they inflicted upon the 7th legion was invited by the
almost incredible negligence of its commander: the check
which Caesar himself suffered in the following year befell
an outpost of inadequate strength. In irregular warfare
chariots could cause serious trouble; but the difficulty
which Caesar found in dealing with them was partly due to
the fact that his army, like all Roman armies, was weak in
cavalry,&mdash;and in cavalry of the right kind. If he could have
taken to Britain one of those German squadrons with their
attendant light infantry which so effectively supported him
in the war with Vercingetorix, he would have had less
trouble in his encounters with the British charioteers.</p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg343" class="sidenote">Caesar
marches
for the
country of
Cassivellaunus,</div>

<p>Caesar now marched for the country of Cassivellaunus,
who, as he divined, intended thenceforth to wage a guerrilla
warfare. The troops must have carried in their wallets
rations for several days, drawn from the magazine in the
naval camp; for they could not count upon getting supplies
from the farms till they reached the territory of the Trinovantes;
and we may be sure that Caesar, venturing into an
unexplored country and against so troublesome an enemy,
dispensed as far as possible with transport. What route he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
followed is an interesting but perhaps insoluble question.
He dismisses the story of the march, which must have
occupied nearly a week, in a single sentence, which contains
no clue. We know only that he started from the neighbourhood
of Canterbury, and that he crossed the Thames at
or not far from Brentford.<a id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">1386</a> It is, however, morally certain
that he marched either by the trackway on the line of
which the Romans of a later period made the great road
called Watling Street, which crosses the Medway between
Rochester and Strood, or along the southern slope of the
chalk escarpment, and across the Medway at Aylesford or
Halling. All the antiquities of Roman or pre-Roman age
that have been discovered in Kent, west of the maritime
tract which is bounded by a line drawn from Reculver
through Canterbury and Lympne to Romney, have come
from sites clustering alongside these routes.<a id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">1387</a> That
Caesar makes no mention of the Medway has no significance.
He must have crossed it somewhere; and it is
certain that he crossed many rivers to which he never
alluded unless the passage had some tactical or strategical
importance. His narrative shows that his object was to
inflict the greatest damage possible upon the enemy’s homesteads
and farms; and we may reasonably suppose that he
followed the route, leading through a fertile and populous
country, which his successors selected, diverged from it
somewhere near Rochester, and thence advanced by way of
Bromley. But the matter is of no great consequence.
Caesar demands from his readers not only attention and
intelligence, but also expert knowledge; but from those
who possess these qualifications he rarely withholds necessary
information: when he baffles their curiosity, his silence
does not prevent them from understanding what is essential.</p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg344" class="sidenote">whose
chariots

<p>During a great part of the march Cassivellaunus dogged
the Roman column. Caesars object was to strike terror;
and despoil the inhabitants of their chief source of wealth,&mdash;their
flocks and herds. But Cassivellaunus soon taught him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
a lesson of caution. He succeeded in ascertaining what
route the Romans intended to pursue, and sent messengers
to warn the inhabitants to drive their cattle into the woods
and to fly for refuge thither themselves. Knowing every
inch of the country, and having the advantage of superior
mobility, he would conceal his force in some wooded spot,
and when he saw the Roman horsemen diverge from the
column and ride forth to plunder, swoop down upon them
and inflict heavy loss. Caesar was compelled to keep his
cavalry, who were terrorized by these unforeseen attacks, in
constant touch with the infantry; while the legions, whose
powers of endurance were taxed to the uttermost, moved off
the road from time to time, and burned and ravaged whatever
they could reach.<a id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">1388</a></p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg345" class="sidenote">Caesar
crosses
the
Thames.</div>

<p>Caesar had ascertained that the Thames, in that part of
its course which formed the southern boundary of the territory
of Cassivellaunus, was only fordable at one spot; and
since the time of Camden it has generally been supposed
that this was close to Halliford,&mdash;the only place, it is said,
between Hurleyford, about two miles west of Great Marlow,
and the sea, whose name preserves the memory of an ancient
ford.<a id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">1389</a> Evidence, however, has lately been adduced which
makes it more probable that Caesar was describing Brentford;
for, though the name may only have denoted a ford
over the Brent, in this part only of the lower Thames have
piles been discovered in dredging operations which could
reasonably be identified with the obstacles that threatened
the passage of the Roman army.<a id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">1390</a> When the column
descended into the valley, Caesar found that Cassivellaunus
had anticipated him. The further bank was fenced by a
row of sharp stakes, behind which were massed Cassivellaunus’s
tribesmen; and Caesar learned from prisoners and
deserters that similar stakes, concealed by the water, were
planted in the bed of the river. He sent his cavalry behind
cover to swim the stream close by; and at the right moment
the column of infantry plunged into the water, and advanced
to the attack. Caesar had calculated that the British levies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
would be distracted by the onset of the cavalry upon their
flanks and rear; but the infantry were determined to have
the credit for themselves. We may suppose that, while
they were removing the stakes, the slingers and archers
harassed the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">1391</a> ‘The infantry,’ wrote Caesar, ‘advanced
with such swiftness and dash, though they had only
their heads above water, that the enemy, unable to withstand
the combined onset of cavalry and infantry, abandoned
the bank and fled.’<a id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">1392</a></p>

<p>But Cassivellaunus did not despair. Before Caesar crossed

four petty kings of Kent to raise all their tribesmen
instantly and make a sudden attack upon the naval camp.<a id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">1393</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Caesar was moving eastward into the country

of the Trinovantes. Cassivellaunus haunted his line of
march as before, and pursued the same harassing tactics;
but the legionaries succeeded in doing considerable damage.
When, however, they crossed the frontier of the Trinovantes,
Caesar was careful to restrain them from committing any act
of violence. The Trinovantes punctually handed over the
hostages and delivered the grain which Caesar had required
from them; and several other tribes which had joined the
defensive league, seeing that they had been rewarded for their
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg346c" class="sidenote">Five of the confederate tribes submit.</span>
submission, sent envoys to announce their surrender. These
tribes were the Cenimagni, the Segontiaci, the Ancalites, the
Bibroci, and the Cassi. The last three do not reappear in
history: they were evidently dependent tribes, and nothing
is known about their geographical position except that
they lived somewhere in the basin of the Thames, on the
west or possibly on the north of the Trinovantian territory
in Essex.<a id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">1394</a> The territory of the Segontiaci, judging by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
coins, may have been conterminous with, and was probably
north of that of the Atrebates,<a id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">1395</a> who occupied parts of Hampshire
and Berkshire.<a id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">1396</a> The Cenimagni may have been the
people who dwelt in Suffolk and Norfolk,<a id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">1397</a> and who, under
the name of Eceni or Iceni, rose in revolt under Boadicea,
a century later, against the Romans. The envoys told
Caesar that the stronghold of Cassivellaunus was not far off,
and that a large number of the inhabitants with their flocks
and herds had taken refuge in it. Possibly it was Verulamium,
near St. Albans,<a id="FNanchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">1398</a> which was in later times the capital of the
son and successor of Cassivellaunus, though Caesar seems to
imply that there was no permanent settlement within the
fortress: at any rate it was not far west of the river Lea,
which formed the boundary of the Trinovantes. When
Caesar arrived, he found that the stronghold was protected
by woods and marshes, and fortified with a rampart and
trench: but the legions, advancing on two sides, speedily
carried the place by assault: many of the Britons, as they
were endeavouring to escape, were caught and killed; and
all their cattle were taken.</p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg347" class="sidenote">Attack

<p>Meanwhile the counter-attack which Cassivellaunus had
ordered had been delivered. The extent of the naval camp,
enclosing as it did several hundred vessels, might appear
disproportionate to the slender force to which Caesar had
entrusted its defence; but he had made no miscalculation.
Probably the entrenchment was protected at intervals by
towers like those which he used to strengthen his lines at
Alesia, and from which artillery could play upon the flanks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
of the assailants. A chieftain named Lugotorix was chosen
to lead the assault; but the garrison made a sortie, beat
off the Britons with considerable loss, and captured their
commander.</p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg348" class="sidenote">Caesar’s
hurried
journey
to the
coast and
its significance.</div>

<p>It was perhaps just after this event that Caesar, accompanied
by a flying column, made a journey to the coast, of
which he omits all mention in the <cite>Commentaries</cite>. His
silence, which can hardly have been unintentional, certainly
suggests that the news of the attack&mdash;perhaps the information
that it was about to be delivered&mdash;caused him serious
anxiety. On the 5th of August (the 1st of September of the
unreformed calendar) he wrote a letter from the naval camp
to Marcus Cicero. A service of dispatch vessels had been
organized, which plied from time to time between the Kentish
coast and the Portus Itius. Caesar had found time to write
at least once before; and the younger Cicero had sent a long
series of letters to his brother, whose allusions to them reveal
something of the inner history of the campaign. In the
first week of August he replied to the one which had described
the safe arrival of the armada:&mdash;‘How I rejoiced at your
letter from Britain. I was nervous about the sea and the
coast of that island. I don’t underrate what you have still
to do; but there is more ground for hope than fear.’<a id="FNanchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">1399</a> On the
1st of September he dispatched a long letter, written in instalments,
in which he acknowledged the receipt of four successive
letters:&mdash;‘I gather from yours,’ he said, ‘that we have
no occasion either for fear or exultation.’<a id="FNanchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">1400</a> The letter to
which he here alludes&mdash;the first of the series&mdash;was written
before the 16th of July, that is to say, while the construction
of the naval camp was still going on. Caesar’s first letter was
written in a spirit so friendly that it gave him the keenest
pleasure, mingled with pain; for he knew that Caesar
could not long remain in ignorance of the death of his
daughter, Julia, the wife of Pompey. Towards the end of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
letter of September 1 he says, ‘Caesar wrote me a letter on
the 5th of August, which reached me on the 31st, satisfactory
enough as regards affairs in Britain, in which, to prevent my
wondering at not getting one from you, he tells me that you
were not with him when he reached the coast.’<a id="FNanchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">1401</a> Caesar did
not, it would seem, write again until the 29th of August, after
which about a fortnight elapsed before he quitted the island;
and it is hardly credible that he should have spent more than
five weeks inactive at the sea. The only conclusion is that
he had some urgent motive for leaving the main body of his
army and undertaking a journey of seventy miles, and that
this journey was connected with the attack upon the camp.
Perhaps he desired to see for himself that the defences were
secure against any future attempt, to reinforce the garrison,
and to ascertain what progress had been made in the repair
of the fleet.<a id="FNanchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">1402</a></p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg349" class="sidenote">Cassivellaunus
sues for
peace.</div>

<p>But Cassivellaunus had by this time begun to lose heart.
His country had been harried without mercy; his people
had been dragged off by hundreds to be sold as slaves; and&mdash;what
he valued most of all&mdash;his cattle had been taken
away from him. Discredited by reverses, he had not been
able to hold his ill-assorted confederates together; their
defection left him powerless to retrieve his fortunes; and
his last great stroke had failed. He therefore sent envoys to
the Roman camp to propose surrender, and requested Commius
to negotiate for him.<a id="FNanchor_1403" href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">1403</a> Caesar, on his part, was glad
to be able to leave the island with a semblance of success.
He had originally intended to winter in Britain and renew
the war in the following spring. But Labienus had just
warned him that the outlook in Gaul was threatening: the
season for campaigning was nearly at an end; and he was
aware that Cassivellaunus could still maintain a guerrilla
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
warfare. He was obliged therefore to content himself with
demanding hostages, fixing a sum which the tribes that had
belonged to the league were to pay annually as tribute to
Rome, and admonishing Cassivellaunus to leave the Trinovantes
and their king unmolested.</p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg350" class="sidenote">Caesar
and his
army
return
to Gaul.</div>

<p>The hostages were handed over without delay; and Caesar,
with his army and his train of captives, marched back to the
coast. He found all the ships which it had been possible to
repair ready for sea: but the number of those which had
been condemned was not inconsiderable; and, as the prisoners
were very numerous, he determined to effect the transport in
two successive trips. With the first convoy went one of his
couriers, bearing letters from him and Quintus to the elder
Cicero. Their purport is preserved in one of Cicero’s letters
to Atticus:&mdash;‘On the 26th of September I received letters from
my brother Quintus and from Caesar, dated from the nearest
coasts of Britain on the 29th of August. They had settled
affairs in Britain, received hostages, and imposed tribute,
though they had got no booty, and were on the point of bringing
the army back.’<a id="FNanchor_1404" href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">1404</a> Caesar expected that when the empty
transports returned, they would be accompanied by sixty
ships, which had just been launched by Labienus; but only
a few either of the old or the new vessels arrived, the rest
having been driven back by contrary winds. Day after
day Caesar waited for them with increasing anxiety; for
the equinoctial gales might soon be expected. At length he
made up his mind that he could wait no longer. The few
available vessels were inconveniently crowded: but the sea
was perfectly smooth, and, leaving the Kentish coast between
<span class="sidenote">About Sept. 15.</span>
nine and ten at night, the fleet rowed into the harbour at
break of day. In spite of all the perils to which they had
been exposed in their numerous voyages, not a man had been
lost at sea, not a ship had foundered in either year.</p>

<p>While Caesar was still in Britain he had begun to collect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
materials for a description of the island and of the manners
<span id="PI_CVII_Pg351" class="sidenote">Caesar’s description of Britain.</span>
and customs of its inhabitants. Partly, indeed, it may have
been based upon the account of the Greek historian, Timaeus,
who had himself derived material from the journal of
Pytheas;<a id="FNanchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">1405</a> but certain sentences embodied the results of his
own observation. What specially struck him as he marched
through the country was the density of the population and
the superiority in material civilization of the people of Kent.
‘The population,’ he wrote, ‘is immense: homesteads, closely
resembling those of the Gauls, are met with at every turn;
and cattle are very numerous.’<a id="FNanchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">1406</a> His curiosity was excited
by the statement, which he had seen in one of his Greek
authorities, and the origin of which we have already endeavoured
to trace,<a id="FNanchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">1407</a> that in some of the islands off the mainland
there was continuous night for a month about the winter
solstice. ‘Our inquiries,’ he tells us, ‘could elicit no
information on the subject; but by accurate measurements
with a water-clock we ascertained that the nights were
shorter than on the Continent.’<a id="FNanchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">1408</a> It would be useless to guess
from what authority he derived the puzzling statement that
groups of ten or twelve men had wives in common, brothers
sharing with one another and fathers with their sons;<a id="FNanchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">1409</a> in
other words, that one of the British customs was polyandry.
Thoughtless commentators have condemned the passage as
simply untrue: it has been explained as the outcome of a
misunderstanding; and an eminent scholar, with a theory
that needed every support, has insisted that it was merely
a blundering description of the primitive institution of
matriarchy, which he believed to have survived among the
Picts of a later time.<a id="FNanchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">1410</a> We can only be sure that neither
matriarchy nor polyandry existed among the dominant
Celts; but it is permissible to suppose that certain primitive
communities in remote districts had some usage which gave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
colour to Caesar’s statement. But perhaps the most remarkable
feature in his description was the approximate
accuracy of his estimate of the size of the island. He was
told that its circumference was two thousand miles; and
this information was certainly not derived either directly or
indirectly from Pytheas, whose estimate, if Strabo has
reported it correctly, was monstrously exaggerated.<a id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">1411</a> On
the other hand, Caesar, although, like Pytheas, he placed
Ireland in its true position, imagined, in common with other
geographers who derided Pytheas’s teaching, that the Gallic
coast, from the Rhine to the Pyrenees, was roughly parallel
with Southern Britain.<a id="FNanchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">1412</a></p>

<div id="PI_CVII_Pg352" class="sidenote">Review of
Caesar’s
invasions
of Britain.</div>

<p>The story of these invasions is not without interest for
students of military history. In Britain Caesar was confronted
by tactical problems of an entirely strange kind;
and he did not dissemble the difficulty which he had experienced
in attempting to solve them. The Roman
soldiers had been trained to encounter an enemy who
fought in close order; if ever, in the stress of unforeseen
circumstances, such as those which beset the foragers of the
7th legion, they found themselves cut off from the standards
which they were accustomed to rally round, they felt that
they were but the units of a mob.<a id="FNanchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">1413</a> It was not perhaps
that they lacked the intelligence which enabled the German
soldier in 1870 to adapt himself to new conditions. The
coolness with which, in the fearful combat with the Nervii,
each legionary shook off the effects of his surprise, and,
disentangling himself from the press, ‘fell in by the standard
he first caught sight of,’<a id="FNanchor_1414" href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">1414</a> and fought as steadily as under his
own centurion, shows that in Caesar’s soldiers no moral,
as no physical, military qualification was wanting. But
encompassed by those rushing chariots, assailed by those
nimble groups of skirmishers who would not come to sword’s
point with them, they found themselves helpless. And
when they advanced with ranks closed&mdash;for the enemy never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
succeeded in breaking their formation&mdash;the charioteers
could easily keep out of the way and concentrate the whole
weight of their attack upon the cavalry, which they had
lured away from their support. Cassivellaunus handled
his levies with commendable skill; and if he did not deserve
from Caesar the admiration that makes itself felt in the terse
chapters which mirror the tremendous personality of Vercingetorix,
he was a leader of no ordinary capacity, raised
to his high place by merit alone. For the mistake which
gave Trebonius the opportunity of dealing him that staggering
blow near the banks of the Stour&mdash;the rush of his
tribesmen, intoxicated by success, upon the ranks of the
legions&mdash;not his lack of judgement but their lack of discipline
was responsible. And if, instead of disbanding his infantry
and following Caesar’s march with his chariots, he had then
had the hardihood to let Caesar go his way, and, leaving his
cattle, his homesteads, and his granaries to their fate, had
hurled his entire force, combined with the levies of the
Kentish kings, against the little garrison which held the
naval camp, it might have gone hardly with Caesar. For,
like the weak cohorts with which Galba strove to hold his
camp in the Valais against a host of mountaineers, the
garrison would have been compelled to defend themselves
without respite against assailants whose numbers enabled
them to fight and rest by turns; and if, like Galba’s men,
they had attempted to disperse their enemies by a sortie,
they would have been attacked in flank and rear by the
charioteers and cavalry. Perhaps, indeed, Cassivellaunus
saw what to do, but was not sufficiently master of his countrymen
to do it. He who can keep in hand an aggregate of
levies, shattered by defeat in a regular combat which they
should never have fought, must needs be a king of men.
Caesar understood the weaknesses of half-civilized tribes,
and knew what risks he might fairly run. Just as Vercingetorix
was compelled by his tribesmen to let go his hold upon
the country of the Bituriges, where he barred Caesar’s advance,
and to leave the way open to him by returning to
succour their farms, so Cassivellaunus, we may be sure,
would not have been able to withstand the clamours that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
would have bidden him go to the rescue of the threatened
dominions of the Catuvellauni and their allies, even if, by
sacrificing them, he could have cut the invaders’ communications,
and detained him a prisoner in Britain. One may
be allowed perhaps to speculate whether Caesar, if he had
himself had much experience of British tactics in his first
expedition, would have been able, without sacrificing the
advantage of discipline, to train his troops in the intervening
winter to adapt their formation to the methods of
attack which they had to expect; or whether it would have
been possible for him then, as it was two years later, to enlist
the invaluable aid of German cavalry: but in his second
campaign he speedily corrected the mistakes which his sanguine
temperament had led him to make; and in his mode
of conducting the war he conformed so closely to the
maxims which the foremost British soldier of our time,
himself an enthusiastic admirer of the <cite>Commentaries</cite>, has
laid down for generals who have to command against
uncivilized enemies,<a id="FNanchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">1415</a> that one might almost suppose those
maxims to have been derived from a study of the campaign.
By marching in the night to seek out his enemy after his
disembarkation, he gained the advantage which is the reward
of a secretly-planned, sudden, and swift movement against
an undisciplined foe. Instantly following up his success, he
taught the fugitives that the strongholds which kept their
own countrymen at bay were of little avail against Roman
soldiers. As soon as he was free to advance into the interior,
he demoralized his enemies by rapidity of movement and
incessant energy; and by ruthlessly destroying their crops,
seizing the stores upon which they depended for subsistence,
and driving off the cattle, which were their most valued
possession, he succeeded, within a few weeks, in bringing the
campaign, which fortune would not permit him to continue,
to a successful conclusion.

</div></div>

<p>is only worth quoting as an instance of the poet’s animosity;
but the impression left by the various passages which refer
to Caesar’s expeditions is, that public expectation, having
been wrought up to a high pitch, had suffered disappointment.<a id="FNanchor_1417" href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">1417</a>
Everybody knew that Caesar had not incurred the
vast expense of his second expedition merely for plunder or
to deter the Britons from aiding the Gauls: they gathered
from his own book that he had aimed at conquest; and
they could see no more than that he had failed. Tacitus
came nearest to the truth when he said that ‘Julius, though
by a successful engagement he struck terror into the inhabitants
and gained possession of the coast, must be regarded
as having indicated rather than transmitted the acquisition
to posterity’.<a id="FNanchor_1418" href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">1418</a> But even this judgement was based upon
imperfect knowledge; and the tendency of modern historians,
including the greatest scholar of them all, has been
to underrate the importance of what Caesar had achieved.</p>

<p>For although Caesar had failed to achieve his aim, he had
opened a new world to his countrymen; had proved the
facility with which it could be conquered; and had done all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
that opportunity permitted to pave the way for the conquest.
He directed the course of British history into a new channel.
He forced the most civilized peoples of the island to acknowledge
the supremacy of Rome, and made it clear to those of
them who could read the signs of the times that the enforcement
of that supremacy would not be long delayed. He
impressed upon them such respect for the Roman power that
the avowed object with which he had invaded the country
was effectually gained:&mdash;the Britons ceased to abet the
resistance of their kinsmen on the other side of the Channel.
He showed that the key to the conquest was to take advantage
of the jealousy between the family of Cassivellaunus and
their rivals. In the presence of these facts, the question
whether the tribute which he imposed was ever actually paid
is merely academical; but the great scholar who required
us to believe that ‘it is certain that the stipulated tribute was
never paid’<a id="FNanchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">1419</a> made an assertion which is not only improbable
but is opposed to such evidence as we possess. Mommsen
did not fully appreciate the severity of the punishment which
had been inflicted upon Cassivellaunus, or the hold over him
which Caesar could exert through his hostages. It is
probable indeed that Diodorus,<a id="FNanchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">1420</a> when he said that Caesar
forced the Britons to pay tribute, was only putting his own
construction upon Caesar’s words: but what is certain is
that the Britons, although in the reign of Augustus they
were not required to pay tribute, were obliged to pay duties
at the Gallic harbours upon the goods which they exported to
and imported from Gaul; and it is not unreasonable to
conjecture that these charges may have been imposed as an
equivalent for a tribute which could no longer have been
collected except by an irresistible army.<a id="FNanchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">1421</a> But the influence
which Caesar exercised upon the destinies of Britain was
communicated chiefly through Gaul. In the three years
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
which followed his departure the Britons saw the conquest
of Gaul completed: while the civil war ran its course they
saw that Gaul made no effort to throw off the Roman yoke;
and as time passed and the provinces settled down in the
grasp of Augustus, they saw that Gaul was incorporated in
the Roman Empire. Meanwhile in Britain the history of
Gaul was being enacted over again. In the earlier half of
the first century before our era Roman traders, settled in
Gallic towns, had prepared the way for the legions of Julius:
in the later half Roman or Romanized traders who found it
profitable to deal with Britain prepared the way for the
legions of Claudius.</p>

<div id="PI_CVIII_Pg357" class="sidenote">Development
of
British
commerce.</div>

<p>In Strabo’s time the Britons still imported ornaments of
various kinds from the Continent, vases of amber and glass,
gold necklets, and ivory for the decoration of horse trappings.
Among their exports were slaves, which shows that intertribal
warfare was still rife, and, if Strabo’s statement is to
be taken literally, corn, cattle, and iron.<a id="FNanchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">1422</a> Representations
of horned cattle, sheep, and pigs are found so often upon
British coins<a id="FNanchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">1423</a> that we can easily understand how the graziers
should have been able to spare of their abundance; but,
although ears of corn are figured on some of Cunobeline’s
coins,<a id="FNanchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">1424</a> it requires more faith to believe that the population
by whose density Caesar was amazed grew enough corn to
satisfy not only their own requirements, but those of their
continental neighbours, and that the Gauls, whose resources
were sufficient to enable them to feed Caesar’s army, were
obliged to import grain. One would have supposed too
that the output of the Gallic iron mines, which Caesar
mentions, would not have required to be supplemented from
Britain; and that the iron-workers of the Weald had
enough to do in supplying the wants of their own countrymen.
But, though Britain was not as opulent as Gaul, it
would seem that some of the chiefs in the southern and
eastern districts amassed a considerable amount of wealth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">1425</a> tells us that Prasutagus, who was king of the Iceni
about 60 A.D., was renowned for his riches; and, like Dumnorix
the Aeduan, he may have acquired them in part from
tolls. It has been maintained that the tin trade, which had
once been so flourishing, and which certainly flourished
during the later period of the Roman occupation, ceased
about the beginning of the Christian era, and was suspended
for the next two hundred years: but the mere absence of
ingots of tin bearing the Roman stamp is hardly sufficient
to establish a theory which, intrinsically, is so improbable;
and it seems more reasonable to conclude that the mines were
continuously worked, but not until the third century under
Roman control.<a id="FNanchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">1426</a></p>

<p>But the notices of Britain which appear in the writings of
Strabo and Diodorus are the least important sources of our
knowledge. More valuable is the systematic classification
of British coins which has been accomplished during the
last fifty years. They show how thoroughly Roman ideas
had permeated British civilization before the legions returned
to the island, and enable us to trace in outline the course of
British political history during the century that elapsed
between the departure of Julius and the invasion of Claudius
Caesar. Soon after the former event the numismatic art
of Britain entered upon its second period. Coins of silver,
copper, bronze, and tin were now coming into use;<a id="FNanchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">1427</a> and the
need that was beginning to be felt for small change testifies
to an advance in material civilization. On the site of Verulamium
have been found gold coins of two values, silver of
one, and bronze of three.<a id="FNanchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">1428</a> Perhaps we must also regard as
a sign of progress increased ingenuity in fraud: at all events
besides the authorized mints there were forgers, who made
a living by passing coins of base metal thinly plated with
gold.<a id="FNanchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">1429</a> Uninscribed coins were still struck, especially in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
remoter districts,<a id="FNanchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">1430</a> and remained in circulation in the time
of Claudius;<a id="FNanchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">1431</a> but from about 30 <small>B.C.</small> the greater number of
new coins bore the name either of the prince or of the tribe in
whose territories they were minted, and in some cases also
the name of the town in which the mint was situated. This
evidence shows that Verulamium and Camulodunum were
the chief political centres of Southern Britain;<a id="FNanchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">1432</a> and it is
remarkable that the name of Londinium, although it may
even then have been the chief commercial town, as it certainly
was from the very beginning of the Roman occupation,<a id="FNanchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">1433</a> does
not appear upon any British coin which has yet come to
light.<a id="FNanchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">1434</a> The earliest of the inscribed coins naturally belonged
to the south-eastern parts of the country:<a id="FNanchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">1435</a> the northern
tribe of the Brigantes were the last to adopt them;<a id="FNanchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">1436</a> and not
a single specimen has been discovered which can be assigned
to the Durotriges.<a id="FNanchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">1437</a> Of the course of events in the northern
and western regions history tells us nothing, and coins but
little: indeed there is no evidence that the tribes of Scotland,
Wales, Northumberland, Durham, Cumberland, Westmorland,
Shropshire, Devonshire, and Cornwall even now had
coins at all;<a id="FNanchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">1438</a> and it was not until some time after Caesar’s
departure that the inhabitants of Gloucestershire, northern
Wiltshire, and Somersetshire began to use them.<a id="FNanchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">1439</a> Probably
the iron bars which have been already described were still
current<a id="FNanchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">1440</a> in the midlands and the west; and Solinus affirmed
that in his time the people of the Scilly Islands refused money
and traded by barter.<a id="FNanchor_1441" href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">1441</a> Coins bearing the simple inscription,

been found in Worcestershire, Monmouthshire, Somersetshire,
Devonshire, and Cornwall;<a id="FNanchor_1442" href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">1442</a> and it has been hastily
concluded that some of the remoter British tribes, like many
of those of Gaul, had expelled their kings.<a id="FNanchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">1443</a> But our most
experienced numismatist thinks that the inscription represents
the name of the prince by whom the coins were
minted;<a id="FNanchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">1444</a> and one would be inclined to believe that the more
backward north and west were then, as they were sixteen centuries
later, the strongholds of conservatism.<a id="FNanchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">1445</a> The evidence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
which relates to Southern Britain is less flimsy; and it
points to the conclusion that the course of events in that
part of the country was leading inevitably to the Roman
conquest.</p>

dynasties
of Cassivellaunus

<p>The history of Southern Britain in this period, if we disregard
Dorsetshire, Devonshire, and Cornwall, is the history
of two dynasties,&mdash;that of Caesar’s old antagonist, Cassivellaunus,
and that of his old ally, Commius. Of the later life
of Cassivellaunus nothing is known; but it would seem
probable that the recollection of the punishment which
the legions had inflicted upon him and the knowledge that
his hostages were in Caesar’s power were sufficient to induce
him to obey Caesar’s last injunction and to leave the Trinovantes
<span id="PI_CVIII_Pg361b" class="sidenote">Tasciovanus.</span>
and their king, Mandubracius, unmolested. About
30 <small>B.C.</small>, or perhaps a few years earlier, he was succeeded by
his son, Tasciovanus.<a id="FNanchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">1446</a> The earlier coins of this prince were
purely British in character; but those of later date are
adorned with the figures of Pegasus and centaurs, while one
of them is imitated from a coin of Augustus, which was first
struck in 13 <small>B.C.</small>;<a id="FNanchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">1447</a> and their number and variety are so
great that the reign of Tasciovanus must have extended
over a long period,&mdash;not improbably until about <small>A.D.</small> 5.<a id="FNanchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">1448</a> His
dominions, which were perhaps originally confined to the
country of the Catuvellauni, in whose capital, Verulamium,
most of his coins were struck, ultimately included, it should
seem, not only those of the Trinovantes, but also of the
<span id="PI_CVIII_Pg361c" class="sidenote">Epaticcus and Cunobeline.</span>
Segontiaci and parts of Northamptonshire.<a id="FNanchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">1449</a> He left several
sons, among whom were Epaticcus and Cunobeline. The
coins of the former, which bear the abbreviated Latin inscription
<small>TASC. FIL.</small>&mdash;‘son of Tasciovanus’&mdash;have all been found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
either in the western part of Surrey or the east of Wiltshire;
and it has been inferred that he either succeeded to the
western portion of his father’s dominions or conquered
territory which had never been subject to him.<a id="FNanchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">1450</a> Epaticcus
was, however, completely overshadowed by his brother,
who, under the name of Cymbeline, has been immortalized
by Shakespeare. There may perhaps be a kernel of truth
in the statement of Geoffrey of Monmouth, that he was
<span id="PI_CVIII_Pg362a" class="sidenote">Cunobeline’s coins prove growth of Roman influence in Britain.</span>
educated by Augustus:<a id="FNanchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">1451</a> at all events his silver and copper
coins bear witness to the growing influence of Roman culture;
and many of them must have been designed either by
Romans or by artists who had received Roman training.
One of his silver coins, in the opinion of the highest authority,
is characterized by exquisite workmanship, ‘worthy of a
Greek artist;’<a id="FNanchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">1452</a> and some of them suggest that not long after
the commencement of the Christian era the worship of
Hercules had been introduced into Britain.<a id="FNanchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">1453</a> Not one of
the coins bearing his name which have so far been discovered
was struck at the mint of Verulamium, from which, as we
have seen, those of his father had mainly issued: the name
of Camulodunum appears upon them all; and the conclusion
seems warranted that he inherited the eastern part of his
<span id="PI_CVIII_Pg362b" class="sidenote">His conquests.</span>
father’s dominions, and extended them by subduing the
Trinovantes,&mdash;the hereditary enemies of his family.<a id="FNanchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">1454</a> It is
not improbable that he had begun to reign about 5 <small>B.C.</small>,
while his father was still alive; and that he conquered the
Trinovantes before his father died.<a id="FNanchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">1455</a> The area which was
under his immediate rule when he was at the height of his

<div id="PI_CVIII_Pg363" class="sidenote">Flight of
Dubnovellaunus
and
Tincommius(?),
the son of

<p>Cunobeline’s conquest of the Trinovantes appears to have
been one of the causes which led to the flight, briefly
chronicled by Augustus on the monument of Ancyra,<a id="FNanchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">1459</a>
of two British princes who sought for Roman aid. Their
names, as recorded on the stone, were <small>DVMNOBELLAV</small>[<i>nus</i>],
and, if we are to accept the testimony of Chishull,<a id="FNanchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">1460</a> an
antiquary of a past generation, <small>TIM</small>.... The name of the
former, as it is spelled on British coins, was Dubnovellaunos.
Those of his coins which appear to have been circulated
earliest have been found only in Kent, which he probably
at one time ruled.<a id="FNanchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">1461</a> His later coins tend to show that he
afterwards annexed the territory of the Trinovantes, from
which he was in his turn expelled by Cunobeline.<a id="FNanchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">1462</a> But who
was the prince who with him undertook the long journey to
Rome? The letters <small>TIM</small>, if indeed <small>M</small> was really graven upon
the monument, were of course only the first three of another
name; and it is possible that Chishull may have mistaken
one or perhaps two broken letters for <small>M</small>, or, since <small>M</small> and <small>N</small>
were often confused, that the engraver may have been misled
by his copy.<a id="FNanchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">1463</a> Be this as it may, there is only one known
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
name with which <small>TIM</small> ... can be identified,&mdash;that of Tincommius,
who called himself on some of his coins <small>TINCOM</small>[<i>mios</i>]
<small>COMMI FILI</small>[<i>us</i>] <small>REX</small><a id="FNanchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">1464</a>&mdash;‘King Tincommius, son of Commius.’
In order to understand the history of Tincommius, we must
trace the later career of the Commius who was, beyond all
reasonable doubt, his father,<a id="FNanchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">1465</a>&mdash;the king of the Atrebates
who had accompanied Caesar to Britain.</p>

<div id="PI_CVIII_Pg364" class="sidenote">The later
adventures
of
Commius.</div>

<p>Commius had of course been liberally rewarded for his
services: but in the great Gallic insurrection of 52 <small>B.C.</small> he
had thrown in his lot with Vercingetorix; and he was one
of the four generals to whose joint direction was entrusted the
command of the Pan-Gallic host which marched to relieve
the latter when he was beleaguered in Alesia. ‘Caesar,’ we
read in the seventh <cite>Commentary</cite>, ‘had found Commius a
loyal and serviceable agent in former years in Britain; and,
in acknowledgement of these services, he had granted his
tribe immunity from forced contributions, restored to it its
rights and laws, and placed the Morini under his authority.
Yet so intense was the unanimous determination of the
entire Gallic people to vindicate their liberty and recover
their ancient military renown, that no favours, no recollection
of former friendship, had any influence with them, but
all devoted their energies and resources to the prosecution of
the war.’<a id="FNanchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">1466</a> Patriotism, however, was not the only motive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
of Commius: he had a reason for the bitterness of his hostility,
which Caesar does not mention, but which we learn
from Caesar’s friend, Aulus Hirtius, who wrote the last of
the <cite>Commentaries on the Gallic War</cite>. In the winter of
53-52 <small>B.C.</small>, while Caesar was absent in Cisalpine Gaul,
Commius took an active part in forming the nucleus of the
coalition of which Vercingetorix was destined to be the leader;
and Labienus, who found out his designs, commissioned the
tribune Volusenus to assassinate him. Commius escaped
with a severe wound; and in the year which followed the
overthrow of Vercingetorix he formed, in conjunction with
a chief of the Bellovaci, a fresh coalition against Caesar,
who was obliged to exert all his strength in order to subdue
it. For some time Commius led the life of a brigand chief,
and succeeded in capturing several convoys which were on
their way to Caesar’s winter camp in the country of the
Atrebates. He made himself so formidable that Mark
Antony sent Volusenus to make a second attempt to kill him;
and although he again escaped, he ultimately surrendered
on the express condition that he should never again be
brought face to face with any Roman.</p>

<div id="PI_CVIII_Pg365a" class="sidenote">His conquests
in
Britain.</div>

<p>When and why Commius took up his abode in Britain is
not known; but some probability may be claimed for the
conjecture that his motive was to check the encroachments
of the Catuvellauni.<a id="FNanchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">1467</a> No coins have been found which can
with absolute certainty be ascribed to him:<a id="FNanchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">1468</a> but it is
admitted that he issued coins before Tasciovanus, who, as we
have seen, began to reign at least as early as 30 <small>B.C.</small>;<a id="FNanchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">1469</a> and
before his death he became overlord of the maritime tribes of
South-Eastern Britain on the right bank of the Thames.<a id="FNanchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">1470</a> He
<span id="PI_CVIII_Pg365b" class="sidenote">Tincommius, Verica, and Eppillus.</span>
left three sons, Tincommius, Verica, and Eppillus; and almost
all their coins have been found in Kent, Sussex, Surrey, and
Hampshire.<a id="FNanchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">1471</a> Each of these sons described himself on his coins
as <small>REX</small>, and each of them appears to have had a kingdom of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
his own, Tincommius ruling the Regni, who inhabited Sussex,
Eppillus the Cantii, and Verica the Atrebates.<a id="FNanchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">1472</a> The dominions
of Verica cannot, however, be certainly defined. There
is some reason to suppose that he held sway over the Atrebates
of Belgium as well as over those of Britain; for certain coins
found in the north of France, and closely resembling others
that are common in the south-eastern counties of England,
are inscribed with a monogram which appears to denote the
abbreviation <small>VE</small>.<a id="FNanchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">1473</a> It should seem that Eppillus, at some
time, was king of the Atrebates, for some of his coins have
the legend <small>CALLEV</small>,&mdash;an abbreviated form of Calleva, the
chief town of that tribe.<a id="FNanchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">1474</a> Certain coins, however, exist
which apparently bear the names of all the three brothers,
a fact which can only be explained on the theory that at one
time they exercised a joint sovereignty over the dominions
which had belonged to their father;<a id="FNanchor_1475" href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">1475</a> while others are inscribed
with the names of Verica and Eppillus only.<a id="FNanchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">1476</a> It has been
assumed that these coins were not struck until after the
death of Tincommius;<a id="FNanchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">1477</a> but another explanation seems
possible. Why did Tincommius, alone of the three brothers,
solicit the protection of Augustus, and why did he undertake
the journey to Rome in conjunction with Dubnovellaunus?
Numismatic evidence has led to the belief that Dubnovellaunus
had once ruled over the Cantii;<a id="FNanchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">1478</a> and if so, Eppillus,
who afterwards acquired dominion over the same tribe,
probably dispossessed him. Dubnovellaunus, as we have
already seen, appears to have once ruled over the Trinovantes
as well, and to have been expelled from their country by
Cunobeline. These successive reverses may have been the
motive for the journey which he undertook to Rome; and
when we consider that certain coins bear the names of
Eppillus and Verica, without that of Tincommius, which on
others appears side by side with theirs, it seems possible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
that Tincommius, finding that his brothers were leagued
together against him, threw in his lot with another prince
who had been as unfortunate as himself. This conjecture
is perhaps somewhat strengthened by the fact that one of
the coins of Tincommius bears, along with <small>TIN</small>&mdash;the abbreviated
form of his name&mdash;the inscription <small>DV</small>,<a id="FNanchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">1479</a> which has
baffled the acumen of numismatists, but which, on the
analogy of <small>TC</small>&mdash;one of the abbreviations of <small>TINCOMMIOS</small><a id="FNanchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">1480</a>&mdash;may
possibly stand for <small>DUBNOVELLAUNOS</small>.<a id="FNanchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">1481</a></p>

<p>How the fugitives were received we are not told; but it
is certain that Augustus did not grant them armed assistance;
nor is there any evidence that they ever recovered power.
<span id="PI_CVIII_Pg367a" class="sidenote">Augustus contemplates an invasion of Britain.</span>
As early as 34 <small>B.C.</small> Augustus had marched into Gaul with
the intention, as was generally believed, of invading Britain;
but, owing to an insurrection in Dalmatia, he was compelled
to abandon his resolve.<a id="FNanchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">1482</a> For several years, however, it was
expected that he would sooner or later complete the work
which his adoptive father had begun; and this expectation
was voiced in the poetry of the time. About the year 30 <small>B.C.</small>
Vergil<a id="FNanchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">1483</a> prayed that ‘far off Thule’ might obey Augustus;
and Horace, in odes which seem to have been officially
inspired, called upon Fortune to preserve him in his expedition
against the Britons, ‘remotest inhabitants of the world,’<a id="FNanchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">1484</a>
and foretold that when they and the Parthians were brought
under the imperial sway he would be hailed a god upon
earth.<a id="FNanchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">1485</a> In 27 and again in 26 <small>B.C.</small> Augustus marched into
Gaul with the ostensible purpose of invading Britain, but
again without result.<a id="FNanchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">1486</a> But the latest of these dates was
earlier than the flight of Tincommius and Dubnovellaunus;
and thenceforward Augustus abandoned all thought of
<span id="PI_CVIII_Pg367b" class="sidenote">Why he abandoned his intention.</span>
invading Britain.<a id="FNanchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">1487</a> The cause of his inaction is discernible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
in two passages of Strabo’s <cite>Geography</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">1488</a> which give the
official explanation of the imperial policy. The conquest
of Britain would be very costly; and it was unlikely that
the revenue would be more than sufficient to defray the
expense of the garrison and the administration: the duties
levied at the Gallic harbours on goods imported from and
exported to Britain were more productive than any tribute;
besides, Britain was too weak to be dangerous, and its conquest
was therefore unnecessary. Possibly we may gather
from the prominence which is given in the monument of
Ancyra to the petition of Tincommius and Dubnovellaunus
that it was officially interpreted as a sign of the virtual submission
of the Britons.</p>

<div id="PI_CVIII_Pg368a" class="sidenote">Continued

<p>This confidence indeed is not difficult to understand. The
conjecture that at the courts of Commius, of Tasciovanus,
and of Cunobeline Latin was the official speech<a id="FNanchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">1489</a> may perhaps
be somewhat rash: but at all events Latin was the language
of the mint; and perhaps it is not unreasonable to suppose
that, as some Pannonian Celts were versed in Latin literature,<a id="FNanchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">1490</a>
a Briton here and there was equally accomplished.

<p>With the sons of Commius the British coinage in the
districts which they had ruled, with the sole exception of
Kent, came to an end.<a id="FNanchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">1493</a> It may be that the inhabitants had
begun, like the Gauls with whom they traded, to use only
Roman money; but, as the coinage of Kent continued, the
more probable explanation would seem to be that they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
no longer able to make head against the King of the Catuvellauni.<a id="FNanchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">1494</a></p>

<p>Tincommius and Dubnovellaunus were not the only British
<span id="PI_CVIII_Pg369a" class="sidenote">Relations of Cunobeline with Rome.</span>
princes who paid their respects to the emperor. ‘In our
time,’ says Strabo, ‘various British chieftains gained the
friendship of Augustus Caesar by sending embassies and
performing services; placed votive offerings in the Capitol;
and made almost the whole island familiar to the Romans.’<a id="FNanchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">1495</a>
Among them, we can hardly doubt, was Cunobeline, whose
coins, like those of his father, testify that Roman mythology
had already taken root on British soil,<a id="FNanchor_1496" href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">1496</a> and who, according to
Geoffrey of Monmouth,<a id="FNanchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">1497</a> voluntarily paid tribute to Rome. If
there is any truth in Geoffrey’s statement, the tribute must
have been the price paid for moral support. During the reign
of Tiberius, who adhered to the conservative and moderate
policy of his stepfather, the relations of Cunobeline and of
Britain with Rome apparently remained unchanged: history
only relates that some soldiers of Germanicus, who had
been shipwrecked on the British coast, were sent back by
British princes.<a id="FNanchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">1498</a> It can hardly be doubted, however, that
the conquest of Britain was contemplated by Roman

<p>Within the next three years the great king died, leaving,
besides Adminius, three other sons who still remained in
Britain,&mdash;Caratacus, Togodumnus, and, as we may conjecture,
one Bericus, who fled over sea. Caratacus, whose name
is more familiar under the erroneous form Caractacus, was
the prince who in later years opposed a desperate resistance
to the Roman conquest of Western Britain. After Cunobeline’s
death he and Togodumnus assumed royal power, and
perhaps combined to exclude Bericus from any share in the

Bericus had some influence with the Iceni, who were
bitterly hostile to the dynasty of Cassivellaunus and his
successors, and were prepared to join the Romans if they
should invade the island. But another explanation has been
proposed. There are late coins of the Iceni which bear the
name of a prince named Antedrigus, who later still issued coins
which have been found in the territory of the Dobuni. It
has been suggested that, like the Treveran Indutiomarus
and his enemy Cingetorix,<a id="FNanchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">1503</a> Antedrigus and Bericus were the
leaders of rival factions of the Iceni; that Antedrigus prevailed;
that Bericus thereupon determined to seek Roman
aid; and that Antedrigus, when the Iceni joined the Romans,
sought an asylum among the Dobuni.<a id="FNanchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">1504</a> Anyhow Bericus

<p>Amid many uncertainties the facts of British history
which stand out prominently are these. The invasions of
Caesar, supported by his conquest of Gaul, stimulated trade
between the Britons and the Romanized Gauls, and thereby
brought Britain within the sphere of Roman influence;
encouraged those British princes who needed protection or
support to turn to Rome, and made them all look up to the
Emperor as a patron, who might eventually be their sovereign
lord. In the island itself Commius and his sons made themselves
supreme in the eastern districts south of the Thames;

that appertains to material civilization&mdash;herein we have

strengthened its hold upon the hearts of men? We have

<h2 id="PII">THE ETHNOLOGY OF ANCIENT BRITAIN</h2>

<h3 id="PII_Pg375">I. INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>The ethnology of ancient Britain has been studied from many
points of view. Writers of a past generation relied simply upon
the notices which are to be found in the works of Caesar, Strabo,
Tacitus, and other ancient writers. In the last century the science,
if it may now be so called, of physical anthropology came into
being. The barrows in which our prehistoric ancestors had buried
their dead were opened; and the skeletons which had been left in
them by earlier explorers were systematically measured. The
physical characters of the living population were noted as far as
possible in the hope that they might help to solve the problems of
the past. Archaeologists collected the pottery, the tools, the
weapons, and the ornaments which were found beneath the soil,
in the beds of rivers, in barrows, cairns, caves, earthworks, and
elsewhere, described them, classified them, and compared them with
those of other countries. Philologists studied the forms of the
Celtic dialects, and endeavoured to discover in them traces of dialects
older still. Finally, folk-lorists formed an association, and joined
the army of inquirers. The united efforts of all these seekers after
truth have stored up a huge mass of information; and those who
may read this article will, I believe, agree with me that there is no
reason to expect that any additional facts which may be ascertained
will throw much new light upon the questions which we are about
to consider:<a id="FNanchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">1512</a>
but no serious attempt has yet been made to co-ordinate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
the materials which exist. To do this is the aim of the
present article. If the problems of British ethnology can be solved,
history, physical anthropology, archaeology, and philology must
combine.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg376">II">THE METHODS OF ANTHROPOLOGY</h3>

<p>A lay reader who takes up a treatise on ethnology ought to understand
the methods by which anthropologists differentiate the various
human types. I may be allowed to reproduce a paragraph which
I wrote a few years ago in another volume, and to which I shall
have something to add.</p>

<p>‘Anthropologists are obliged to make use of technical terms,
more or less uncouth; and they are guided in their observations
by very precise and minute rules, framed with the object of eliminating,
as far as possible, the chance of error. But it is unnecessary
for my purpose to trouble the reader with more than a few of these
things. What I shall have to say about stature, complexion, hair
and eyes, will need no explanation; and in regard to the skull
I shall, as a rule, only have to deal with that measurement which
fixes the proportion between its length and its breadth. In this
measurement the length is represented by 100; and the proportion
which the breadth bears to the length is called the cephalic index.
Thus, if the breadth is four-fifths of the length, the index is 80.
According to the system formulated by the great French anthropologist,
Paul Broca,<a id="FNanchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">1513</a> skulls are grouped, according to the cephalic
index, in five classes. Skulls whose index exceeds 83·33 are brachycephalic;
those whose index falls between 83·33 and 80 are sub-brachycephalic;
those between 80 and 77·77 mesaticephalic; those
between 77·77 and 75 sub-dolichocephalic; and those below 75
dolichocephalic ... it is necessary to bear in mind that measurements
of living heads invariably yield a higher cephalic index&mdash;the
average difference being as much as 2&mdash;than those of skulls<a id="FNanchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">1514</a> [of
the same form]. Another important character of the skull or head
is <i>gnathism</i>, that is to say, the degree of projection of the upper jaw.
The word <i>orthognathous</i> denotes that this projection is comparatively
slight; for absolute orthognathism does not exist. The
remaining technical terms which it is necessary for general readers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
to understand are those which describe the structure of the nasal
skeleton. <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Platyrrhinian</i> means that it is wide, <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">mesorrhinian</i> intermediate,
and <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">leptorrhinian</i> narrow.’<a id="FNanchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">1515</a> I should have added that
the orbital index, which is important, denotes the relation of the
breadth of the orbit to its length; and, since we are dealing with
the ethnology of Britain, it will be convenient to adopt for cephalic
indices the notation which is prevalent in this country, and according
to which skulls whose indices exceed 80 are called brachycephalic,
those between 80 and 75 mesaticephalic, and those under 75 dolichocephalic.</p>

<p>The value of the cephalic index was for many years taken for
granted in all ethnological treatises; and many anthropologists
still lay great stress upon it.<a id="FNanchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">1516</a> But there has lately been a reaction.<a id="FNanchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">1517</a>
Professor Sergi<a id="FNanchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">1518</a> scoffs at ‘the old and discredited method of the
cephalic index, which only indicates artificial and conventional
distinctions’, and tells us that ‘it is the forms alone that we have
to take into consideration’,<a id="FNanchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">1519</a> and that ‘indices may serve to approximate
the most diverse forms and to separate the most homogeneous’.<a id="FNanchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">1520</a>
This last remark is unquestionably true; as Huxley said,
‘in nine cases out of ten you may diagnose an Australian skull [among
other dolichocephalic skulls] with certainty.’<a id="FNanchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">1521</a> Nevertheless the
cephalic index, used with discrimination, retains the value which
Broca, Beddoe, Collignon, Turner, and other anthropologists ascribe
to it; and those who are familiar with Sergi’s writings will not be
surprised to learn that, when it suits his purpose, he lays great stress
upon the distinction between dolichocephalic and brachycephalic
skulls.<a id="FNanchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">1522</a> He considerably modifies his view when he affirms the
truism that ‘we cannot accept the evidence of the cephalic index
when that evidence is contradicted by other important facts’;<a id="FNanchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">1523</a> but
if any one who has a taste for ethnology will spend a few days in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
walking through the department of Jura or the mountainous parts of
Auvergne, the contrast between the round heads which he will see
everywhere and the totally different type which he has been accustomed
to in his own country will convince him that the cephalic
index has been ‘discredited’ in vain.<a id="FNanchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">1524</a> Anthropologists are, however,
becoming convinced that the labour which has been spent
upon calculating the averages of tables of widely different indices
has borne little fruit.<a id="FNanchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">1525</a></p>

<p>When we consider the cranial forms, apart from measurements,
we find the same lack of unanimity. According to Sergi,<a id="FNanchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">1526</a> ‘the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">norma verticalis</i>, or view from above,’ is ‘the most important of all’.
According to Rolleston,<a id="FNanchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">1527</a> ‘the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">norma lateralis</i>, or profile view of
a skull is the most important.’ The present tendency, however, of
British anthropologists is to follow the Italian professor.</p>

<p>The evidence of skulls will often mislead unless it is used with
caution and discernment, reinforced by collateral knowledge. Certain
British brachycephalic skulls of the Bronze Age closely resemble in
many respects those of the Maoris.<a id="FNanchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">1528</a> Rolleston, remarking on the
likeness between a dolichocephalic skull of the Bronze Age from
Weaverthorpe and the famous Engis skull, observes that ‘resemblances
so strong ... should, as they are also so widely scattered
over the globe, make us careful not to speak as to the ethnological
affinities of any skulls, until we have a very considerable number of
representatives of both objects of comparison to place alongside of
each other; and it may be added until we have also succeeded in
bringing other lines of evidence to bear upon the question’.<a id="FNanchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">1529</a></p>

<p>Besides the various characters of the skull and face, and, when
they can be ascertained, the complexion, and the colour of the hair
and eyes, ethnologists have to take account of stature, because,
although it partly depends upon food and social environment,<a id="FNanchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">1530</a> it
unquestionably varies in different races. Now the stature of prehistoric
men, when their skeletons are found, can only be estimated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
by calculating the relations between the lengths of certain bones and
the actual height of the individual; and since these relations are
obviously variable, the calculation can only lead to approximately
true results. The error would no doubt be insignificant if the
average relations were certain; but various anthropologists have
adopted various methods of calculation, which have led to widely
different results.<a id="FNanchor_1531" href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">1531</a> The most satisfactory, for our purpose,<a id="FNanchor_1532" href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">1532</a> appears
to be that of Dr. Beddoe,&mdash;‘I take away from the length of the
femur [or thigh-bone] one-quarter of the excess over 13 inches up
to 19, and thereafter only one-eighth, and then multiply by four’.<a id="FNanchor_1533" href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">1533</a></p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg379">III. EOLITHIC MAN(?)</h3>

<p>Much controversy was excited in the last decade of the nineteenth
century by the announcement that stone implements, ruder than
the rudest of the Palaeolithic Age, had been discovered on the
plateau between the Medway and Caterham valleys: but even if
it were possible to convince sceptics that some of these flints were
wrought by men’s hands, the proof would not affect the present
inquiry; for we should have no means of ascertaining to what race
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
(supposing that it differed from that of the earlier palaeolithic
hunters) those men belonged.<a id="FNanchor_1534" href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">1534</a></p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg380">IV. PALAEOLITHIC MAN</h3>

<p>1. The people who inhabited this island in the Old Stone Age appear
to have been confined to the south; for no palaeolithic implement
has yet been found further north than Lincoln, or, as some maintain,
the East Riding of Yorkshire.<a id="FNanchor_1535" href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">1535</a> An attempt has indeed been
made to prove that such tools were used in Scotland;<a id="FNanchor_1536" href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">1536</a> but the best
judges are unanimously of opinion that the contention has not been
established.<a id="FNanchor_1537" href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">1537</a></p>

<p>Little direct evidence exists as to the physical type of the palaeolithic
inhabitants of Britain. Only four human skulls have been
found in England which can be referred to that period,&mdash;one at
Galley Hill, near Swanscombe,<a id="FNanchor_1538" href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor">1538</a> one at Westley, near Bury St.
Edmunds,<a id="FNanchor_1539" href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor">1539</a> and two in the Cattedown cave near Plymouth:<a id="FNanchor_1540" href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">1540</a> but
it is not certain that the first was contemporaneous with the beds
which contained it:<a id="FNanchor_1541" href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">1541</a> of the second only fragments remained from
which it was impossible to determine the contour;<a id="FNanchor_1542" href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">1542</a> and the others
could not be removed entire. Almost all the older palaeolithic
skulls, however, which have been discovered in Western Europe
belong apparently to the same race,<a id="FNanchor_1543" href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">1543</a> which may have been represented
among the hunters who entered Britain when it still formed
part of the Continent. Indeed the Galley Hill skull, whether it
belonged to a palaeolithic man or not, has certain characteristics
of the most famous representative of the race,&mdash;the Neanderthal
skull, which was discovered about the middle of the last century
in the valley of the Neander in Rhenish Prussia.<a id="FNanchor_1544" href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">1544</a> The skulls of
this type are extraordinarily dolichocephalic; and the people to
whom they belonged had extremely low and retreating foreheads,
heavy and projecting lower jaws, and amazingly prominent brow
ridges, and were short, big-boned, and muscular.<a id="FNanchor_1545" href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">1545</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span></p>

<p>But what if the Neanderthal skull was not human? If that
poor creature had but known how famous he, or it, was to become!
His broken cranium has a bibliography of its own. Virchow, who,
however, late in life changed his mind, at one time regarded it as
abnormal,&mdash;pathological. Huxley and Broca vigorously defended
its respectability; and at the end of the nineteenth century the
most eminent anthropologists of Europe and America accepted it
as the type of the most ancient of the known races of men. But in
1901 a German anthropologist, Dr. G. Schwalbe, wrote an article
of appalling length,<a id="FNanchor_1546" href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">1546</a> which disturbed settled convictions. Huxley
had pronounced the Neanderthal to be the most ape-like of all
known human skulls: Schwalbe refused to regard it as human,
in the accepted sense, at all. For him it represents a distinct
species, intermediate between the <i>Pithecanthropus</i> of Java&mdash;the
famous ‘missing link’, whose remains were discovered a few years
ago by Dr. Dubois&mdash;and man himself. In the same class Schwalbe
places the skulls of Spy, which have always been grouped along with
that of Neanderthal; and he insists that all the human palaeolithic
skulls of Europe, however closely they may appear to resemble
these, are in reality different.<a id="FNanchor_1547" href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor">1547</a> ‘In the Neanderthal skull,’ says
Dr. Laloy, in a lucid summary of Schwalbe’s article, which will
satisfy all who are not specialists, ‘the greatest length coincides
with the “inio-glabellar” diameter,’ that is to say, the diameter
measured from the space between the supraciliary, or brow,
ridges and the sinus at the back of the neck: this, he adds, is
never the case in man. No, not in man as we know him. But
what sense are we to attach to the word ‘human’? Was there
ever a creature of whom it could be affirmed that he was the
first man?<a id="FNanchor_1548" href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">1548</a></p>

<p>Ten or twelve skulls, which, in dolichocephaly and prominence
of the supraciliary ridges, resemble those of the Neanderthal type,
but, unlike them, have high foreheads, and are said to have belonged
to tall men, have lately been found associated with tools of Mousterian
form,<a id="FNanchor_1549" href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">1549</a> at Krapina in Northern Croatia.<a id="FNanchor_1550" href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">1550</a> Fourteen skeletons,
which may evidently be assigned to the same group, have been
found at Předmost in Moravia,<a id="FNanchor_1551" href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">1551</a> and another at its capital, Bruenn.<a id="FNanchor_1552" href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">1552</a></p>

<p>But the Palaeolithic Age, in Britain as in other parts of Europe,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
was of such immense duration that it would be absurd to assume
that it had no other representatives than men of the Neanderthal
type; and the ‘artists’ of the latest period, whose creations have
been discovered in the caves of La Madelaine and Les Eyzies,<a id="FNanchor_1553" href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">1553</a>
belonged to a different race, represented by skulls discovered at
Laugerie-Basse and Chancelade in the valley of the Lozère. While
these skulls are hardly less dolichocephalic than those of the Neanderthal
type, they are in other respects strikingly different, being
much more capacious, and having high and broad foreheads, and
brow ridges which are hardly perceptible.<a id="FNanchor_1554" href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">1554</a> Although no skulls of this
kind have been found in our own country, it is not improbable that
men of the stock to which they belonged penetrated into Britain;
for in one of the caves of Creswell Crags in Derbyshire there has
been found a bone engraved with the figure of a horse’s head,<a id="FNanchor_1555" href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">1555</a>
which reminds one of the spirited designs of the artists of the
Dordogne, and was associated with implements of the kind which
have been found in the caves of La Madelaine and Les Eyzies and
others of the Dordogne basin.<a id="FNanchor_1556" href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">1556</a></p>

<p>The recent systematic exploration of the Baoussé-Roussé caves
near Mentone is of the highest importance because it has demonstrated
an intimate connexion between palaeolithic and neolithic
races in Southern France. All the interments have been proved
to be palaeolithic.<a id="FNanchor_1557" href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">1557</a> The newest skeleton in the Grotte des Enfants
approximates to the dolichocephalic type of the Neolithic Age.<a id="FNanchor_1558" href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">1558</a>
Beneath it, 5 metres 15 millimetres lower down, lay a gigantic
skeleton, closely resembling but far older than that of the famous
‘old man’ of Cro-Magnon, which is commonly assigned to the
earliest neolithic times, but may possibly be as old as the period
that in France is recognized as transitional.<a id="FNanchor_1559" href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">1559</a> This skeleton has
certain negroid characteristics,<a id="FNanchor_1560" href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">1560</a> which, however, are more pronounced
in the two most ancient skeletons of the Grotte des Enfants,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
discovered 70 millimetres lower still and associated with the bones
of a rhinoceros.<a id="FNanchor_1561" href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">1561</a> M. Verneau argues that the prognathism which
appears in certain skeletons of Western Europe of the early Bronze
Age was connected by atavism with these primitive denizens of the
Riviera.<a id="FNanchor_1562" href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">1562</a></p>

<p>2. Professor Boyd Dawkins draws a sharp distinction between
‘the River-drift men’ and ‘the Cave-men’. I must remark that the
term ‘Cave-men’ is not happily chosen; for the professor himself
assures us that ‘the Cave-men did not always use caves’, and that
‘the habit of camping in the open air must have been the rule ...
because caverns and rock-shelters are only met with in very limited
areas’;<a id="FNanchor_1563" href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">1563</a> while on the other hand he points out that ‘River-drift
men’ often lived in caves.<a id="FNanchor_1564" href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">1564</a> By ‘the Cave-men’ he means those
who made implements of what he terms ‘the higher types’, that
is, the types which are called after the caves of Le Moustier, Solutré,
and La Madelaine. Observing that there were ‘Cave-men’ not
only in our own country and in France, but also in Belgium, Switzerland,
and Germany, he argues that ‘from this distribution of the
implements it is evident that the Cave-man belongs neither to the
southern group of the Pleistocene animals nor to the temperate
which found its way over the mountain barriers into Spain, Italy,
and Greece. On the other hand,’ he continues, ‘the River-drift
man must be considered as a member either of the temperate or
southern fauna of Europe, because his remains are met with in
the regions of the Mediterranean, north [and also south] of those
mountain barriers.’<a id="FNanchor_1565" href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor">1565</a></p>

<p>Granting that no implements of the higher types have been
discovered in caves south of the ‘mountain barriers’, it is hardly
safe to conclude that the ‘Cave-men’ did not belong either to the
southern or the temperate group of mammals.<a id="FNanchor_1566" href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">1566</a> The question is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
whether the implements to which the professor refers were characteristic
of one palaeolithic race to the exclusion of others. Assuming
that such implements do not exist outside the area in which they
have been found&mdash;a very rash assumption&mdash;it does not follow that
the men who made them belonged to a race different from their
contemporaries whose tools have been discovered in the drift.
Only one interment of the Late Celtic Period has been found in
Scotland, and that quite recently;<a id="FNanchor_1567" href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor">1567</a> yet there were numerous Celts
then in North as well as in South Britain.</p>

<p>The professor also insists<a id="FNanchor_1568" href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor">1568</a> that ‘the absence of the higher types
of implement in the camping-places of the River-drift men cannot
be accounted for on the ground that they are smaller or ... more
perishable’; for, he says, ‘camping-places of the Cave-men have
been met with in France [for instance at Solutré] ... in which the
implements are associated in the same manner as in the caves’.</p>

<p>I reply, first, that it is begging the question to say that the men
who encamped at Solutré were ‘Cave-men’ as distinct from ‘River-drift
men’; secondly, that implements of Le Moustier type, which
were characteristic of the earliest French ‘Cave-men’,<a id="FNanchor_1569" href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor">1569</a> are common
both in France and Britain in the river-drift;<a id="FNanchor_1570" href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor">1570</a> and thirdly, with
due deference to the professor, that the absence ‘of the higher
types of implement’ from the river-drift is as easily explicable as
the absence of implements of bone or wood:&mdash;partly they were
more perishable and would be more difficult to find, and partly
they were less likely to be used in the field.<a id="FNanchor_1571" href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">1571</a> Besides, is it not
possible that none of the very few palaeolithic ‘camping-places’
that have been found in this country belonged to the Solutrean
period? As we have seen, the professor himself affirms that ‘the
Cave-men’ encamped as a rule not in caves but in the open air:
they, like ‘the River-drift men’ were, as he himself assures us,
hunters: why then have hardly any of their ‘higher types of implement’
been found in this country in the field? Simply for the
reasons which I have given. And since ‘the Cave-men’, like ‘the
River-drift men’, lived commonly in the open air, how could the
latter, even if they belonged to a different race, have escaped the
influence of the former or have failed to acquire their culture?
And how could the two races have escaped amalgamating?</p>

<p>The ‘Cave-men’, as Professor Boyd Dawkins himself admits,<a id="FNanchor_1572" href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">1572</a>
undoubtedly used certain implements of river-drift type as well as
‘the higher types’; nor is there any reason to suppose that the
‘River-drift men’ did not use implements of ‘the higher types’
as well as implements of river-drift type, except the fact, easily
accounted for, that the former are not found in the drift. Professor
Boyd Dawkins himself strenuously maintains that ‘River-drift
men’ as well as ‘Cave-men’ lived in caves.<a id="FNanchor_1573" href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">1573</a> How then can he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
prove that the two sets of occupants were ethnologically different?
He insists that ‘the river-drift implements in the Caves of Creswell
Crags, of Kent’s Hole, and of the Grotte de l’Église, are found in
the strata below those with the implements of the Cave-men, and
consequently that the River-drift men lived in Britain and France
before the Cave-men.’<a id="FNanchor_1574" href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">1574</a> But on his own showing the owners of
both sets of implements did live in caves; and so far nothing is
proved except that those who used one set were more ancient than
those who used the other. ‘Some caves also,’ he adds, ‘were
inhabited by River-drift men, who have left behind their implements
without any trace of the higher types of the Cave-men.’<a id="FNanchor_1575" href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor">1575</a> But here
again nothing is proved save that these particular ‘River-drift
men’ had not yet learned to make ‘the higher types’. The
professor might have a good case if he could say, River-drift implements
have been found in the lower strata of caves: in the upper
strata none have been found, but only ‘the higher types’; consequently
the men who used the higher types were quite different
from those of the later Palaeolithic Age whose implements have
been recovered from river-drift. But this he could not truly say;
for implements of river-drift type have been found, although rarely,
in the highest strata of caves.<a id="FNanchor_1576" href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor">1576</a> Lastly, I would ask the professor,
who insists that ‘the Cave-men’ were ‘northern mammals’, and
that they did not enter Europe until long after the appearance of
‘the River-drift men’, to tell us whence they came.</p>

<p>3. Are we to count the palaeolithic inhabitants of Britain among
our ancestors? ‘I do not consider,’ says Dr. Garson, ‘that there
is any evidence of the existence of the direct descendants of Palaeolithic
man among the osteological remains of Neolithic or subsequent
date in Britain.’<a id="FNanchor_1577" href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">1577</a> On the other hand, Dr. Beddoe<a id="FNanchor_1578" href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">1578</a> thinks that
the oldest inhabitants of this country may have left descendants,
whom he is inclined to identify with ‘some Mongoloid race’, traces
of which, he believes, are discernible in the population of the west
of England; while two distinguished French anthropologists,
MM. de Quatrefages and Hamy, affirm that the Neanderthal race
‘has left a permanent imprint on the population of the three kingdoms’,<a id="FNanchor_1579" href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor">1579</a>
and refer to various skulls of the Neolithic and later periods
which resemble more or less closely that of Neanderthal.<a id="FNanchor_1580" href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor">1580</a> Moreover,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
it is generally admitted that even at the present day a few
individuals here and there belong to the same type.<a id="FNanchor_1581" href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor">1581</a> But it does
not follow that these persons or those to whom Dr. Beddoe and
M. Hamy refer were descended from men who lived in Britain in
the Palaeolithic Age. That palaeolithic man left no descendants in
any part of the world is of course not maintained even by the most
ardent supporters of the theory of the ‘Hiatus’: somewhere or
other there must have been a link; but Sir John Evans, as I have
observed in the first part of this book,<a id="FNanchor_1582" href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor">1582</a> argues from the supposed
absence of intermediate forms of implements that it did not exist
in this country; and Dr. Keane<a id="FNanchor_1583" href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor">1583</a> thinks that ‘the few scattered
palaeolithic hunters could scarcely have lived through the last
ice-age in a contracted region at one time reduced by subsidence
to a mere cluster of islets’, &amp;c. The answer is, first that there is
no reason to believe that in ‘the last ice-age’ or at any time between
the dawn of the latest palaeolithic period and the arrival of neolithic
man Britain was ‘a mere cluster of islets’;<a id="FNanchor_1584" href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor">1584</a> and secondly that,
as Professor Boyd Dawkins assures us, out of forty-eight species of
mammalian fauna living in Britain in the Palaeolithic, thirty-one
survived in the Neolithic Age.<a id="FNanchor_1585" href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor">1585</a> Professor Boyd Dawkins, however,
insists that ‘the mere contrast between the Palaeolithic and wild
Neolithic faunas implies a zoological break of the first magnitude’.<a id="FNanchor_1586" href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor">1586</a>
I take leave to say that it implies no break at all, seeing that thirty-one
of the older species confessedly lived on: it implies no more
than is implied by the disappearance of the urus, the wolf, the wild
boar, and many other animals which were living in this island at
a time since which it has been continuously inhabited by man.
The professor triumphantly points out that in those caves which
were successively used as dwellings by palaeolithic and neolithic
people ‘the remains of the domestic animals are found <i>alone</i> in the
upper Prehistoric [or neolithic] strata.’<a id="FNanchor_1587" href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor">1587</a> Undoubtedly. But what
then? The fact does not prove that palaeolithic man had become
extinct when neolithic man arrived: it merely proves that the
latter had domestic animals, and that the former had not. Arab
horses, Siamese cats, and many other animals have been introduced
into this country since the Christian era: yet the people who were
here before their introduction did not become extinct. And if ‘in
a great many cases the lower Palaeolithic strata [in caves] are
sealed down, and mapped off from the Neolithic, by a layer of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
stalagmite’,<a id="FNanchor_1588" href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor">1588</a> that only proves ‘a break of continuity between the
two periods’ as far as those caves are concerned. The Palaeolithic
Age, says the professor, ‘was continental, the Neolithic insular in
North-Western Europe.’<a id="FNanchor_1589" href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor">1589</a> He means that in the Palaeolithic Age
Great Britain was an outlying part of the Continent, and that the
neolithic invaders had to sail across the Channel.<a id="FNanchor_1590" href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor">1590</a> But why should
the formation of the Channel have extinguished the palaeolithic
race? ‘There is obviously,’ continues the professor, ‘a great
gulf fixed between the rude hunter civilisation of the one and the
agricultural and pastoral civilisation of the other.’ Obviously.
But the gulf is not more obvious than that which separated the
civilization of the Red Indians from the civilization of the Pilgrim
Fathers. Yet the Red Indians still lived on.</p>

<p>It is true that if the professor has failed to show that the Palaeolithic
Age in Britain was abruptly terminated, he has no difficulty in
disposing of certain arguments which have been adduced to show
that it was not. When, for instance, Mr. Allen Brown points to
the implements of palaeolithic type which were found in the refuse
heaps of the neolithic settlement at Cissbury in Sussex, he replies
that ‘in the vast accumulation of refuse, representing every style
in the chipping, from the rough block of flint ... to the highly
finished axe, broken ... by an unhappy blow, it is obvious that
there must be some which would represent well-known Palaeolithic
types.’<a id="FNanchor_1591" href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor">1591</a> Nevertheless it remains true that not one of the facts
which he has stated is inconsistent with the hypothesis that men
may have lived on in Britain in the palaeolithic stage of culture
until the time when the first neolithic immigrants arrived. What
his opponents suggest is that certain types of palaeolithic implements
survived into the Neolithic Age;<a id="FNanchor_1592" href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">1592</a> in other words, that
implements of those types continued to be manufactured or used
then. That this was the case in Ireland is certain;<a id="FNanchor_1593" href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor">1593</a> and, since
there is no evidence of a Palaeolithic Age in Ireland, it seems not
unreasonable to conjecture that they were made by descendants
of palaeolithic refugees from Britain or Gaul. Mr. Allen Brown
may be wrong in maintaining that implements which he has found
‘at or near the surface’ at East Dean in Sussex are ‘mesolithic’,
that is, belong to a period of transition;<a id="FNanchor_1594" href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor">1594</a> but Sir John Evans himself
says<a id="FNanchor_1595" href="#Footnote_1595" class="fnanchor">1595</a> of some of the implements, usually classed as palaeolithic,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
which have been found in the cave earth of the famous Kent’s
Cavern in a position which authorizes us to assume that the people
to whom they belonged were not separated by any ‘hiatus’ from
the palaeolithic race whose remains were found immediately underneath,
that ‘so far as form is concerned, there is little or nothing to
distinguish them from the analogous implements of the Neolithic
Period’. Is it not possible that these and some of the ruder implements
which have hitherto been classed as neolithic may have been
fabricated not by neolithic immigrants but, after their immigration,
by descendants of the palaeolithic race?<a id="FNanchor_1596" href="#Footnote_1596" class="fnanchor">1596</a> Those who deny that
mesolithic implements have been found in Britain deny also that
they have been found anywhere else. Granted for the sake of
argument. But if their general absence does not weaken the certainty
that the supposed hiatus was not universal, how can their
absence in Britain prove that there was a hiatus here? In Part I
I have shown that it is impossible to frame any theory which shall
account satisfactorily for the assumed disappearance of British
palaeolithic man. Professor Boyd Dawkins asks us to believe that
the ‘Cave-men’ fled in terror before the neolithic invaders and
eventually settled in Greenland, where they became the ancestors
of the Eskimos; and in support of this theory he assures us that
‘Palaeolithic man appeared in Europe with the arctic mammalia,
lived in Europe along with them, and disappeared with them’;
that the gloves of the ‘Cave-men’ were ‘similar to those now used
by the Eskimos’; that their implements ‘are of the same kind as
those of the Eskimos’; that, like the Eskimos, they did not take
the trouble to bury their dead; and that ‘the most astonishing
bond of union between the Cave-men and the Eskimos is the art
of representing animals’.<a id="FNanchor_1597" href="#Footnote_1597" class="fnanchor">1597</a> Judging from the specimens of Eskimo
art which the professor gives, I confess that what I find astonishing
is its inferiority to that of the Cave-men;<a id="FNanchor_1598" href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor">1598</a> there is no evidence
that the Cave-men of Britain wore gloves; and if they did, may
not the reason have been, not that there was any connexion between
them and the Eskimos, but that their hands were cold? Is the
professor sure that ‘the River-drift men’ did not also wear gloves?
We do not know whether palaeolithic man appeared in Europe with
the arctic mammalia: he certainly did not accompany them from
the north; and it is an article of faith with French anthropologists
that he did not disappear with them, but became the ancestor of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
neolithic man. There is a general resemblance between the palaeolithic
drift implements of all countries; and in the earlier part of
this volume many facts have been noted which show how cautious
one should be in inferring identity of race from similarity in implements,
weapons, or ornaments. There is not the slightest evidence
that ‘the Cave-men’ did not bury their dead; and there is irrefragable
evidence, as we have seen, that cave-men in the Riviera
and in Croatia did.<a id="FNanchor_1599" href="#Footnote_1599" class="fnanchor">1599</a> Again, since the professor differentiates the
‘Cave-men’ from the ‘River-drift men’ of Britain, can he prove
that the latter did bury their dead? If not, what becomes of his
argument? Finally, the theory that the Eskimos are descendants
of ‘the Cave-men’ of Western Europe has been rejected by every
recent inquirer.<a id="FNanchor_1600" href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor">1600</a></p>

<p>How does Professor Boyd Dawkins account for the disappearance,
which he assumes, of palaeolithic man? ‘Simply,’ he says, ‘by
assuming that at the close of the Pleistocene age, when they came
into contact with Neolithic invaders, there were the same feelings
between them as existed in Hearne’s times between the Eskimos
and the Red Indian, terror and defenceless hatred being, on the
one side, met by ruthless extermination on the other. In this way
the Cave-men would be gradually driven from Europe.’<a id="FNanchor_1601" href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor">1601</a> That
men who were ruthlessly exterminated should have survived to become
the ancestors of the Eskimos is certainly remarkable. But
seriously I would ask the professor whether he has really succeeded
in persuading himself that ‘the Cave-men’ were one and all either
exterminated or driven out of Europe. Did none remain? He
assures us that ‘the Cave-men’ migrated eastward; and he still
insists, in defiance of all French craniologists, that ‘neither of the
two races of Palaeolithic man have left behind any marks in the
existing population of Europe’.<a id="FNanchor_1602" href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor">1602</a> How they contrived to make
their slow progress across the Continent without leaving one descendant
is a problem which he does not attempt to solve. And since he
himself admits, or rather affirms, that they ‘came into contact
with Neolithic invaders’, it is difficult to see how he can maintain
the existence of a hiatus.</p>

<p>The professor has asserted that there is ‘no evidence in any part
of the world of a continuity between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic
ages’.<a id="FNanchor_1603" href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor">1603</a> Yet he of course admits that it must have existed somewhere.
Good reasons have been given for believing that it existed
in France.<a id="FNanchor_1604" href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor">1604</a> Why not also in Britain?<a id="FNanchor_1605" href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor">1605</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span></p>

<p>Such are the reasons by which I endeavour to justify myself in
refusing to believe that neolithic man, when he entered Britain,
found none to welcome or to oppose him save the thirty-one species
of mammalian fauna which Professor Boyd Dawkins has spared.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg390">V. THE PYGMIES (?)</h3>

<p>British pygmies are the creation of Celtic imagination. The
evidence on which we are required to believe that they existed is
this. Professor Rhys<a id="FNanchor_1606" href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor">1606</a> suggests that the name of the Coritani, a
tribe mentioned by Ptolemy,<a id="FNanchor_1607" href="#Footnote_1607" class="fnanchor">1607</a> who inhabited the country between
the Trent and the Nen, is related to the word <i>cor</i>, a dwarf. ‘Then,’
the professor concludes, ‘we should have accordingly to suppose
the old race to have survived so long and in such numbers that
the Celtic lords of Southern Britain called the people of that area
by a name meaning dwarfs.’ Afterwards, referring to various
articles by Mr. David MacRitchie, he observes that in certain parts
of Wales and Scotland there are mounds enclosing cells, which are
‘frequently so small as to prove beyond doubt that those who
inhabited them were of remarkably small stature’;<a id="FNanchor_1608" href="#Footnote_1608" class="fnanchor">1608</a> and he finds
in Welsh, Irish, and Scotch folk-lore traditions which confirm him
in the belief that these cells were inhabited by dwarfs, whom he
calls ‘the Mound Folk’. ‘This strange people,’ he tells us, ‘seems
to have exercised on the Celts ... a sort of permanent spell of mysteriousness
and awe stretching to the verge of adoration ... the
Celt’s faculty of exaggeration, combined with his incapacity to
comprehend the weird and uncanny population of the mounds and
caves ... has enabled him ... to bequeath to the great literatures
of Western Europe a motley train of dwarfs,’<a id="FNanchor_1609" href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor">1609</a> &amp;c. The professor’s
conclusion<a id="FNanchor_1610" href="#Footnote_1610" class="fnanchor">1610</a> is that the earliest people who inhabited these islands
[apparently after the Palaeolithic Age] were ‘the mound folk, consisting
of the short swarthy people variously caricatured by our
fairy tales’; and that they were conquered by neolithic invaders,
who, he tells us, ‘made slaves and drudges of the mound-haunting
race.’</p>

<p>‘These,’ the professor warns us, perhaps superfluously, ‘are conjectures
which I cannot establish; but possibly somebody else may.’</p>

<p>I venture to hint a doubt. Not only is the derivation of <i>Coritani</i>
utterly uncertain,<a id="FNanchor_1611" href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor">1611</a> but it is safe to assume that the Celtic tribe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
who undoubtedly conquered the country which belonged in Ptolemy’s
time to the Coritani would not have called its population, themselves
included, by a name which described not even the people
whom they found in possession, but the ‘slaves and drudges’ of
that people, or rather of their neolithic predecessors! The professor
indeed argued in <i>Celtic Folk-Lore</i><a id="FNanchor_1612" href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor">1612</a> that the Coritanian dwarfs ‘may
be conjectured to have had quiet from invaders from the Continent
because of the inaccessible nature of their fens’. How then did
they themselves and the non-dwarfish invaders of the Bronze Age
get there? It is almost superfluous to remark that in the year
before and in the year after the publication of <i>Celtic Folk-Lore</i> the
professor counted the Coritani among the Brythonic ‘invaders from
the Continent’.<a id="FNanchor_1613" href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor">1613</a> The ‘mound-dwellings’ which Mr. MacRitchie
describes<a id="FNanchor_1614" href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor">1614</a> belong to the class of structures which are popularly
known as ‘Picts’ houses’, ‘Earth-houses’, or ‘Weems’, and are
immeasurably later than the period to which Professor Rhys’s
theory would compel him to assign them. The mere fact, indeed,
that many of them have been shown by excavation to have been
occupied in Roman times does not prove that they were not constructed
earlier; but I can find no evidence that any of them belong
even to the Neolithic Age. Mr. MacRitchie himself assures us
that one which was opened at Crichton in Mid-Lothian ‘was proved
to have been built not earlier than 80 <small>A.D.</small>’;<a id="FNanchor_1615" href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor">1615</a> and he assigns the
‘mound-dwellings’ in general not to a pre-neolithic race but to
the Picts of historic times.<a id="FNanchor_1616" href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor">1616</a> He also says that one which was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
explored in 1855 contained four chambers, of which the largest was
‘6 feet 2 inches long, 4 feet 6 inches in height, and 2 feet 6 inches
wide’, and, with a fascinating lack of humour, he adds that ‘while
the size of the stones used in its construction is evidence of great
personal strength on the part of the builders, the small and narrow
rooms seem to indicate a diminutive race.’<a id="FNanchor_1617" href="#Footnote_1617" class="fnanchor">1617</a> When the reader is
invited to believe that ‘those who inhabited’ these ‘rooms’, which
were only built by the exertion of ‘great personal strength’, ‘were
of remarkably short stature’, he falls to calculating whether even
a race of Tom Thumbs, each of whom possessed the muscular power
of a Sandow, would not have used their strength to make their
rooms a little more comfortable.<a id="FNanchor_1618" href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor">1618</a> Mr. MacRitchie shows more
acumen when, after remarking that ‘two alleged Fairy Knowes in
Shetland’ proved on investigation to be natural hillocks, and that
another in Stirlingshire ‘was only a sepulchral mound’, he concludes
that these instances are ‘sufficient to show the unreliable nature of
popular tradition’.<a id="FNanchor_1619" href="#Footnote_1619" class="fnanchor">1619</a> If it was ‘the Celt’s faculty of exaggeration’
that ‘enabled him to bequeath to the great literatures of Western
Europe a motley train of dwarfs’, why should he not have exercised
his faculty upon the comparatively short neolithic population rather
than upon the imaginary pygmies whom Professor Rhys has appointed
as their ‘slaves and drudges’?<a id="FNanchor_1620" href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor">1620</a> And if the imagination
which created ‘a motley train of dwarfs’ had pygmies for its basis
of fact, will the professor tell us who were the originals of the
‘motley train’ of giants whom the imaginations of various European
peoples associated with the dwarfs?<a id="FNanchor_1621" href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor">1621</a> I am aware that Professor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
Kollmann<a id="FNanchor_1622" href="#Footnote_1622" class="fnanchor">1622</a> claims to have proved that pygmies existed in prehistoric
times in France, Germany, Switzerland, and other European countries;
but the fact remains that no evidence has been produced
that a race of pre-neolithic or even prehistoric pygmies existed in
this country save only that which is furnished by ‘the Celt’s faculty
of exaggeration’.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg393">VI. NEOLITHIC MAN</h3>

<p>The remains of neolithic man have been discovered in caves,
in cairns, in submerged forests, and in barrows in Essex, Wiltshire,
Gloucestershire, Somersetshire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Yorkshire,
Caermarthenshire, Denbighshire, the Isle of Man,<a id="FNanchor_1623" href="#Footnote_1623" class="fnanchor">1623</a> Argyllshire and
the island of Arran, Caithness, and the Orkney Islands.<a id="FNanchor_1624" href="#Footnote_1624" class="fnanchor">1624</a> The
neolithic population, however, it need hardly be said, were scattered
over many other parts of Britain in which their skeletons have not
come to light. Many anthropologists consider that all of them
belong to one race; but at all events the great majority represent
men of medium stature with long skulls; and it is a generally
accepted article of faith that no long barrow has ever yielded any
article of metal in association with a primary interment, and that
no skull whose cephalic index exceeded 79, belonging to a primary
interment, has ever been found in a long barrow since the time
when anthropologists first began to measure skulls in this country.<a id="FNanchor_1625" href="#Footnote_1625" class="fnanchor">1625</a>
According to a table<a id="FNanchor_1626" href="#Footnote_1626" class="fnanchor">1626</a> published by Dr. Beddoe in 1894, the value
of which has been confirmed by later measurements,<a id="FNanchor_1627" href="#Footnote_1627" class="fnanchor">1627</a> the cephalic
indices of 87 skulls belonging to the Neolithic Age ranged from
63 to 79; and, as Dr. Thurnam points out,<a id="FNanchor_1628" href="#Footnote_1628" class="fnanchor">1628</a> some of them are more
dolichocephalic than those of any modern European people.</p>

<p>When we come to examine the stature of the neolithic Britons,
we find that, according to Thurnam’s latest estimate,<a id="FNanchor_1629" href="#Footnote_1629" class="fnanchor">1629</a> the average
height of 25 male skeletons found by him in long barrows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
was 5 feet 5.4 inches,<a id="FNanchor_1630" href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor">1630</a> or 1 metre 661: but Dr. Beddoe gives good
reasons, to which I have already called attention,<a id="FNanchor_1631" href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor">1631</a> for believing
this estimate to be too low; and his own is 5 feet 6.7 inches, or
1 metre 694.<a id="FNanchor_1632" href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor">1632</a> Recent measurements (although they include those
of individuals under 5 feet) do not invalidate the evidence of these
figures;<a id="FNanchor_1633" href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor">1633</a> and the few Scottish skeletons which undoubtedly belong
to the Neolithic Age have yielded practically the same results.<a id="FNanchor_1634" href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor">1634</a></p>

<p>Dr. Garson, describing the dolichocephalic Long Barrow skulls,
with which anthropologists agree in associating those that have been
found in the ‘horned cairns’ of Caithness,<a id="FNanchor_1635" href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor">1635</a> in the neolithic cairns
of the isle of Arran,<a id="FNanchor_1636" href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor">1636</a> and in the caves of Oban,<a id="FNanchor_1637" href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor">1637</a> says that ‘the
superciliary ridges and glabella [the surface between the superciliary
ridges] are moderately or even feebly developed ... the
malar [or cheek] bones are never prominent ... there is no tendency
to prognathism ... as a whole the face is oval in form; the jaws
are small and fine ... the facial characters are mild and without
exaggerated development in any direction’.<a id="FNanchor_1638" href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor">1638</a> It may be added
that the Long Barrow skulls, as Thurnam pointed out, are ‘more or
less depressed&mdash;platycephalic’,<a id="FNanchor_1639" href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor">1639</a> and that the nose is usually aquiline.</p>

<p>The general truth of the foregoing descriptions will be apparent
to any one who examines the plates in <cite>Crania Britannica</cite>; but we
must take account of exceptions. As Dr. Davis pointed out,<a id="FNanchor_1640" href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor">1640</a>
a skull found in the Long Lowe barrow, near Wetton in Staffordshire,
is very different from another dolichocephalic skull from a
chambered long barrow at Uley in Gloucestershire.<a id="FNanchor_1641" href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor">1641</a> In the latter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
the brow ridges are strongly marked, and the chin is comparatively
broad and square.<a id="FNanchor_1642" href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor">1642</a> Of another skull, found in a barrow near
Littleton Drew in North Wiltshire, Thurnam observes that the
lower jaw is ‘thick and heavy’.<a id="FNanchor_1643" href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor">1643</a> A third, taken from a barrow
at West Kennet in North Wiltshire, has an amazingly angular and
square lower jaw, which, as Thurnam truly says, ‘deviates considerably
from the normal type.’<a id="FNanchor_1644" href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor">1644</a></p>

<p>Again, while the average stature of the Long Barrow skeletons
which Thurnam examined was, according to the higher estimate of
Dr. Beddoe, only 5 feet 6·7 inches,<a id="FNanchor_1645" href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor">1645</a> and Rolleston affirmed that he
had ‘never found the stature to exceed 5 feet 6 inches ... in any
skeleton from a barrow which was undoubtedly of the stone and
bone period’,<a id="FNanchor_1646" href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor">1646</a> a skeleton found in the West Kennet barrow had
a thigh bone 20 inches long;<a id="FNanchor_1647" href="#Footnote_1647" class="fnanchor">1647</a> and its possessor would therefore
have stood 6 feet high, or nearly 1 metre 830, on the lowest computation,
and, according to the estimate of Dr. Beddoe, 6 feet 1½ inch
or 1 metre 867. Not less remarkable is a dolichocephalic skeleton
of almost identical dimensions,<a id="FNanchor_1648" href="#Footnote_1648" class="fnanchor">1648</a> described by Dr. Garson, which,
although it was found in a round barrow, undoubtedly belonged to
the Neolithic Age.<a id="FNanchor_1649" href="#Footnote_1649" class="fnanchor">1649</a></p>

<p>It is evident, therefore, that although not one of the people, so
far as we can tell, who buried their dead in long barrows was brachycephalic
in index, yet not only was there a very wide range in their
indices, but some of them were strikingly different, both in form of
skull and feature and in stature, from the normal type. Were
they the result of crossing between individuals of the Long Barrow
race and tall brachycephalic invaders who will be noticed later?
Thurnam himself pointed out that a male skull, whose cephalic
index was 79, found in a primary interment in the long barrow of
Charlton Abbot’s in Wiltshire, was ‘unquestionably brachycephalous’.<a id="FNanchor_1650" href="#Footnote_1650" class="fnanchor">1650</a>
The mere fact that its index was below the conventional
limit did not blind him to its true character.</p>

<p>Let us now see how far those skulls of the Neolithic Age which
have been found in other surroundings resemble the type which is
associated with long barrows.</p>

<p>Putting aside the Scottish skulls which have been already mentioned,
they comprise specimens found in the caves of Perthi-Chwareu
in Denbighshire and Cefn, near St. Asaph; in a chambered
cairn at Tyddyn Bleiddyn, near Cefn; in caves at Rhosdigre
and Llandebie, and at Uphill in Somersetshire;<a id="FNanchor_1651" href="#Footnote_1651" class="fnanchor">1651</a> in the East Ham
Marshes, along with two ‘chipped celts’, fifteen feet below the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
surface;<a id="FNanchor_1652" href="#Footnote_1652" class="fnanchor">1652</a> in the bed of the Trent at Muskham;<a id="FNanchor_1653" href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor">1653</a> and in a submarine
forest, thirty feet below the level of the sea, near the Land’s
End.<a id="FNanchor_1654" href="#Footnote_1654" class="fnanchor">1654</a> Skulls found in tumuli at Keiss in Caithness,<a id="FNanchor_1655" href="#Footnote_1655" class="fnanchor">1655</a> in a tumulus
at Towyn-y-Capel in Anglesey,<a id="FNanchor_1656" href="#Footnote_1656" class="fnanchor">1656</a> and in ‘what seems to be an
alluvial deposit formed by the river Dove’, near Ledbury Hall in
Derbyshire,<a id="FNanchor_1657" href="#Footnote_1657" class="fnanchor">1657</a> may be added doubtfully to the list;<a id="FNanchor_1658" href="#Footnote_1658" class="fnanchor">1658</a> but, as we
shall afterwards see,<a id="FNanchor_1659" href="#Footnote_1659" class="fnanchor">1659</a> there need be no doubt that certain brachycephalic
skulls of the type which is commonly associated with the
round barrows belonged to the Neolithic Age.</p>

<p>Professor Ripley<a id="FNanchor_1660" href="#Footnote_1660" class="fnanchor">1660</a> holds that the Long Barrow people were ‘quite
similar to’ those whose remains have been found in caves, if ‘somewhat
less extreme in physical type’; and Huxley<a id="FNanchor_1661" href="#Footnote_1661" class="fnanchor">1661</a> thought that all
the dolichocephalic and mesaticephalic British skulls of the Neolithic
Age belonged to the same race. Similarly Dr. Garson<a id="FNanchor_1662" href="#Footnote_1662" class="fnanchor">1662</a>
identifies the river-bed type, represented in Britain by the Muskham
skull, with that of the long barrows; while, according to Professor
Boyd Dawkins, the skulls from the Welsh caves and from Tyddyn
Bleiddyn ‘agree in shape ... with some of those given in Tables i.
and ii. of the “Crania Britannica” as “ancient British”’,<a id="FNanchor_1663" href="#Footnote_1663" class="fnanchor">1663</a> and ‘belong
to that type which Professor Huxley terms the river-bed skull’,<a id="FNanchor_1664" href="#Footnote_1664" class="fnanchor">1664</a>
and which, according to him, was identical ‘in general characters’
with the Long Barrow type.<a id="FNanchor_1665" href="#Footnote_1665" class="fnanchor">1665</a> Dr. Beddoe,<a id="FNanchor_1666" href="#Footnote_1666" class="fnanchor">1666</a> on the contrary, says
that both they and the Caithness skulls ‘depart considerably from
the typical long-barrow cranium’, and is inclined to regard them
as belonging to a distinct mesaticephalic race.<a id="FNanchor_1667" href="#Footnote_1667" class="fnanchor">1667</a> The cephalic indices
of the Welsh skulls, which range from 74·3 to 80,<a id="FNanchor_1668" href="#Footnote_1668" class="fnanchor">1668</a> are considerably
higher than those of the Long Barrow skulls in general; and (though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
this may be unimportant) the average height of the men to whom
they belonged was ‘little more than 5 feet’,<a id="FNanchor_1669" href="#Footnote_1669" class="fnanchor">1669</a> or considerably below
the average height of the Long Barrow people. In my opinion
neither they nor the Land’s End skull, which resembles them,<a id="FNanchor_1670" href="#Footnote_1670" class="fnanchor">1670</a> are
pure specimens of the Long Barrow type;<a id="FNanchor_1671" href="#Footnote_1671" class="fnanchor">1671</a> and the same may be
said of the East Ham and Muskham skulls. The one from Towyn-y-Capel,
on the other hand, might be supposed to have come from
a long barrow. The cephalic indices of the Caithness skulls range
from 73 to 78. Four of them<a id="FNanchor_1672" href="#Footnote_1672" class="fnanchor">1672</a> might, I think, pass muster as Long
Barrow skulls; but the remaining two<a id="FNanchor_1673" href="#Footnote_1673" class="fnanchor">1673</a> appear to me different. Of
the Ledbury skull, the cephalic index of which is 77, Huxley himself
says that ‘a little flattening and elongation, with a rather greater
development of the supraciliary ridges would convert this into the
nearest likeness to the Neanderthal skull which has yet been
discovered’.<a id="FNanchor_1674" href="#Footnote_1674" class="fnanchor">1674</a> It may be that there was some infusion of the blood
of the Long Barrow race in all the people to whom these skulls
belonged; but I have little doubt that if, with the few exceptions
which I have noted, they were placed on a table among those of the
long barrows, a skilled craniologist could pick out every one of
them. The difference is easily accounted for when it is remembered
that the long barrows were almost certainly erected late in the
Neolithic Age,<a id="FNanchor_1675" href="#Footnote_1675" class="fnanchor">1675</a> and that there were neolithic men in Scotland when
the estuary of the Forth extended 8 or 10 miles west of Stirling,
and when the sea relatively to the west coast was 25 feet higher
than it is now.<a id="FNanchor_1676" href="#Footnote_1676" class="fnanchor">1676</a></p>

<p>A female skull, belonging apparently to the Neolithic Age, was
discovered about the year 1891 ‘on the Batten promontory, near
Plymouth Sound’.<a id="FNanchor_1677" href="#Footnote_1677" class="fnanchor">1677</a> According to the report of the discovery, it
‘approaches dolichocephaly’. A photograph of this skull<a id="FNanchor_1678" href="#Footnote_1678" class="fnanchor">1678</a> reminded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
me of some of the illustrations of round skulls in <cite>Crania
Britannica</cite>. To quote from the report,<a id="FNanchor_1679" href="#Footnote_1679" class="fnanchor">1679</a> ‘the most striking features
of the face are the great size of the orbits, the strongly marked
superciliary ridge, the lowness of the retreating forehead’; and
all these features are characteristic of some of the most typical
Bronze Age skulls.</p>

<p>A few years ago Professor Macalister said that he had not recognized
any skulls of the Long Barrow type in Ireland,<a id="FNanchor_1680" href="#Footnote_1680" class="fnanchor">1680</a> where no
such barrows exist; but several specimens have since been found.<a id="FNanchor_1681" href="#Footnote_1681" class="fnanchor">1681</a></p>

<p>There is, as we have seen, reason to believe that the neolithic
population of Britain were not homogeneous; but, with the qualifications
that have been already noted, it may be truly said that
the people of the long barrows present a uniform type. Whence
did they come, and what were their affinities? The view which
may be said to hold the field, although it is not universally accepted,<a id="FNanchor_1682" href="#Footnote_1682" class="fnanchor">1682</a>
is that they belonged to the so-called ‘Iberian’ race. Before we
discuss this theory, it may be well to warn the reader that among
those who hold it are writers who have absolutely no knowledge of
‘the Iberian question’ except on the side of physical anthropology.
The word ‘Iberian’, as used by ethnologists, is not always confined
to the Iberians of history, that is, the inhabitants of the Spanish
peninsula and of Southern Gaul between the Pyrenees and the
Rhône:<a id="FNanchor_1683" href="#Footnote_1683" class="fnanchor">1683</a> it is often loosely applied to a people, possessing certain
common physical features, who inhabited various parts of the
Mediterranean basin, and, according to some writers, notably
Sergi,<a id="FNanchor_1684" href="#Footnote_1684" class="fnanchor">1684</a> penetrated in late quaternary and neolithic times into almost
every country of Europe. And when it is applied by ethnologists
to the Iberians of history, it is not applied to all of them, for
the Iberians of history were of course a mixed people: the
ethnologists are thinking only of those Iberians who belonged to
the dolichocephalic Mediterranean stock.</p>

<p>The arguments which have been brought forward in favour of
the theory that the Long Barrow race belonged to the Iberian
branch of the Mediterranean stock may be summarized as follows:&mdash;
First, according to Tacitus,<a id="FNanchor_1685" href="#Footnote_1685" class="fnanchor">1685</a> the Silures, a British tribe which in
his time inhabited what is now Monmouthshire, Glamorganshire,
and Herefordshire, were dark and had curly hair, from which fact,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
as well as from their geographical position, he inferred that Iberians,
that is inhabitants of the Spanish peninsula, had migrated into
Britain.<a id="FNanchor_1686" href="#Footnote_1686" class="fnanchor">1686</a> But if the dolichocephalic Iberians were dark, so were
the brachycephalic people who settled in Gaul in the Neolithic Age:
Tacitus’s geographical argument was based upon the notion, prevalent
among the ancient geographers,<a id="FNanchor_1687" href="#Footnote_1687" class="fnanchor">1687</a> that Spain was ‘opposite’
and near Britain; and it is of course incredible that people should
have sailed in the Neolithic Age from Spain to our island.</p>

<p>Secondly, much stress has been laid upon the alleged resemblance
of the Long Barrow skulls to those of the Basques, the assumption
being that the latter were Iberians, properly so called. Dr. Garson
affirms that there is ‘a strong similarity between Basque skulls
and those of the Neolithic people of Britain’;<a id="FNanchor_1688" href="#Footnote_1688" class="fnanchor">1688</a> while Thurnam<a id="FNanchor_1689" href="#Footnote_1689" class="fnanchor">1689</a>
points out that the skulls of the Basques are very ‘similar in many
respects to the skulls from chambered long barrows of South-West
Britain’, and that the Long Barrow skulls in general closely resemble
‘sixty Basque skulls lately added to the collection of the
Anthropological Society of Paris’.<a id="FNanchor_1690" href="#Footnote_1690" class="fnanchor">1690</a> Moreover, Dr. Beddoe<a id="FNanchor_1691" href="#Footnote_1691" class="fnanchor">1691</a> says,
‘Many photographs of Basques ... are recognized, both by myself
and by an observant Welsh anthropologist to whom I have submitted
them, as being in no respect different from some of the
ordinary types of feature in South Wales.’</p>

<p>Now, as I have shown elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_1692" href="#Footnote_1692" class="fnanchor">1692</a> the investigations which have
been made regarding the cranial characters of the Basques have
led to widely different results; and Dr. Garson does not say to
what group of Basque skulls he refers. Both the Spanish and the
French Basques, according to Dr. Collignon,<a id="FNanchor_1693" href="#Footnote_1693" class="fnanchor">1693</a> differ in certain respects
from all other European peoples; but they also differ from each
other, the former being generally dolichocephalic, while the latter
are (according to Broca’s notation)<a id="FNanchor_1694" href="#Footnote_1694" class="fnanchor">1694</a> sub-brachycephalic, and their
cranial capacity is considerably less than that of their Spanish
brethren. Dr. Collignon is inclined to assimilate the Basques
generally to the Kabyle type.<a id="FNanchor_1695" href="#Footnote_1695" class="fnanchor">1695</a> Assuming that the Long Barrow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
race resembled the Spanish Basques in certain respects, the resemblance
only tends to show that the ancestors of the Long Barrow
race came from the south. The ancestors, or rather some of the
ancestors of the Basques were undoubtedly Iberians,&mdash;in one sense
of the word: but the French Basque type which Dr. Collignon has
described, and which he regards as original,<a id="FNanchor_1696" href="#Footnote_1696" class="fnanchor">1696</a> is in many respects
different from that of the long barrows, which ethnologists call
Iberian; and, as I have shown elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_1697" href="#Footnote_1697" class="fnanchor">1697</a> the purest French
Basques are generally fair, the Spanish Basques are less dark than
other Spaniards, and the Long Barrow race were undoubtedly
dark. Moreover, many ethnologists overlook the fact that the
language of the so-called Iberian inscriptions, which have been
found scattered over the territory that belonged to the Iberians,
cannot be interpreted by the aid of Basque,<a id="FNanchor_1698" href="#Footnote_1698" class="fnanchor">1698</a> and shows no trace
of kinship with Basque.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Sergi, affirming that the Long Barrow people belonged
to the Iberian branch of the stock which he has taught ethnologists
to call Mediterranean, says,<a id="FNanchor_1699" href="#Footnote_1699" class="fnanchor">1699</a> ‘I have compared the forms of the
skulls from British graves with ancient.... Mediterranean skulls,
and have found those characteristic of Spain, of Portugal ... of
Greece, of Hissarlik, and of East Africa.’ The fact is undeniable;
but obviously it does not tend to prove that the Long Barrow race
belonged to the Iberian rather than to the Ligurian branch, which,
according to Sergi,<a id="FNanchor_1700" href="#Footnote_1700" class="fnanchor">1700</a> ‘extends from the Iberian peninsula as far as
Italy,’ or to any other branch of the Mediterranean stock. Moreover,
when Sergi affirms<a id="FNanchor_1701" href="#Footnote_1701" class="fnanchor">1701</a> that ‘wherever the Mediterranean stock
established itself, it preserved its primitive burial custom of inhumation’,
and that ‘incineration was of absolutely Aryan [that
is to say, on his theory, Asiatic] origin’,<a id="FNanchor_1702" href="#Footnote_1702" class="fnanchor">1702</a> he weakens his argument,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
for it is certain that incineration was practised by many of the Long
Barrow people.<a id="FNanchor_1703" href="#Footnote_1703" class="fnanchor">1703</a> Furthermore, Sergi tells us that skeletons of
‘the Mediterranean type’ are characterized by ‘slender and delicate
forms’,<a id="FNanchor_1704" href="#Footnote_1704" class="fnanchor">1704</a> and doubtless most of the skeletons which have been
found in long barrows answer to this description; but thirteen
skeletons found in a chambered long barrow at Rodmarton, Gloucestershire,
were distinguished by ‘powerful and vigorous frames’.<a id="FNanchor_1705" href="#Footnote_1705" class="fnanchor">1705</a></p>

<p>I conclude that there is not sufficient evidence for referring the
Long Barrow people to the Iberian rather than to some other branch
of the Mediterranean stock.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that the Long Barrow race closely resembled
in cranial characteristics, and to a lesser degree in stature,
the dolichocephalic neolithic population of Gaul, of whom the people
whose remains have been discovered in the caverns of l’Homme
Mort<a id="FNanchor_1706" href="#Footnote_1706" class="fnanchor">1706</a> and Baumes-Chaudes<a id="FNanchor_1707" href="#Footnote_1707" class="fnanchor">1707</a> were perhaps the most typical representatives;
and this resemblance confirms the truth of the theory
that the Long Barrow people were a branch of the ‘Mediterranean’
stock. But one argument, upon which Thurnam<a id="FNanchor_1708" href="#Footnote_1708" class="fnanchor">1708</a> laid great stress,
should warn us to be cautious in drawing conclusions from the
skeletal characters of prehistoric peoples of whose other characters
we are necessarily ignorant. About the middle of the nineteenth
century several skeletons were discovered in a neolithic barrow at
Fontenay, near Caen. Their skulls resembled those of the long
barrows; and the height of the tallest, according to Thurnam’s
system of measurement, would not have exceeded 5 feet 1 inch, or
1 metre 550. This, he triumphantly remarks, confirms the opinion
that the peoples who erected the sepulchral chambers at Fontenay
and in the south-west of England belonged to the same race. But
the average height of the Long Barrow people, according to Thurnam,
was 5 feet 5·4 inches,<a id="FNanchor_1709" href="#Footnote_1709" class="fnanchor">1709</a> and the average height of the brachycephalic
Round Barrow people 5 feet 8·4 inches.<a id="FNanchor_1710" href="#Footnote_1710" class="fnanchor">1710</a> This difference of 3 inches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
is one of the facts upon which he relies to prove the distinction&mdash;a
distinction which is of course as certain as it is universally admitted&mdash;between
the Long Barrow people and the brachycephalic
Round Barrow people. Yet he regards the difference of 4.4 inches
between the average height of the Long Barrow people and the
tallest of the men who were buried at Fontenay as sufficient to prove
the racial identity of the latter with the former!</p>

<p>Dr. Keane<a id="FNanchor_1711" href="#Footnote_1711" class="fnanchor">1711</a> maintains that the route followed by the people
who introduced the neolithic culture into the British Isles is indicated
by the dolmens which abound in many parts of Northern
Africa, and are scattered along the western side of the Spanish
peninsula and over nearly the whole area of France. This is also
the opinion of Professor Flinders Petrie, who affirms that ‘the
dolmens belong to one continuous series, passing from Syria, along
North Africa, and up Spain to Western Europe’,<a id="FNanchor_1712" href="#Footnote_1712" class="fnanchor">1712</a> of Montelius,<a id="FNanchor_1713" href="#Footnote_1713" class="fnanchor">1713</a>
Sophus Müller,<a id="FNanchor_1714" href="#Footnote_1714" class="fnanchor">1714</a> and Sergi.<a id="FNanchor_1715" href="#Footnote_1715" class="fnanchor">1715</a> Penka, on the other hand (I quote
from Mr. J. L. Myres’s exposition of his views), ‘reads the series
the other way,’ because ‘while on the north these monuments
go back into the Stone Age, in France and the south they belong
to the Bronze Age’. He observes that ‘the discovery of dolmens
in North Africa and Syria ... has proceeded <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari passu</i> with the
discovery both of actual survival of a tall blond dolichocephalic
race in the same areas, and of evidence in Egyptian portraiture
of its wider extension in the second millennium <small>B.C.</small>’ He maintains
therefore that the earliest dolmen-builders were dolichocephalic
blonds, speaking an Aryan language, in Southern Scandinavia
and Denmark.<a id="FNanchor_1716" href="#Footnote_1716" class="fnanchor">1716</a></p>

<p>Now the ethnological problem presented by the distribution of
the dolmens is exceedingly difficult; and it is not certain that either
of the above-mentioned views is right. Dolmens are found not
only in the countries which have been already mentioned, but also
in Japan, India, Persia, Arabia, Syria, Palestine, Moab, Asia Minor,
the Crimea, the Netherlands, Northern Germany, and the Balearic
Islands;<a id="FNanchor_1717" href="#Footnote_1717" class="fnanchor">1717</a> and it is possible that in certain other countries their
non-existence may be due simply to lack of the necessary stones.<a id="FNanchor_1718" href="#Footnote_1718" class="fnanchor">1718</a>
In the territory which corresponds with ancient Gaul there are no
dolmens east of the line formed by the Jura and the Vosges;<a id="FNanchor_1719" href="#Footnote_1719" class="fnanchor">1719</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
while the departments in which they are most numerous form
a band extending obliquely from Finistère to Gard, that is, from
the Channel to the Mediterranean.<a id="FNanchor_1720" href="#Footnote_1720" class="fnanchor">1720</a> The single department of the
Morbihan contains more megalithic monuments, including menhirs,
or single standing stones, than all the other departments put together;
but in the list of dolmens it ranks below Aveyron and
Ardèche.<a id="FNanchor_1721" href="#Footnote_1721" class="fnanchor">1721</a> In the Spanish peninsula almost all the dolmens are
concentrated in Portugal, the north-eastern corner of Spain, and
the southern and eastern seaboard: in Southern Britain they are
found in Cornwall, Devonshire, Dorsetshire, Somersetshire, Wiltshire,
Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Kent, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and Northumberland,
in Monmouthshire,<a id="FNanchor_1722" href="#Footnote_1722" class="fnanchor">1722</a> Herefordshire, and Wales;<a id="FNanchor_1723" href="#Footnote_1723" class="fnanchor">1723</a> while in
Scotland they are represented by the horned cairns of Caithness
and the chambered cairns of Orkney, Inverness, Argyllshire, Arran,
and other islands.<a id="FNanchor_1724" href="#Footnote_1724" class="fnanchor">1724</a> In Ireland they are everywhere, but most
numerous in the west.<a id="FNanchor_1725" href="#Footnote_1725" class="fnanchor">1725</a></p>

<p>There is a striking resemblance, which, in certain cases, amounts
to almost complete identity of form, between many of the dolmens
of Western Europe and some even of the Caucasus and India;
although, as might have been expected, local peculiarities exist
everywhere.<a id="FNanchor_1726" href="#Footnote_1726" class="fnanchor">1726</a> Thus the chambered long barrow of West Kennet
in Wiltshire is identical in construction with the Hünebedden, or
‘Giants’ Graves’, of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, and Hanover;<a id="FNanchor_1727" href="#Footnote_1727" class="fnanchor">1727</a>
and close resemblances have been noted between certain dolmens
in Wales and others in Brittany and Portugal,<a id="FNanchor_1728" href="#Footnote_1728" class="fnanchor">1728</a> between some in
Antrim and others in Denmark,<a id="FNanchor_1729" href="#Footnote_1729" class="fnanchor">1729</a> and between certain Irish dolmens
and the peculiar ship-shaped monuments of the Balearic Isles.<a id="FNanchor_1730" href="#Footnote_1730" class="fnanchor">1730</a>
It is of course true that in sepulchres of such rude and simple construction
general resemblance is inevitable, and does not necessarily
imply community of origin: but when we find that in the Caucasus,
in Syria and India, and in every European country in which dolmens
exist some few have one of their stones pierced with a hole;<a id="FNanchor_1731" href="#Footnote_1731" class="fnanchor">1731</a> that
the covering-stones of certain dolmens in Portugal, Ireland, Cornwall,
Sweden, and elsewhere are indented with small circular depressions,<a id="FNanchor_1732" href="#Footnote_1732" class="fnanchor">1732</a>
and that the sepulchral customs discernible in the dolmens
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
of widely separated countries are virtually identical,<a id="FNanchor_1733" href="#Footnote_1733" class="fnanchor">1733</a> it must
be admitted that there is ground for the opinion that the custom
of dolmen-building originated with some one people.<a id="FNanchor_1734" href="#Footnote_1734" class="fnanchor">1734</a> On the
other hand, it is easily conceivable that these coincidences originated
in customs and beliefs which may have been common property
before the first dolmen was set up, or which may have been handed
on at a later time from tribe to tribe. De Mortillet argued that
dolmens were not the exclusive creation of any one race because
in France skeletons of widely different races have been found within
them.<a id="FNanchor_1735" href="#Footnote_1735" class="fnanchor">1735</a> But this fact only proves that an intruding race buried
their dead in dolmens built by others, or else adopted the custom of
dolmen-building from their predecessors. It has also been argued
that the differences in detail which are noticeable in the dolmens of
the various countries of Western Europe prove that they were not
the work of one migratory people but of various settled tribes;
and that this conclusion is borne out by the similarity between the
culture of the dolmen-builders of widely separated countries such
as France and Denmark.<a id="FNanchor_1736" href="#Footnote_1736" class="fnanchor">1736</a> What is certain is that if the dolmens
had been erected successively by peoples who migrated westward
from Syria or even North Africa, and whose descendants moved on
northward to the British Isles, we should expect to find that the
British dolmens belonged to a period very much later than those
of the Mediterranean. But the oldest dolmens of North Africa
are assigned by General Faidherbe to the very end of the Neolithic
and the commencement of the Bronze Age.<a id="FNanchor_1737" href="#Footnote_1737" class="fnanchor">1737</a> The arguments of
Penka, whatever value they may have in regard to the origin of
dolmen-building, certainly do not prove that the Long Barrow
race were descended from Scandinavian ancestors: for their skulls
are easily distinguishable from those of Scandinavia;<a id="FNanchor_1738" href="#Footnote_1738" class="fnanchor">1738</a> the neolithic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
pottery of Britain is utterly different from that of the north;<a id="FNanchor_1739" href="#Footnote_1739" class="fnanchor">1739</a> and
the distribution of the dolmens in the British Isles, where they are
most numerous in Western Britain and in Ireland, is hardly consistent
with the theory that the people who erected them came
from the north-east. Moreover, the remains which have been
found in the oldest Scandinavian dolmens indicate that the culture
which they represent was more advanced than that which is manifested
in similar tombs in Gaul or the British Isles.<a id="FNanchor_1740" href="#Footnote_1740" class="fnanchor">1740</a></p>

<p>On the question of the origin of dolmens I offer no opinion. But
in regard to those of Western Europe the least improbable theory
appears to be that which was first tentatively propounded by M.
Cazalis de Fondonce,<a id="FNanchor_1741" href="#Footnote_1741" class="fnanchor">1741</a> and developed by Mr. Borlase,<a id="FNanchor_1742" href="#Footnote_1742" class="fnanchor">1742</a> namely, that
a dolichocephalic people who were erecting dolmens in France and
the Spanish peninsula, where these monuments may have been
evolved from sepulchral caves,<a id="FNanchor_1743" href="#Footnote_1743" class="fnanchor">1743</a> were forced westward by the brachycephalic
‘Grenelle’ race who invaded those countries in the Neolithic
Age;<a id="FNanchor_1744" href="#Footnote_1744" class="fnanchor">1744</a> that some of them migrated into the British Isles,
and others into Holland and Northern Germany,<a id="FNanchor_1745" href="#Footnote_1745" class="fnanchor">1745</a> whence the
custom of dolmen-building would have spread to Denmark and
Scandinavia; and that others [perhaps] moved southward into
Africa. The earlier neolithic dolmen-builders of Gaul, like the
Long Barrow people of Britain, belonged to the ‘Mediterranean’
type; and on the theory which I have stated their ancestors might
have migrated into Spain and Gaul from Africa long before the first
African dolmen was erected.</p>

<p>Lastly, linguistic arguments have been adduced to prove the
African origin of the Long Barrow race.<a id="FNanchor_1746" href="#Footnote_1746" class="fnanchor">1746</a> Professor Morris Jones<a id="FNanchor_1747" href="#Footnote_1747" class="fnanchor">1747</a>
endeavours to show that the Celtic language was modified, after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
it had been introduced into Britain, by the language or languages
which it encountered;<a id="FNanchor_1748" href="#Footnote_1748" class="fnanchor">1748</a> and he claims to have established the
syntactical similarity of the modern Celtic dialects to Egyptian
and to the Hamitic dialects generally, and to have demonstrated
that ‘neo-Celtic syntax agrees with Hamitic in almost every point
where it differs from Aryan’.<a id="FNanchor_1749" href="#Footnote_1749" class="fnanchor">1749</a> This, he concludes, is ‘the linguistic
complement of the anthropological evidence, and the strongest
corroboration of the theory of the kinship of the early inhabitants
of Britain to the North African white race’.</p>

<p>I would not, however, venture to commit myself to the theory
of Sergi, that the cradle of the ‘Iberian’ race, or of the ‘Mediterranean’
race of which it was an offshoot, was in Northern Africa
or Somaliland.<a id="FNanchor_1750" href="#Footnote_1750" class="fnanchor">1750</a> Professor Boyd Dawkins infers ‘from their range
as far north as Scotland, and at least as far to the east as Belgium,
that they travelled by the same paths that the Celtic, Belgic, and
Germanic tribes travelled ... coming from the East, and pushing
their way to the West; and that another [group] mastered Northern
Africa’; and he argues that this view ‘is confirmed by the examination
of the domestic animals which they possessed. The short-horned
ox, the sheep, and the goat, are derived from wild stocks
that are now to be found only in Central Asia.... None of these
animals were known in Europe before the Neolithic Age.’<a id="FNanchor_1751" href="#Footnote_1751" class="fnanchor">1751</a> But
any one who has read so far will have seen that the range of the
‘Iberian’ race ‘as far north as Scotland’ lends no support to the
theory that it originated in Asia. In regard to the argument which
the professor derives from the examination of the domestic animals,
Rolleston<a id="FNanchor_1752" href="#Footnote_1752" class="fnanchor">1752</a> inclined to the view that ‘though coming in the ultimate
resort from the east, [they] ... did not reach the north of the Alps
directly from the East, but only ... from the Greek and Italian
peninsulas’. But the truth is that we do not know whether the
<i>earliest</i> neolithic invaders of the British Isles or of Western Europe
possessed short-horned oxen, sheep, or goats.<a id="FNanchor_1753" href="#Footnote_1753" class="fnanchor">1753</a> Supposing that
these animals came from the East, is it not possible that they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
introduced into Europe not by the ‘Mediterranean’ race but by
brachycephalic neolithic immigrants? Moreover, Professor Boyd
Dawkins has himself admitted that ‘the common domestic hog,
descended from the wild boar, may have been originally tamed in
Europe’,<a id="FNanchor_1754" href="#Footnote_1754" class="fnanchor">1754</a> and that the vegetables possessed by the Swiss lake-dwellers
may have been ‘derived from Southern Europe’;<a id="FNanchor_1755" href="#Footnote_1755" class="fnanchor">1755</a> and
it is now generally held that the domestic animals of the neolithic
inhabitants of Europe were of European origin, and that there
is no evidence that their plants and cereals were derived from
Asia.<a id="FNanchor_1756" href="#Footnote_1756" class="fnanchor">1756</a></p>

<p>On the whole the evidence shows that the neolithic inhabitants
of Britain, or at all events a large proportion of them, were descended
from ancestors who lived in the Mediterranean basin. But it does not
follow that they were more intimately related to the people whom
the ancient writers called Iberians than to some other branch of
the Mediterranean stock. It is certain that before the Romans
entered the Spanish peninsula two languages at least besides Celtic
were spoken there,&mdash;Basque and the language of the so-called
Iberian inscriptions.<a id="FNanchor_1757" href="#Footnote_1757" class="fnanchor">1757</a> The latter has not yet been deciphered:
but, as we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_1758" href="#Footnote_1758" class="fnanchor">1758</a> all attempts to explain it by means of Basque
have failed; and, as Professor Morris Jones admits, all attempts
to discover traces of Basque influence in the Celtic dialects have
been equally unsuccessful.<a id="FNanchor_1759" href="#Footnote_1759" class="fnanchor">1759</a></p>

<p>Therefore it should be distinctly understood that if the term
‘Iberian’ is to be applied to the neolithic inhabitants of Britain,
it must be taken in a purely conventional sense.<a id="FNanchor_1760" href="#Footnote_1760" class="fnanchor">1760</a></p>

<p>M. d’Arbois de Jubainville<a id="FNanchor_1761" href="#Footnote_1761" class="fnanchor">1761</a> adduces various British place-names,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
for example, <i>Sabrina</i> (the Severn), Isca (the Exe), <i>Albion</i>, and
<i>Cantium</i> (Kent), which he chooses to call Ligurian; but I am not
aware that he has made any converts. Little or nothing is known
about the Ligurian tongue;<a id="FNanchor_1762" href="#Footnote_1762" class="fnanchor">1762</a> and even if M. d’Arbois’s conjectures
could be verified their ethnological value would be comparatively
slight; for, as I have shown elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_1763" href="#Footnote_1763" class="fnanchor">1763</a> there is some reason to
believe that the Ligurians, like the Iberians, belonged to the ‘Mediterranean’
stock.</p>

<p>It is perhaps hardly necessary now to insist upon the fact that
the Long Barrow race is not extinct. Not only have their remains
been found, as we shall presently see, in graves of the Bronze Age
and the Late Celtic period,<a id="FNanchor_1764" href="#Footnote_1764" class="fnanchor">1764</a> but men of the same type, but little
modified, are still numerous.<a id="FNanchor_1765" href="#Footnote_1765" class="fnanchor">1765</a></p>

<p>It is often taken for granted that no round barrows were erected
in Britain before the close of the Neolithic Age, and that the earliest
of the brachycephalic invaders whose remains have been found in
them landed with bronze weapons in their hands.<a id="FNanchor_1766" href="#Footnote_1766" class="fnanchor">1766</a> But these
assumptions are made in spite of conclusive evidence. There is
not the slightest doubt that most if not all of the circular chambered
cairns of Argyllshire, Caithness, Orkney, and Derbyshire were
erected before the Bronze Age in those parts began.<a id="FNanchor_1767" href="#Footnote_1767" class="fnanchor">1767</a> Dr. Garson,
speaking of brachycephalic skulls which have been found in round
barrows in Orkney, says that ‘the fact that no metals of any kind
were found, and that all the implements were of the most primitive
manufacture, points to the people belonging to the unpolished
stone period’, and concludes that ‘we probably post-date the
existence of the people who buried in the round barrows of Orkney
if we attribute them with (<i>sic</i>) the same antiquity as those of the
round barrows of England’.<a id="FNanchor_1768" href="#Footnote_1768" class="fnanchor">1768</a> Dr. Garson has also shown that the
round barrow of Howe Hill in Yorkshire was erected in the Neolithic
Age, and that the skeletons found in it belong to the Long
Barrow type.<a id="FNanchor_1769" href="#Footnote_1769" class="fnanchor">1769</a> The round-headed people who introduced drinking-cups
into our island brought no bronze with them. According to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
Barnard Davis, a skull from a chambered round barrow at Parsley
Hay Low in Derbyshire, which had a cephalic index of 81, ‘without
doubt belongs to the early “stone-period”’;<a id="FNanchor_1770" href="#Footnote_1770" class="fnanchor">1770</a> and he assigns to
the same epoch another skull, the cephalic index of which was the
same, from Green Gate Hill barrow, Pickering, Yorkshire.<a id="FNanchor_1771" href="#Footnote_1771" class="fnanchor">1771</a> Canon
Greenwell suggests that some of the round barrows ‘belong to an
age before bronze was discovered’; and it is certain that the round
barrows of this country were connected by evolution with the
earlier long barrows.<a id="FNanchor_1772" href="#Footnote_1772" class="fnanchor">1772</a> Finally, if Sergi<a id="FNanchor_1773" href="#Footnote_1773" class="fnanchor">1773</a> is right in maintaining
that ‘the new burial custom of cremation’ was introduced into
Europe by brachycephalic immigrants, it follows that they invaded
Britain in the Neolithic Age; for in this country, as in Gaul, cremation
was then practised.<a id="FNanchor_1774" href="#Footnote_1774" class="fnanchor">1774</a></p>

<h3 id="PII_CVII">VII. THE ‘PICTISH QUESTION’</h3>

<p>A view which has become fashionable of late years, owing to the
influence of Professor Rhys and Professor Zimmer, is that the
[dolichocephalic] neolithic people of this country were identical with
the Picts,<a id="FNanchor_1775" href="#Footnote_1775" class="fnanchor">1775</a> whose name first occurs in the panegyric addressed about
<small>A.D.</small> 296 to Constantius Caesar.<a id="FNanchor_1776" href="#Footnote_1776" class="fnanchor">1776</a> To clear the ground, I should
say, first, that it is universally admitted that descendants of the
neolithic race survived not only in the part of Scotland which was
inhabited by the Picts but in most parts of Britain. The question
is whether the Picts represented that race in a special sense, and
still spoke the neolithic non-Aryan language. As we shall see,
Professor Rhys himself, who maintains that they did, emphatically
affirms that among the medley of tribes who were known as Picts
some were Celtic and spoke a Celtic tongue. Secondly, it may be
well to state certain elementary facts of Celtic phonology (although
I dare say that to most of those who may read these pages they
are already familiar), without a knowledge of which parts of the
following discussion and of the later section on the Celts would be
unintelligible. The ancient Gauls, for the most part,<a id="FNanchor_1777" href="#Footnote_1777" class="fnanchor">1777</a> and the
Brythons, from whose dialect modern Welsh is descended, are
commonly called the P Celts; while the Goidels, whose dialect was
the ancestor of Gaelic, Irish, and Manx, are known as the Q Celts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
The reason of this distinction is that the Gauls and Brythons changed
the original sound <i>qu</i> into <i>p</i>, while the Goidels retained it, and in
the sixth century of our era modified it into <i>c</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1778" href="#Footnote_1778" class="fnanchor">1778</a> It has been affirmed,
however, on the evidence of the formularies of Marcellus of Bordeaux,
that some of the Western Gauls in the fourth century spoke a dialect
which was akin to Goidelic;<a id="FNanchor_1779" href="#Footnote_1779" class="fnanchor">1779</a> and Professor Rhys and Mr. Nicholson<a id="FNanchor_1780" href="#Footnote_1780" class="fnanchor">1780</a>
regard the words <i>Sequani</i> and <i>Sequana</i> (the Gallic name of the
Seine) as proving that this dialect was not confined to the west:
but M. d’Arbois de Jubainville refuses to admit that these names
are Celtic,<a id="FNanchor_1781" href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor">1781</a> and contemptuously denies that the formularies are to
be taken seriously.<a id="FNanchor_1782" href="#Footnote_1782" class="fnanchor">1782</a> Professor Rhys<a id="FNanchor_1783" href="#Footnote_1783" class="fnanchor">1783</a> and Mr. Nicholson<a id="FNanchor_1784" href="#Footnote_1784" class="fnanchor">1784</a> also
infer from certain inscriptions found in the departments of the Ain
and Deux-Sèvres, which probably belong respectively to the first
and the fourth century of our era, that a dialect akin to Goidelic
was spoken in those localities: but here again M. d’Arbois dissents;<a id="FNanchor_1785" href="#Footnote_1785" class="fnanchor">1785</a>
and he remarks that an inscription found at Géligneux in the department
of the Ain contains a word, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">petru-decametos</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1786" href="#Footnote_1786" class="fnanchor">1786</a> which belongs to
the language of the P Celts. Professor Rhys urges that ‘the presence
of monuments in the language occupying the subordinate position
may be taken as evidence presumptive of its being the vernacular
in the immediate neighbourhood’:<a id="FNanchor_1787" href="#Footnote_1787" class="fnanchor">1787</a> but, as we shall see hereafter,<a id="FNanchor_1788" href="#Footnote_1788" class="fnanchor">1788</a>
a pillar, bearing a Goidelic inscription, has been found at Silchester,
where the vernacular was undoubtedly Brythonic; and the obvious
explanation is that the inscription was the work of a stranger.
M. d’Arbois,<a id="FNanchor_1789" href="#Footnote_1789" class="fnanchor">1789</a> moreover, unlike Professor Rhys, maintains that when
the Celts first invaded Britain, the Celtic language everywhere was
one and the same: according to him, none of the Celts had then
changed <i>q</i> into <i>p</i>, but that change was made at a later date by the
Celts who conquered Gaul, and some of whose descendants afterwards
conquered Britain. Until near the end of the nineteenth
century Celtic scholars unanimously believed that all the Celtic
dialects had rejected ‘Indo-European <i>p</i>’, except, as Mr. Nicholson
says,<a id="FNanchor_1790" href="#Footnote_1790" class="fnanchor">1790</a> ‘in borrowed words or in certain combinations of consonants’;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
in other words, that wherever the Indo-European or Aryan tongue
from which Celtic was descended had the sound of <i>p</i> the Celtic
dialects had all lost it: but Professor Rhys holds that Mr. Nicholson
has proved from the above-mentioned inscriptions, found in the
departments of the Ain and Deux Sèvres, that it was retained by
the Sequani and the Pictones.<a id="FNanchor_1791" href="#Footnote_1791" class="fnanchor">1791</a> M. d’Arbois de Jubainville of course
rejects this conclusion; and he reminds his opponents that <i>p</i> is
absent from all Ogam inscriptions.<a id="FNanchor_1792" href="#Footnote_1792" class="fnanchor">1792</a></p>

<p>1. In 296, when the panegyric addressed to Constantius was written,
the Picts to whom the writer referred were confined to the part of
Scotland which extends northward from the firths of Forth and
Clyde; but Professor Rhys and Professor Zimmer maintain that
the habitat of the Pictish people was once much more extensive.
‘Irish literature,’ says Professor Rhys,<a id="FNanchor_1793" href="#Footnote_1793" class="fnanchor">1793</a> ‘alludes to Picts here and
there in Ireland ... in such a way as to favour the belief that they
were survivals of a race holding possession at one time of the whole
country.’ That the Picts once inhabited the whole of Britain is
proved, in the opinion not only of the two professors but also of
M. d’Arbois de Jubainville, who differs from them on the question
of Pictish ethnology, by the following linguistic facts.<a id="FNanchor_1794" href="#Footnote_1794" class="fnanchor">1794</a> The Irish
name of the Picts was <i>Cruthni</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1795" href="#Footnote_1795" class="fnanchor">1795</a> Britain has, since the Middle
Ages, been called in Welsh <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">ynys Prydein</i>: <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Prydein</i> is the Welsh
equivalent of <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Cruthni</i>; and <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">ynys Prydein</i> means ‘the island of the
Picts’. Now, as Professor Rhys remarks,<a id="FNanchor_1796" href="#Footnote_1796" class="fnanchor">1796</a> <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Prydein</i>, with its cognate
forms, <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Prydain</i>, <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Prydyn</i>, and <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Pryden</i>, represents an old Welsh word
<i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Priten</i>; and accordingly, the Brythonic or the Gaulish name of the
Picts, when it reached the ears of the Greeks, would have been
written by them Πρετανοί. It must of course be borne in mind that
<i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">Cruthni</i>, <i>Prydain</i>, and <i>Priten</i> did not appear in literature until long
after Caesar’s time; but the etymology which connects Πρετανοί and
Πρεταν(ν)ικαὶ (νῆσοι)&mdash;the name by which Ptolemy and other Greek
writers call the British Isles<a id="FNanchor_1797" href="#Footnote_1797" class="fnanchor">1797</a>&mdash;with <i>Priten</i> is accepted by Celtic
scholars who, on the question of the ethnology of the Picts, differ
widely among themselves. M. d’Arbois de Jubainville<a id="FNanchor_1798" href="#Footnote_1798" class="fnanchor">1798</a> concludes
that in the time of Pytheas the masters of Britain were the Picts;
while Professor Rhys holds that when, shortly before that epoch,
the Brythons first landed in Britain,<a id="FNanchor_1799" href="#Footnote_1799" class="fnanchor">1799</a> not the Picts but the Goidelic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
Celts were the dominant race. In other words, he believes that
the Goidelic Celts called the island which they conquered by ‘some
such a Goidelic name as Inis Chruithni, “Island of the Picts”’.<a id="FNanchor_1800" href="#Footnote_1800" class="fnanchor">1800</a>
M. d’Arbois identifies the Picts of the time of Pytheas with the
ancestors of the Goidelic Celts: like Professor Rhys he regards the
word <i>Pretani</i> as simply the Brythonic, or Gaulish form of a Goidelic
word <i>Qrtanoi</i>, of which <i>Cruthni</i> was the later Irish equivalent;<a id="FNanchor_1801" href="#Footnote_1801" class="fnanchor">1801</a>
but he holds that no Brythons had set foot in Britain until after
the time of Pytheas, and that the word <i>Pretani</i> was learned by
Pytheas not in Britain but in Gaul.</p>

<p>Both the views that have just been stated seem to involve difficulties.
If Professor Rhys is right in believing that the pre-Roman
Goidelic invaders of Britain (whose very existence, as we shall
afterwards see, is not universally admitted) called the people whom
they found in possession by some such name as Chruithni or Cruthni,
the name which, transformed by Brythons into <i>Pretanoi</i>, was applied
by Pytheas to the inhabitants of Britain generally, it would appear
either that the Goidelic invaders had no name of their own or that
it was suppressed.<a id="FNanchor_1802" href="#Footnote_1802" class="fnanchor">1802</a> Moreover, Professor Rhys does not explain
how it happened that Pytheas never learned the name by which,
as he tells us, the Brythons called themselves, namely, Brittones.
On the other hand, M. d’Arbois’s view would compel us either to
assign the first Brythonic invasion to a date a century later than
that which is now generally accepted,<a id="FNanchor_1803" href="#Footnote_1803" class="fnanchor">1803</a> or to assume that Pytheas,
although he visited Britain, learned nothing there of the name of
its inhabitants. I confess that I cannot suggest any satisfactory
solution.</p>

<p>It remains to be inquired whether the Picts of history did really,
in a special sense, represent the neolithic population, and whether
they spoke a non-Aryan language.</p>

<p>2. Was the word <i>Pict</i>, in its original form, pre-Aryan or Celtic?
The answers that have been given to this question only serve to
amuse the ignorant scoffer, and to illustrate the truth that even if
the labours of Zeuss placed the study of the ancient Celtic languages
upon a scientific basis, Celtic scholars still know very little about
them. When we inquire of Professor Rhys, we are perplexed by
the quick changes of front to which his most devoted disciples have
by this time become accustomed. In the second edition of his
<i>Celtic Britain</i><a id="FNanchor_1804" href="#Footnote_1804" class="fnanchor">1804</a> he said that ‘neither the Picts nor the Scotti probably
owned these names, the former of which is to be traced to Roman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
authors’; and he described the theory which ‘connected the Pict
with the Gaulish Pictones’ as a ‘clumsy invention’.<a id="FNanchor_1805" href="#Footnote_1805" class="fnanchor">1805</a> In his Rhind
Lectures he assured us that ‘the principal non-Aryan name of the
inhabitants of both islands [Great Britain and Ireland] was some
prototype of the word Pict’,<a id="FNanchor_1806" href="#Footnote_1806" class="fnanchor">1806</a> and gave reasons, which are now
generally accepted, for believing that that name was not connected
with the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pictus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1807" href="#Footnote_1807" class="fnanchor">1807</a> At the same time he definitely committed
himself to the view which he had previously derided as a ‘clumsy
invention’, and affirmed that ‘the word Pict ... is hardly to be
severed from the Pictones of ancient Gaul’. In <cite>The Welsh People</cite>,
which first appeared in 1900, and in a later edition of the same
work, dated 1902,<a id="FNanchor_1808" href="#Footnote_1808" class="fnanchor">1808</a> he argued that ‘<i>Ictis</i> [the name of an island
mentioned by Diodorus Siculus<a id="FNanchor_1809" href="#Footnote_1809" class="fnanchor">1809</a>] and <i>Icht</i> [the old Irish name of
the English Channel] represent possibly a Celtic pronunciation of
the same Aboriginal word which the Romans made into <i>Pictus</i>
... we must’, he added, ‘suppose it an early name which the
Aborigines adopted, while the Celts ... applied another name
<i>Qṷrtani</i>, <i>Pretani</i>, <i>Cruithni</i>,’ &amp;c. But in the same year in which
the first edition of <cite>The Welsh People</cite> appeared he told the members
of the British Association that ‘<i>pictos</i> was a Celtican word of the
same etymology, and approximately, doubtless, of the same meaning
as the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pictus</i>; that the Celticans had applied it at an early
date to the Picts on account of their ... tattooing themselves; and
that the Picts had accepted it’.<a id="FNanchor_1810" href="#Footnote_1810" class="fnanchor">1810</a> It is not absolutely clear whether
by ‘the Celticans’ he means only those people of Gaul who spoke
a language akin to Goidelic or the first Celtic invaders of Britain.
As, however, we are told that the Picts accepted their name from
‘the Celticans’, it would seem that those ‘Celticans’ were, or at
all events included, the British Goidels; and we ask ourselves in
bewilderment why, if the ‘Celticans’ applied the name <i>pictos</i> to
the Picts, they also applied the name <i>Qṷrtani</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1811" href="#Footnote_1811" class="fnanchor">1811</a> But when we
open the latest edition of <cite>Celtic Britain</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_1812" href="#Footnote_1812" class="fnanchor">1812</a> we find that the professor’s
views are still in process of development, or of flux. He now reverts
to the theory that ‘the native name which suggested the Latin
[<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pictus</i>] was not of Celtic origin either, though only found treated
as Celtic’. He adds that ‘the term Pictones, as occurring in Gaul
in Caesar’s time, makes it probable that it was also a name of long
standing in Britain’; and finally he avows with characteristic
candour that ‘we know not from what language it comes’. Turning
to our other authorities, we learn from Zimmer that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picti</i> is obviously
a Latin translation of the name [the ancestor of <i>Prydain</i>] which the
Romans learned from the Britons.<a id="FNanchor_1813" href="#Footnote_1813" class="fnanchor">1813</a> In other words, the German
<i>savant</i> holds that the word Pictos [if it ever existed except as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
Latin accusative plural] was neither aboriginal in Britain, nor
Celtican. It has been suggested<a id="FNanchor_1814" href="#Footnote_1814" class="fnanchor">1814</a> that <i>Picti</i> is connected with the
old Irish word <i>cicht</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1815" href="#Footnote_1815" class="fnanchor">1815</a> a carver or engraver, and is the Cymric form
of a Goidelic word <i>Qicti</i>;<a id="FNanchor_1816" href="#Footnote_1816" class="fnanchor">1816</a> while Mr. Nicholson, who insists that
<i>Picti</i> is not Cymric but Goidelic, claims to have ‘fully shown that
this name is ... from the root <i>peik-</i> “tattoo”, with Ind.-Eur. <i>p</i>
preserved’.<a id="FNanchor_1817" href="#Footnote_1817" class="fnanchor">1817</a></p>

<p>The one absolutely certain conclusion to which the student of
ethnology can come is that the name of the Picts has not been
proved to be of pre-Aryan origin.</p>

<p>3. Still, Professors Rhys and Zimmer will have it that the Picts
must have been a non-Aryan people. Caesar,<a id="FNanchor_1818" href="#Footnote_1818" class="fnanchor">1818</a> in a well-known
passage, states that among the Britons groups of ten or twelve
men had wives in common; in other words, that one of the British
customs was polyandry. It has generally been assumed that he
meant to say that the custom was prevalent among the Britons
generally; but Zimmer, after reviewing the whole chapter in which
the passage occurs, concludes that it refers only to <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">interiores</i>&mdash;the
Britons of the interior<a id="FNanchor_1819" href="#Footnote_1819" class="fnanchor">1819</a>&mdash;whom Caesar contrasts with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maritimi</i>,&mdash;the
descendants of the Belgic invaders. The latter, he argues,
according to Caesar’s express statement, differed but slightly in
their customs from the Gauls:<a id="FNanchor_1820" href="#Footnote_1820" class="fnanchor">1820</a> therefore the words in which Caesar
describes the British custom of polyandry cannot refer to them,
but must refer to <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">interiores</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1821" href="#Footnote_1821" class="fnanchor">1821</a> The two professors agree in thinking
that Caesar, owing to his ‘inability to realize a state of society
exclusively based on birth’,<a id="FNanchor_1822" href="#Footnote_1822" class="fnanchor">1822</a> misunderstood the institution which
he tried to describe; in other words, that that institution was not
polyandry but matriarchy,&mdash;the rule of succession by which rank
and property are transmitted in the female line; a king, for example,
being succeeded not by his own son but by the son of one of his
sisters.<a id="FNanchor_1823" href="#Footnote_1823" class="fnanchor">1823</a> Zimmer, referring to Schrader’s <cite>Prehistoric Antiquities of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
the Aryan Peoples</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_1824" href="#Footnote_1824" class="fnanchor">1824</a> remarks that among all Aryan-speaking peoples
and among the primitive Aryans the custom by which a father is
succeeded by his own son (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">das Vaterrecht</i>) was the foundation of
social ordinance.<a id="FNanchor_1825" href="#Footnote_1825" class="fnanchor">1825</a> Professor Rhys,<a id="FNanchor_1826" href="#Footnote_1826" class="fnanchor">1826</a> indeed, thinks that this generalization
cannot be proved, and refers to a well-known passage in the
20th chapter of the <cite>Germania</cite> of Tacitus,&mdash;‘Sisters’ sons are held
in as much esteem by their uncles as by their fathers: indeed,
some regard the relation as even more sacred and binding’,<a id="FNanchor_1827" href="#Footnote_1827" class="fnanchor">1827</a> &amp;c.
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sororum filiis idem apud avunculum qui apud patrem honor: quidam
sanctiorem artioremque hunc nexum sanguinis arbitrantur</i>); but he
suggests that the tribe of which Tacitus speaks may have been
mixed with some ‘aboriginal race practising the same institution
as the aborigines of the British Isles’. And I suggest that the
Picts were Celts mixed with aborigines who practised this same
institution, and consequently that if it prevailed among the Picts,
its prevalence does not prove that they were in any special sense
representatives of the aborigines, or that they spoke a non-Aryan
language.<a id="FNanchor_1828" href="#Footnote_1828" class="fnanchor">1828</a></p>

<p>Having corrected Caesar’s narrative to his own satisfaction,
Professor Rhys sets himself to prove that matriarchy was a Pictish
institution. He observes<a id="FNanchor_1829" href="#Footnote_1829" class="fnanchor">1829</a> that ‘a Pictish king [during the later
period of the Roman occupation and afterwards] could not be
succeeded by a son of his own, but usually by a sister’s son. The
succession,’ he continues, ‘was through the mother, and it points
back to a state of society which, previous to the conversion of the
Picts to Christianity, was probably based on matriarchy as distinguished
from marriage and marital custom.’ To show that
matriarchy had formerly prevailed in Britain outside the territory
within which the Picts of history were confined, he adds<a id="FNanchor_1830" href="#Footnote_1830" class="fnanchor">1830</a> that ‘the
ancient literature of Ireland abounds in allusions to heroes who
are usually described with the aid of the mother’s name’, and that
‘this kind of nomenclature implies the Pictish succession as its
origin’. Again, he quotes an inscription found at Colchester,
which ends with the words</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">DONVM. LOSSIO. VEDA. DE SVO</span>
<span class="i0">POSVIT. NEPOS. VEPOGENI. CALEDO.</span>
</div></div>

<p>(‘This gift has been dedicated at his own expense by Lossio Veda,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
the son of the sister [?] of Vepogen, a Caledonian’), and remarks
that when Lossio calls himself a Caledonian, that ‘is for our purpose
much the same as if he had called himself a Pict’, and that, moreover,
both <i>Veda</i> and <i>Vepogeni</i> ‘may be said to occur in the list of
Pictish kings’, where the latter is ‘written <i>Vipoig</i>’. <i>Vepogeni</i>,
indeed, is a Celtic word, borrowed, the professor assures us, in
accordance with Pictish custom; but ‘the reduction of Vepogen
to <i>Vepog</i>, which is what underlies <i>Vipoig</i>, is impossible on Celtic
ground ... while Pictish offers a simple and natural explanation’.<a id="FNanchor_1831" href="#Footnote_1831" class="fnanchor">1831</a></p>

<p>Professor Morris Jones remarks, in support of Professor Rhys’s
argument, that ‘the Pictish succession’ has ‘come down to our
own times among the Berbers’<a id="FNanchor_1832" href="#Footnote_1832" class="fnanchor">1832</a> (or rather Kabyles), who, he says,
have been shown, on craniological grounds, to be akin to our neolithic
race.</p>

<p>Apparently Professor Rhys does not regard the custom of reckoning
descent ‘by birth alone’ as confined in these islands to the
Picts, or to the pre-Aryan aborigines: if, as he is inclined, like
Professor Zimmer, to believe, it was non-Aryan, ‘it must,’ he says,
‘have been accepted by the Goidelic Celts from the aborigines.’<a id="FNanchor_1833" href="#Footnote_1833" class="fnanchor">1833</a></p>

<p>Now, in regard to this last observation, the comment suggests
itself that what Professor Rhys has not yet proved is that those
aborigines were Picts. The Picts, as we shall presently see, were,
according to some Celtic scholars, themselves Goidelic Celts (mixed
of course with aborigines whom they had subdued and Celticized);
according to others, their speech was akin to Brythonic.<a id="FNanchor_1834" href="#Footnote_1834" class="fnanchor">1834</a> And if,
as Professor Rhys insists, matriarchy may have been accepted by
the Celts from the aborigines, it is perhaps not incredible that, as
Mr. Sidney Hartland suggests, the Celts themselves, in prehistoric
times, may have passed through the matriarchal stage,<a id="FNanchor_1835" href="#Footnote_1835" class="fnanchor">1835</a> and that
the survival of matriarchy among the Picts is not necessarily attributable
to pre-Aryan ancestry.<a id="FNanchor_1836" href="#Footnote_1836" class="fnanchor">1836</a> But, be that as it may, the survival
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
of matriarchy among the Picts proves nothing more than
that among the Picts, as among every other British people, the
substratum of the population was pre-Aryan: it does not prove
that the dominant element among them was pre-Aryan, or that they
spoke a non-Aryan language.</p>

<p>As for Professor Morris Jones’s argument, it may perhaps raise
a probability that the ‘Pictish succession’ prevailed among the
neolithic race, although, if the argument is worth anything, the
professor ought to be able to show that the same institution belonged
to the ‘Iberians’ of Spain, of Gaul, and of other countries
who have also been shown ‘on craniological grounds’ to be akin
to the Kabyles: but at all events it lends no support to the theory
that the Picts were, in any special sense, descendants of the neolithic
aborigines; for, assuming that they were Celts, they might have
accepted the Pictish succession from them. There remains Professor
Rhys’s statement that ‘the reduction of <i>Vepogen</i> to <i>Vepog</i>, which is
what underlies <i>Vipoig</i>, is impossible on Celtic ground’. Is the
professor quite sure? A few years ago he would certainly have
said that the retention of ‘Indo-European <i>p</i>’ was ‘impossible on
Celtic ground’; but in 1900 he announced that the ‘Celtican
language’ which was spoken in the country of the Sequani ‘preserves
intact the Aryan consonant <i>p</i>’.<a id="FNanchor_1837" href="#Footnote_1837" class="fnanchor">1837</a> He has himself assured
us that both the Celtic dialects spoken in the British Isles were
greatly modified by a pre-Aryan language.<a id="FNanchor_1838" href="#Footnote_1838" class="fnanchor">1838</a> Assuming, for the
sake of argument, that the Pictish language was Celtic, is he prepared
to deny that it could have been so far modified by a non-Aryan
tongue that ‘the reduction of <i>Vepogen</i> to <i>Vepog</i>’ would still have
been ‘impossible on Celtic ground’?<a id="FNanchor_1839" href="#Footnote_1839" class="fnanchor">1839</a> Finally, when he tells us
that Lossio’s description of himself as a Caledonian ‘is for our
purpose much the same as if he had called himself a Pict’, we cannot
help recalling his own statement<a id="FNanchor_1840" href="#Footnote_1840" class="fnanchor">1840</a> that ‘the Caledonians were, as
we understand their history, Goidels’; though, to be sure, in the
latest edition of <cite>Celtic Britain</cite><a id="FNanchor_1841" href="#Footnote_1841" class="fnanchor">1841</a> he expunges this compromising
sentence, and substitutes for it ‘the Caledonians were Picts’.</p>

<p>For my part I accept the professor’s emendation unreservedly.
Picts the Caledonians certainly were; for does not the author of
the panegyric addressed to Constantine speak of ‘the Caledonians
and other Picts’?<a id="FNanchor_1842" href="#Footnote_1842" class="fnanchor">1842</a> But for me the Picts were a mixed people,
comprising descendants of the neolithic aborigines, of the Round
Barrow race, and of the Celtic invaders,&mdash;a mixed people who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
spoke a Celtic dialect. And what puzzles me is that the professor
should not have been struck by the anthropological facts that are
fatal to the theory that the Caledonians were Picts in the sense
which he attaches to the word,&mdash;that is, pure survivors of the neolithic
aborigines, who spoke a non-Aryan language. For the neolithic
aborigines, as we have seen, were, speaking generally, small
dark men of the ‘Iberian’ type: the Caledonians were big fair
or red-haired men. Doubtless there were, as I have said, ‘Iberian’
survivors among them; but who will deny that the powerful race
whom Tacitus describes were predominant, or that their Aryan
tongue had prevailed?<a id="FNanchor_1843" href="#Footnote_1843" class="fnanchor">1843</a></p>

<p>4. It is usually inferred from statements in Claudian<a id="FNanchor_1844" href="#Footnote_1844" class="fnanchor">1844</a> and
Herodian<a id="FNanchor_1845" href="#Footnote_1845" class="fnanchor">1845</a> that the Picts tattooed themselves; and their testimony
is supposed to be strengthened by the etymology of the names
by which the Picts were known to the Irish and Welsh respectively,&mdash;<i>Cruthni</i>
and <i>Prydain</i>. The former is said to be derived from <i>cruth</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1846" href="#Footnote_1846" class="fnanchor">1846</a>
the Gaelic word for ‘form’ or ‘shape’; and the latter from its
Welsh equivalent, <i>pryd</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1847" href="#Footnote_1847" class="fnanchor">1847</a> Thus <i>Cruthni</i> and <i>Prydain</i> would mean
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
‘the people whose bodies were decorated with figures’; and, as
we have seen, Zimmer has no doubt that the Roman name for the
Picts&mdash;<i>Picti</i>, or ‘painted men’&mdash;was simply a translation of <i>Prydain</i>
or its older equivalent. Professor Rhys, who, in one of his many
and diverse utterances on the subject, affirmed that <i>pictos</i> was
a Celtican word,<a id="FNanchor_1848" href="#Footnote_1848" class="fnanchor">1848</a> drew this conclusion from the fact, pointed out by
Mr. Nicholson,<a id="FNanchor_1849" href="#Footnote_1849" class="fnanchor">1849</a> that a coin of the Gallic tribe of the Pictones<a id="FNanchor_1850" href="#Footnote_1850" class="fnanchor">1850</a>
bears on the obverse a tattooed face; and he supposes that the
reason why the Celticans applied this word to the Picts was that
the latter tattooed themselves. ‘The Picts of Britain and Ireland,’
he remarks, ‘are found also called <i>Pictones</i>’; and ‘ancient Egyptian
monuments represent the Libyans of North Africa with their bodies
tattooed’.<a id="FNanchor_1851" href="#Footnote_1851" class="fnanchor">1851</a></p>

<p>Now what does this community of custom prove about the
ethnology of the Picts? The inhabitants of the Tonga and Society
Islands and of New Guinea tattoo themselves: so do the Burmese,
the Shans, the Maoris, and the people of British East Africa;<a id="FNanchor_1852" href="#Footnote_1852" class="fnanchor">1852</a> so
do very many Englishmen. All the available evidence tends to show
that among the ancient inhabitants of the British Isles tattooing
was not confined to the Picts. Herodian does not mention the
Picts at all: he merely says that the Britons tattooed themselves.
Professor Rhys admits, or rather strenuously maintains, that in the
territory inhabited by the Picts in Scotland there were also numerous
Celts;<a id="FNanchor_1853" href="#Footnote_1853" class="fnanchor">1853</a> and he would hardly deny that they were included
among the people whom Herodian describes. He himself remarks
that ‘the Scotti (that is to say the Goidels)’<a id="FNanchor_1854" href="#Footnote_1854" class="fnanchor">1854</a> practised tattooing.<a id="FNanchor_1855" href="#Footnote_1855" class="fnanchor">1855</a>
Mr. Nicholson, to whom he appeals, argues from the evidence of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
coins that tattooing was customary not only among the Pictones,
but also among several other tribes of Gaul,&mdash;the Ambiani, the
Baiocasses, the Caletes, the Coriosopites, the Osismi, the Sequani,
and the Unelli. All these peoples were undoubtedly Celtic; that
is to say, they were Celtic-speaking tribes among whom the Celtic
element, ethnologically speaking, was, I do not say numerically,
but politically predominant. Professor Rhys would certainly not
argue that they were Picts: yet if he admits, as he does, that they
were Celtic, the argument which he bases on the practice of tattooing
collapses.</p>

<p>5. Some years ago Professor Rhys attempted to prove that the
Pictish language was related to Basque;<a id="FNanchor_1856" href="#Footnote_1856" class="fnanchor">1856</a> ‘but,’ he says, ‘whether
it is related or not, my attempt to prove that it is has been pronounced,
and doubtless justly pronounced, a failure.’<a id="FNanchor_1857" href="#Footnote_1857" class="fnanchor">1857</a> At the
same time, however, pointing to a famous ogam inscription, he
wrote, ‘my challenge still remains, that if Pictish resembled Gaelic or
Welsh, or in fact any Aryan language, those who think so should
make good their opinion by giving us a translation of such an inscription,
for instance, as the following from Lunasting, in Shetland:&mdash;<i>Xttocuhetts :
ahehhttmnnn : hccvvevv : nehhtonn</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_1858" href="#Footnote_1858" class="fnanchor">1858</a></p>

<p>The lay reader will perhaps mentally endorse the comment of
another Celtic scholar, Dr. Alexander Macbain, who disposes of the
cacophonous puzzle by observing that ‘it is neither Welsh nor any
other language’.<a id="FNanchor_1859" href="#Footnote_1859" class="fnanchor">1859</a> For the present, at all events, it is safe to say
that Dr. Macbain is as likely to be right as Mr. Nicholson, who,
having boldly accepted Professor Rhys’s challenge, first judiciously
reconstructed the text of the inscription, and then made an heroic
attempt to translate his own version. It is Goidelic, so he assures
us; and it means</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Place of O’ Cuhetts</span>
<span class="i1">his place within:</span>
<span class="i1"><small>CUAIBH</small> of Nehton’.<a id="FNanchor_1860" href="#Footnote_1860" class="fnanchor">1860</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the other hand, the translation which Professor Rhys
‘provisionally’ offers of <i>his</i> text runs</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘“Kin&mdash;Ahehhtmnnn King Nechtan”.</span>
</div></div>

<p>That is to say, King Nechtan of the kin of Ahehhtmnnn’.<a id="FNanchor_1861" href="#Footnote_1861" class="fnanchor">1861</a></p>

<p>Perhaps it shows a slight lack of humour to attempt, even ‘provisionally’,
to translate an inscription assumed to be written in
a language the very existence of which is doubtful. Still it is conceivable
that Professor Rhys’s text means what he says. But,
supposing that it resembles neither Gaelic, nor Welsh, nor any
Aryan language, what does it prove? Not that the Picts represented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
the neolithic aborigines, but simply that in the remotest of
the British isles there still survived the non-Aryan language which,
as every scholar admits, was once spoken in Britain.</p>

<p>But the truth is that the so-called Pictish inscriptions, even in the
hands of the philologist, are so intractable that for ethnology they
are practically useless. ‘I can hardly do more,’ says Professor
Rhys,<a id="FNanchor_1862" href="#Footnote_1862" class="fnanchor">1862</a> ‘than pick from previous attempts by others and by myself
what seems to me the most probable reading.’ This is only one
of numerous instances in his well-known article on the inscriptions
which show how impossible it is to construct the text with any
approach towards certainty.</p>

<p>Professor Rhys remarks, further,<a id="FNanchor_1863" href="#Footnote_1863" class="fnanchor">1863</a> that ‘we have indications in
Adamnan’s Life of Columba that [in the sixth century of our era]
the language of the aborigines was still a living tongue’. The
indications are that when Columba, who spoke Goidelic, visited
the province of the Picts, he preached ‘to peasants or plebeians
by interpreter’. To those who hold, with Dr. Whitley Stokes and
Dr. Macbain, that the Pictish dialect was akin to Brythonic, the fact
on which Professor Rhys lays stress presents of course no difficulty.
M. d’Arbois de Jubainville, however, while he agrees with Dr.
Macbain,<a id="FNanchor_1864" href="#Footnote_1864" class="fnanchor">1864</a> makes a reply to Professor Rhys which might be used
by those who hold, with Mr. Nicholson, that Pictish was akin to
Goidelic. He tells a story of a Breton priest of the diocese of
Quimper who assured him that he himself could not understand the
Breton dialect of a woman who belonged to the diocese of Vannes.<a id="FNanchor_1865" href="#Footnote_1865" class="fnanchor">1865</a></p>

<p>Mr. Nicholson<a id="FNanchor_1866" href="#Footnote_1866" class="fnanchor">1866</a> says that ‘we have abundant materials for
deciding whether Pictish was or was not (1) Aryan, (2) Keltic,
(3) Goidelic, in (<i>a</i>) the place-names recorded by ancient geographers
and one or two mediaeval documents, (<i>b</i>) the person-names
given by one or two ancient historians and in mediaeval
chronicles, (<i>c</i>) the inscriptions’. From these materials Mr. Nicholson
undertakes to demonstrate that Pictish was Goidelic, and that
‘it stands to Highland Gaelic in exactly the same relation in which
Anglo-Saxon stands to modern English’;<a id="FNanchor_1867" href="#Footnote_1867" class="fnanchor">1867</a> while Dr. Whitley
Stokes<a id="FNanchor_1868" href="#Footnote_1868" class="fnanchor">1868</a> and Dr. Macbain<a id="FNanchor_1869" href="#Footnote_1869" class="fnanchor">1869</a> undertake with equal confidence to
demonstrate that it was related to Brythonic. According to Bede,<a id="FNanchor_1870" href="#Footnote_1870" class="fnanchor">1870</a>
the place which marked the western termination of the wall of
Severus was called in Pictish <i>Peanfahel</i>. <i>Pean</i> is commonly identified
with the Welsh word <i>penn</i>, ‘a head’; and accordingly it has
been inferred that Pictish was ‘a Kymric or semi-Kymric dialect’.<a id="FNanchor_1871" href="#Footnote_1871" class="fnanchor">1871</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
Mr. Nicholson, on the other hand, claims to have shown that <i>Pean</i>
is ‘a Goidelic borrowing from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">penna</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pinna</i>’. Professor
Rhys<a id="FNanchor_1872" href="#Footnote_1872" class="fnanchor">1872</a> formerly clung to the view that <i>Peanfahel</i> was a Brythonic
name, but was not in the least disconcerted thereby; for, he explained,
‘the Picts must have learnt it ... from the Verturian
Brythons.’ On the question of etymology he has now become
a convert to Mr. Nicholson’s view:<a id="FNanchor_1873" href="#Footnote_1873" class="fnanchor">1873</a> but on the question of ethnology
he retains his own opinion; for, he explains, ‘The non-Celtic
Picts, when we find them coming southwards, seem to have been
fast adopting the idioms of their neighbours.’<a id="FNanchor_1874" href="#Footnote_1874" class="fnanchor">1874</a> Mr. Nicholson<a id="FNanchor_1875" href="#Footnote_1875" class="fnanchor">1875</a>
analyses with laborious ingenuity a large number of names in
Adamnan’s <cite>Life of Columba</cite>, of place-names in the <cite>Pictish Chronicle</cite>,
of Pictish historical names, and of words which occur in the ‘Pictish
inscriptions’, and insists that they are Goidelic: Dr. Whitley
Stokes[1876] and Dr. Macbain[1877] produce words from the same sources,
from Ptolemy’s Geography, and from Dion Cassius, and insist that
they are Brythonic. Dr. Stokes’s authority is so great that his
verdict is worth quoting:&mdash;‘The foregoing list of names and other
words contains much that is still obscure; but on the whole it
shows that Pictish, so far as regards its vocabulary, is an Indo-European
and especially Celtic speech. Its phonetics, so far as we
can ascertain them, resemble those of Welsh rather than of Irish.’<a id="FNanchor_1878" href="#Footnote_1878" class="fnanchor">1878</a></p>

<p>But the arguments for Brythonic, on the one hand, and for Goidelic,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
on the other, leave Professor Rhys unmoved. Prove as
many Pictish words as you please to have been Goidelic, as many as
you please to have been Brythonic: he will regard them with
serene indifference.<a id="FNanchor_1879" href="#Footnote_1879" class="fnanchor">1879</a> For, he tells you,<a id="FNanchor_1880" href="#Footnote_1880" class="fnanchor">1880</a> ‘the Pictish language
would seem to have been rapidly becoming overloaded with loan-words
from Goidelic or Brythonic when we first hear anything
about it. So, failing to recognize this borrowing of words by the
Picts, some have been led to regard Pictish as a kind of Gaelic, and
some as a dialect akin to Welsh. The point to have been decided,
however, was not whether Gaelic or Welsh explains certain words
said to have been in use among the Picts, but whether there does
not remain a residue to which neither Gaelic nor Welsh, nor, indeed,
any Aryan tongue whatever can supply any sort of key.’ The
professor is still thinking of that outlandish inscription which,
according to Mr. Nicholson, is Goidelic, and the professor’s reading
of which, according to Dr. Macbain, is no language at all. But,
admitting provisionally the existence of ‘a residue’ to which no Aryan
language ‘can supply any sort of key’, we should, I must repeat, only
have to conclude that in certain remote parts of the extensive territory
occupied by the Picts a non-Aryan language survived into the
Christian era, just as in a remote part of France a non-Aryan language
survives at this day: we should not have to conclude that that
language was spoken by the Picts in general. ‘La question,’ says
M. d’Arbois de Jubainville, in a notice of Professor Rhys’s article
on the Pictish inscriptions,<a id="FNanchor_1881" href="#Footnote_1881" class="fnanchor">1881</a> ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la question est de savoir si cette population</span>
[the pre-Aryan population] <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">est restée dominante. Les noms
de peuples tels que <i>Smertae</i> ... des noms d’hommes tels que celui du
Calédonien <i>Argentocoxos</i> ... me semblent décisifs.</span>’ It is absolutely
certain, and is insisted upon by Professor Rhys himself, that in
Roman times many of the tribes which were included under the
general designation of Picts bore Celtic names, and that many of
the geographical names in the country which they inhabited were
Celtic also. On the other hand, not a single Pictish name, tribal,
or geographical, or personal, not a single Pictish word which has
been preserved by Ptolemy or by our other authorities, has been
proved to be non-Celtic; and if, as Professor Rhys maintains,
Pictish was a non-Aryan language overlain by loan-words from
the two Celtic dialects, it was so buried beneath them as to be no
longer discernible. Argentocoxos,<a id="FNanchor_1882" href="#Footnote_1882" class="fnanchor">1882</a> as the professor says, was a
Pict, and one of the many Picts whose names were Celtic: if the
Picts had spoken a non-Celtic language, however much overloaded
with Celtic loan-words, would not their own names have been non-Aryan?
As their names were Celtic, it is reasonable to infer that
their language was Celtic also. The professor, it is true, points
out that ‘in Wales many a man has the English name John Jones,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
though he cannot speak English’.<a id="FNanchor_1883" href="#Footnote_1883" class="fnanchor">1883</a> Yes, but the Welsh are a
conquered or, let us say, absorbed people, whereas the professor
himself assures us<a id="FNanchor_1884" href="#Footnote_1884" class="fnanchor">1884</a> that before the time of Ptolemy ‘the Goidels
and the Picto-Brythons [of the North] had come under the power
of the more purely non-Celtic tribes beyond them’.<a id="FNanchor_1885" href="#Footnote_1885" class="fnanchor">1885</a> But this is
of course a pure assertion. The professor fails to prove that any
Celtic people in Britain came under the power of non-Celtic tribes.
Many centuries before the time of Pytheas the neolithic population
had for the most part been reduced to subjection; and, although
remote clans may possibly have retained their individuality, in
many parts of the island the descendants of the aborigines had
become intermingled, first with the ‘Round Barrow’ invaders,
the earlier of whom at all events, as I shall presently show,<a id="FNanchor_1886" href="#Footnote_1886" class="fnanchor">1886</a> were
not Celts, and secondly with the Celts themselves. Professor
Rhys<a id="FNanchor_1887" href="#Footnote_1887" class="fnanchor">1887</a> himself admits that the name of the Picts ‘was never, perhaps,
distinctive of race, as Brythons and Goidels seem to have been
sometimes included under it’; and, although he goes on to say
that ‘the term probably applied most strictly at all times’ to ‘the
non-Celtic natives’, it is not likely that the name of non-Celtic
natives should have prevailed over that of the Celts.</p>

<p>For all these reasons it appears to me infinitely more probable
that in Pictland as, according to Professor Rhys himself, in the
rest of Britain,<a id="FNanchor_1888" href="#Footnote_1888" class="fnanchor">1888</a> the non-Aryan language should have been absorbed
by Celtic than that Celtic should have been absorbed by the non-Aryan
language.</p>

<p>There is probably this grain of truth in Professor Rhys’s theory,
that the non-Celtic natives continued to exist in greater purity in
the country which was occupied by a group of tribes who, during
the latter part of the Roman occupation and afterwards, were
called Picts, than in any other part of Britain. But I doubt whether
this eminent scholar could have spent his time less profitably than
in striving to demonstrate, first, that the language of the Picts was
related to Basque, and, when he was forced to abandon this attempt,
in clinging to the theory that it was a non-Aryan tongue.</p>

<h3 id="PII_CVIII">VIII. THE ROUND-HEADS</h3>

<p>There is, as we have already seen,<a id="FNanchor_1889" href="#Footnote_1889" class="fnanchor">1889</a> sufficient evidence that round-headed
immigrants had begun to appear in Britain towards the
end of the Neolithic Age; but the majority of the prehistoric skulls
of this kind undoubtedly belong to the Age of Bronze. Men of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
same type were living in England at the time of the Saxon invasion;[1890]
and their descendants may be recognized here and there at the present
day.<a id="FNanchor_1891" href="#Footnote_1891" class="fnanchor">1891</a> The prehistoric skeletons have been found not only in
the round barrows of Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Wiltshire,
Dorsetshire, Denbighshire, Man, and Orkney, and in secondary
interments in long barrows, but also in Welsh caverns and graves
and in the short cists of Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_1892" href="#Footnote_1892" class="fnanchor">1892</a> The range of this people in
Britain was, however, it need hardly be said, far wider than that
which the discovery of a few skeletons has indicated.</p>

<p>The round-headed invaders are commonly described as physically
finer men than the neolithic population whom in most parts of
Britain they subdued;<a id="FNanchor_1893" href="#Footnote_1893" class="fnanchor">1893</a> but the truth is that, both in respect of
stature and of cranial form, they belonged to two utterly different
groups, though, as might be expected, some exhibit characteristics
of both.<a id="FNanchor_1894" href="#Footnote_1894" class="fnanchor">1894</a> The average height of 17 brachycephalic men whose
skeletons had been found in round barrows before 1865 would
have been, according to Dr. Beddoe’s estimate, 5 feet 9 inches,
or almost 1 metre 753; while the average height of 27 men of
various cephalic indices, including the 17 just mentioned, whose
skeletons (described in <cite>Crania Britannica</cite>) have been found in
round barrows, would, according to the same authority, have reached
5 feet 9⅖ inches,<a id="FNanchor_1895" href="#Footnote_1895" class="fnanchor">1895</a> or approximately 1 metre 763. Measurements of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
skeletons which have been discovered since the publication of
<cite>Crania Britannica</cite> have yielded results virtually the same.[1896] On
the other hand two groups of skeletons have recently been described
which belonged to a much shorter race. Four, taken from round
barrows in Glamorganshire, showed, according to Dr. Beddoe’s
method, an average height of about 5 feet 5¾ inches;<a id="FNanchor_1897" href="#Footnote_1897" class="fnanchor">1897</a> while 7 male
skeletons, found in short cists in and near Aberdeenshire, ranged,
according to Mr. Alexander Low, between 5 feet and 5 feet 7 inches,
the average being only 5 feet 3 inches.<a id="FNanchor_1898" href="#Footnote_1898" class="fnanchor">1898</a> The skulls of these skeletons
will be presently described.</p>

<p>The cephalic indices of 103 male skulls, found before the year
1894 in round barrows or in other interments of the Bronze Age,[1899]
ranged from 70 to 88, 55 of them exceeding 80; while those of
19 skeletons from round barrows in which no bronze was found
ranged from 68 to 88, six of them exceeding 80.<a id="FNanchor_1900" href="#Footnote_1900" class="fnanchor">1900</a> In both
series a large proportion of the skulls whose indices fell short of
80 belonged, wholly or in part, to the Long Barrow race. Other
skulls, however, which have since been described and of the characteristics
of which Dr. Beddoe, the compiler of this list, may have
been ignorant, yielded indices higher still.<a id="FNanchor_1901" href="#Footnote_1901" class="fnanchor">1901</a></p>

<p>But it is not enough to describe the invaders of the Bronze Age
as brachycephalic: they shared that characteristic with peoples
who were otherwise markedly different from them. Let us first
consider those which belong to the so-called characteristic type,
which, until a recent date, received more than its share of attention,&mdash;that
which is seen only in the taller skeletons. Their foreheads,
says Rolleston, were ‘sometimes ... especially in cases
where the whole skull and skeleton are marked by great strength
and even ruggedness, markedly sloping’.<a id="FNanchor_1902" href="#Footnote_1902" class="fnanchor">1902</a> Their supraciliary ridges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
were often extraordinarily prominent. ‘The eyebrows,’ says the
same authority, ‘must have given a beetling and probably even
formidable appearance to the upper part of the face, whilst the
boldly outstanding and heavy cheek bones must have produced an
impression of raw and rough strength.... Overhung at its root,
the nose must have projected boldly forward.’[1903] These men were,
in some instances, extremely prognathous:<a id="FNanchor_1904" href="#Footnote_1904" class="fnanchor">1904</a> their teeth were often
extraordinarily large;[1905] and, to quote Thurnam, ‘the prominence
of the large incisor and canine teeth is so great as to give an almost
bestial expression to the skull.’[1906] The reader who scans the illustrations
in <cite>Crania Britannica</cite> and in Canon Greenwell’s <cite>British
Barrows</cite> will, however, see that the brachycephalic skulls even of
the taller skeletons are not all of the same type. Moreover, some
few of the Round Barrow skulls combine the contour of the characteristic
brachycephalic skull of the British Bronze Age with dolichocephaly;<a id="FNanchor_1907" href="#Footnote_1907" class="fnanchor">1907</a>
and this is one of the facts which tend to prove that in
certain parts of England the brachycephalic invaders intermarried
with the people whom they found in possession. In the East Riding
of Yorkshire, indeed, it would seem that the old race and the new
were as completely intermingled as the modern population. Dr.
William Wright tells us that in a collection of 80 skulls, taken
from round barrows and preserved in the Mortimer Museum at
Driffield, ‘almost all the varieties of cranial shape met with in
Europe are represented.’ Their cephalic indices ranged from 69
to 92; and, says Dr. Wright, ‘it is doubtful if it is possible to find
a materially more mixed series of skulls in a community of to-day.’<a id="FNanchor_1908" href="#Footnote_1908" class="fnanchor">1908</a>
Dr. Wright, however, does not believe that the skulls of apparently
hybrid form prove intermarriage between the invaders and the old
neolithic population, or that the former were purely brachycephalic.
‘To grant this,’ he argues, ‘one must believe that a pure round-headed
race could have made its tardy progress across Europe
unmixed,&mdash;an assumption which to my mind is incredible.’<a id="FNanchor_1909" href="#Footnote_1909" class="fnanchor">1909</a> Has
the doctor forgotten that ten male skulls, found in short cists in
and near Aberdeenshire and evidently assignable to the end of the
Neolithic or the beginning of the Bronze Age,<a id="FNanchor_1910" href="#Footnote_1910" class="fnanchor">1910</a> were all brachycephalic,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
and that nine of them belonged to the same pure type.<a id="FNanchor_1911" href="#Footnote_1911" class="fnanchor">1911</a>
Has he forgotten that the round barrow skulls of Wiltshire were
mainly brachycephalic? Has he ever walked over the mountains of
Auvergne? Very likely the round-headed race which he has in
mind did not make its way across Europe unmixed; but the mixture
did not greatly diminish the roundness. Very likely when it reached
Britain it included a few long-heads; but the contrast between
the uniformity in Wiltshire and the diversity in East Yorkshire
suffices to disprove the doctor’s theory.</p>

<p>Some of Dr. Wright’s brachycephalic specimens belonged to
a type which is quite different from the ‘characteristic’ Round
Barrow type, and is also common to almost all the short Welsh and
Scottish skeletons mentioned above.<a id="FNanchor_1912" href="#Footnote_1912" class="fnanchor">1912</a> These skulls are generally
broader than those of the other kind. The ten found in Aberdeenshire
and its neighbourhood ranged between 80.8 and 92.3, their
average index being 85.39;<a id="FNanchor_1913" href="#Footnote_1913" class="fnanchor">1913</a> while those of Glamorganshire ranged
between 81.7 and 86, and yielded an average of 84.2.<a id="FNanchor_1914" href="#Footnote_1914" class="fnanchor">1914</a> Not one of
these skulls is prognathous:<a id="FNanchor_1915" href="#Footnote_1915" class="fnanchor">1915</a> all are high as well as round and
broad: the supraciliary ridges are only slightly developed: the
cheek bones are not prominent: the face is both broad and short;
and the lower jaw is small.<a id="FNanchor_1916" href="#Footnote_1916" class="fnanchor">1916</a></p>

<p>Who were the brachycephalic people of the round barrows and
the short cists, and whence did they come? Those who have
attempted to solve these problems have generally had in mind
only the tall round-heads, whether their skulls belonged to the
characteristic type or showed signs of crossing with the other.
Wherever the short people came from, their ethnical affinities are
certain: they belonged to the so-called Alpine type of Central
Europe, of which the French Grenelle race were a branch. Let us
for the present confine our attention to the others. To the questions
which I have asked at least six different answers have been
given:&mdash;that they were Goidelic Celts; that they were Belgae;
that they were Finns; that they came from Denmark or the Scandinavian
peninsula; that their original home was Dalmatia; and,
lastly, that they may be traced back to the valley of the Rhine.<a id="FNanchor_1917" href="#Footnote_1917" class="fnanchor">1917</a>
But the view which has been repeated by almost every recent writer
is that they were Goidels.<a id="FNanchor_1918" href="#Footnote_1918" class="fnanchor">1918</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span></p>

<p>1-2. The Goidelic theory and the Belgic (which I ought perhaps
to apologize for noticing) may be considered together; for if any
argument tells in favour of the latter, it tells as much or more in
favour of the former.</p>

<p>Thurnam, who does not trouble himself about the distinction
between Goidelic and Brythonic Celts, points out that ‘extremely
brachycephalic skulls have been exhumed from many of the French
chambered tumuli’;<a id="FNanchor_1919" href="#Footnote_1919" class="fnanchor">1919</a> that seven skulls with cephalic indices of
80 and upwards from a dolmen near Senlis, which is in the territory
that was occupied by the Belgae, ‘have much resemblance to those
from the round barrows’;<a id="FNanchor_1920" href="#Footnote_1920" class="fnanchor">1920</a> and that three skulls with indices of
80, 80, and 85 respectively from a sepulchral grotto in the Belgic
department of the Oise are ‘very similar in general character to the
short skulls from the round barrows’.<a id="FNanchor_1921" href="#Footnote_1921" class="fnanchor">1921</a> He argues that of the
cranial types represented by the peoples of the long barrows and
the round barrows respectively ‘one at least must be Celtic’:<a id="FNanchor_1922" href="#Footnote_1922" class="fnanchor">1922</a>
he points out that in the cremation interments which have been
discovered in round barrows ‘the appearances are consistent with
what we are told of the funerals of the Gauls ... by Caesar and
Pomponius Mela’;<a id="FNanchor_1923" href="#Footnote_1923" class="fnanchor">1923</a> and his general conclusion is that the Round
Barrow people were ‘an offshoot through the Belgic Gauls from
the great brachycephalic stock of Central and North-Eastern
Europe’.<a id="FNanchor_1924" href="#Footnote_1924" class="fnanchor">1924</a> Finally, Professor Rhys maintained in 1890<a id="FNanchor_1925" href="#Footnote_1925" class="fnanchor">1925</a> (it would
be rash to assume that his opinion is unchanged) that the Round
Barrow race belonged to the Brythonic group, who, he asserted,
being comparatively broad-headed, were less pure than the Goidels.</p>

<p>According to Professor Boyd Dawkins, the Round Barrow race
must have been Goidels, and not Wends, Finns, or Slaves, because
the latter would not have subsequently retreated eastward ‘against
the current of the Celtic, Belgian, and German invasions’;<a id="FNanchor_1926" href="#Footnote_1926" class="fnanchor">1926</a> while
the late Canon Isaac Taylor<a id="FNanchor_1927" href="#Footnote_1927" class="fnanchor">1927</a> affirmed that the skulls of the well-known
‘Sion type’, which by some anthropologists are believed
to have belonged to the Celtic Helvetii, resembled those of the round
barrows.</p>

<p>Now the view that the tall brachycephalic people of the round
barrows were the Belgae is so utterly absurd that it is difficult to
conceive how writers who posed as authorities on ethnology could
ever have entertained it.<a id="FNanchor_1928" href="#Footnote_1928" class="fnanchor">1928</a> If some benighted classical scholar had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
ascribed the Copernican system to Ptolemy, one may imagine how
he would have been derided by scientists; yet such a blunder
would not have been different in degree from that which Thurnam
committed and Huxley approved. For the Belgic invasion began,
at the earliest, in the third, and, as Professor Rhys himself maintains,<a id="FNanchor_1929" href="#Footnote_1929" class="fnanchor">1929</a>
in the second century before the Christian era; and the first
invaders of the Round Barrow race landed in Britain, at the latest,
about 1400 <small>B.C.</small>,<a id="FNanchor_1930" href="#Footnote_1930" class="fnanchor">1930</a> and probably several centuries earlier. The
argument which Thurnam bases upon the alleged similarity between
Round Barrow skulls and some which have been exhumed from
French dolmens has no weight. To begin with, the theory that
any Celtic-speaking people invaded Gaul in the Neolithic Age is
contrary to historical and archaeological evidence;<a id="FNanchor_1931" href="#Footnote_1931" class="fnanchor">1931</a> and, assuming
that they did, the resemblance between the skulls to which Thurnam
refers and most of those of the tall Round Barrow skeletons is purely
superficial. Any one may convince himself of this who will take
the trouble to compare the illustrations of Round Barrow skulls
in <cite>Crania Britannica</cite> with those in <cite>Crania Ethnica</cite>; and Thurnam
himself in more than one passage<a id="FNanchor_1932" href="#Footnote_1932" class="fnanchor">1932</a> admits, indeed emphasizes, the
distinction. Even Broca<a id="FNanchor_1933" href="#Footnote_1933" class="fnanchor">1933</a> denied that there was any physical
affinity between the tall brachycephali of the round barrows and
the [so-called] ‘real Celts of Gaul’; and, as we shall see presently,
by the latter he simply meant the brachycephalic people, descended
from neolithic ancestors, that formed the substratum of the population
whom Caesar called Celtae. Similarly Dr. Beddoe truly says
that the [characteristic] Round Barrow skulls resemble those of
Borreby in the Danish island of Falster, rather than those of
Broca’s Celtae.<a id="FNanchor_1934" href="#Footnote_1934" class="fnanchor">1934</a> It is true indeed, as we have seen, that some of
the Round Barrow skulls resemble some of the neolithic French
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
skulls; but, speaking generally, the former are far more rugged and
in every way more strongly marked than the latter.<a id="FNanchor_1935" href="#Footnote_1935" class="fnanchor">1935</a></p>

<p>More striking, however, than the contrast between the skulls of
the characteristic Round Barrow skeletons and those of the French
brachycephalic neolithic race is the discrepancy in stature. The
average height of the former was, as we have seen, on the lowest
computation, 5 feet 8⅖ inches; that of the latter was very little
over 5 feet.<a id="FNanchor_1936" href="#Footnote_1936" class="fnanchor">1936</a> Moreover, while the brachycephalic Finns and Danes
and the few modern brachycephalic inhabitants of England are
generally tall or moderately tall and fair, those of France and Central
Europe are generally not only short but dark.<a id="FNanchor_1937" href="#Footnote_1937" class="fnanchor">1937</a></p>

<p>The argument that since the Long Barrow skulls were pre-Aryan,
those of the round barrows must have been Celtic, begs the question.
As we shall see presently, there are other skulls in museums, which
belong to neither type, and which undoubtedly are Celtic. What
reason is there to deny that the earlier brachycephalic invaders who
were buried in round barrows may, as Mr. C. H. Read<a id="FNanchor_1938" href="#Footnote_1938" class="fnanchor">1938</a> reasonably
suggests, have been pre-Aryan? The British Celts of the later
Bronze Age were doubtless cremated; and therefore their skulls
are not forthcoming. And if the resemblance between the cremation
interments of the round barrows and those described by Caesar
proved that the former were all Celtic, it would also prove that
they were Greek!<a id="FNanchor_1939" href="#Footnote_1939" class="fnanchor">1939</a></p>

<p>In answer to Professor Boyd Dawkins it may be said that if the
tall Round Barrow race were not Finns or Slaves, it does not follow
that they were Goidels. And supposing that they were Finns or
Slaves, why should it be necessary to assume that they ‘subsequently
retreated eastward against the current of the Celtic, Belgian,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
and German invasions’? Or that they retreated eastward at all?
The ‘Iberian’ immigrants certainly did not retreat ‘against the
current’ of the Round Barrow invaders: they retreated, if at all,
to the remoter parts of Britain. The argument that the Round
Barrow skulls resemble those of the Sion type is disposed of
by merely comparing the measurements and the illustrations of the
two series. The Sion type, as Rolleston<a id="FNanchor_1940" href="#Footnote_1940" class="fnanchor">1940</a> says, ‘corresponds to
many of our long-barrow skulls,’ and is not brachycephalic but
dolichocephalic or mesaticephalic:<a id="FNanchor_1941" href="#Footnote_1941" class="fnanchor">1941</a> there is no proof that it was
that of the Helvetii;<a id="FNanchor_1942" href="#Footnote_1942" class="fnanchor">1942</a> and, as I have pointed out elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_1943" href="#Footnote_1943" class="fnanchor">1943</a> there
is strong reason to believe that the Helvetii did not appear in Switzerland
before the Iron Age.</p>

<p>So much for the arguments which have been adduced in favour
of the popular theory. There are facts which absolutely disprove
it. First, there is no evidence that the brachycephalic people who
built round barrows ever reached Ireland, at least in appreciable
numbers; for not a single skull of the characteristic Round Barrow
type has ever been found there, and only four brachycephalic skulls
which can be referred to prehistoric times.<a id="FNanchor_1944" href="#Footnote_1944" class="fnanchor">1944</a> Yet it is needless to
say that since a time long anterior to the Roman invasion of Britain
Ireland has been one of the principal abodes of the Goidelic stock.
Secondly, it is, as we have seen, in the highest degree probable,
if not certain, that the Round Barrow race first invaded Britain in
the Neolithic Age. Let us, however, for the sake of argument,
accept Professor Boyd Dawkins’s assumption that their advent
synchronized with the beginning of the British Bronze Age. Now,
according to Professor Montelius, the Bronze Age in this country
began about 2000 <small>B.C.</small>; according to Sir John Evans,<a id="FNanchor_1945" href="#Footnote_1945" class="fnanchor">1945</a> six centuries
later. It is impossible to fix with certainty the date of the earliest
Celtic invasion of Britain; but such historical evidence as we possess
points to the conclusion that it was not earlier than the seventh
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
century before the Christian era.<a id="FNanchor_1946" href="#Footnote_1946" class="fnanchor">1946</a> M. Salomon Reinach has argued
that a Celtic-speaking people appeared in North-Western Gaul in
the ninth century,&mdash;the earliest date which has ever been proposed
by any scholar; but his view is based on the mere conjecture that
κασσίτερος,, the Greek word for tin, which occurs in Homer, is of
Celtic derivation.<a id="FNanchor_1947" href="#Footnote_1947" class="fnanchor">1947</a> M. d’Arbois de Jubainville, indeed, who adopts
this conjecture,<a id="FNanchor_1948" href="#Footnote_1948" class="fnanchor">1948</a> supposes that the Celts actually landed in Britain
as early as the ninth century before Christ; but even if we accept
his chronology, we are confronted with the fact that the very earliest
date that has been assigned on historical or linguistic grounds for
the first Celtic invasion<a id="FNanchor_1949" href="#Footnote_1949" class="fnanchor">1949</a> is four or five centuries later than the
latest, ten or eleven centuries later than the earliest date which
has been assigned by archaeologists for the commencement of the
Bronze Age in Britain. Yet anthropologists and antiquaries will
go on repeating the dogma that the builders of the round barrows,
who, at the latest, began to arrive in Britain at the commencement
of the Bronze Age, were Goidelic Celts. The moral is that anthropologists
and antiquaries would not be worse equipped if they
enlarged the sphere of their studies.</p>

<p>Again, the view that a Celtic-speaking people invaded Britain
at the close of the Neolithic or the beginning of the Bronze Age
implies that Celtic and Latin, the nearest of kin in the Aryan family
of languages, had become differentiated long before the Neolithic
Age came to its end. Would any philologist who knew the rudiments
of archaeology sanction a theory so preposterous?<a id="FNanchor_1950" href="#Footnote_1950" class="fnanchor">1950</a></p>

<p>The foregoing arguments apply equally to the short men whose
remains have been found in the greatest purity in North-Eastern
Scotland. The race to which they belonged began to arrive in
Gaul very early in the Neolithic Age:<a id="FNanchor_1951" href="#Footnote_1951" class="fnanchor">1951</a> they themselves landed in
Britain before its close. Whoever they may have been, they were
neither Goidels nor Belgae nor Brythons of any tribe.</p>

<p>Finally, although I am aware that I am about to tread upon
thorny ground, I affirm that there is not the slightest reason to
doubt that the Celtic invaders of Britain, in so far as they were
descended from the Celtic-speaking people who conquered Gaul,
were not a brachycephalic but a dolichocephalic or mesaticephalic
people. I have already argued in favour of this thesis in a dissertation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
on ‘the Ethnology of Gaul’,<a id="FNanchor_1952" href="#Footnote_1952" class="fnanchor">1952</a> and I will now adduce fresh
evidence in its favour. But first let me make my meaning perfectly
clear. I do not mean that the Celtic invaders of Britain were all
of the same type. On the contrary, I assume that the dominant
race had intermixed and intermarried, before they embarked from
the Continent, with descendants of the neolithic stocks. I do not
mean that even the invaders who introduced the Celtic language
into Gaul, even those who beat the Romans on the Allia, were
homogeneous. Dr. Beddoe, as I have remarked elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_1953" href="#Footnote_1953" class="fnanchor">1953</a> warns
us not to believe that there was ever a period when, for example,
all the Caledonians were red-haired. I only mean that among the
Celtic-speaking conquerors of Britain dolichocephaly, as well as
tallness and fairness, was a prevailing characteristic.</p>

<p>Thurnam<a id="FNanchor_1954" href="#Footnote_1954" class="fnanchor">1954</a> asserted that ‘we may ask in vain for a series of
ancient dolichocephalic skulls which, on satisfactory archaeological
grounds, can be assigned to the immediately pre-Roman, and therefore
to the Celtic period, either in England or in France’. Let us
consider England first. Now it happens that the skulls of the
‘Late Celtic’ period, or Early Iron Age, which have been found
in this country are almost all either dolichocephalic or mesaticephalic.<a id="FNanchor_1955" href="#Footnote_1955" class="fnanchor">1955</a>
Canon Greenwell,<a id="FNanchor_1956" href="#Footnote_1956" class="fnanchor">1956</a> it is true, explains this fact by the
assumption that ‘the intruding round-headed people ... were
gradually absorbed by the earlier and more numerous [Long Barrow]
race’. ‘In this way,’ he says, ‘it appears to me that we may
account for the skull type of the Early Iron Age without the necessity
of requiring any immigration into Britain or its conquest after
the time of the presumed occupation by the bronze-using round-headed
people,’ &amp;c. But that necessity is imperative. Had Canon
Greenwell momentarily forgotten his Caesar? The immigration
of the Belgae took place, at the earliest, in the third century <small>B.C.</small>,
many centuries after the ‘occupation by the bronze-using round-headed
people’. It is true that some of the British skulls which
belong to the Late Celtic period are of the same type as those of the
Long Barrow race:<a id="FNanchor_1957" href="#Footnote_1957" class="fnanchor">1957</a> but this only proves that the Long Barrow
race survived; and others are of a type which, as Rolleston says,
is ‘entirely wanting ... in the series from the long barrows’.<a id="FNanchor_1958" href="#Footnote_1958" class="fnanchor">1958</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
Unfortunately, however, the Late Celtic skulls which have been
found in Britain are comparatively few;<a id="FNanchor_1959" href="#Footnote_1959" class="fnanchor">1959</a> and hardly any of them
can be assigned with certainty to the Brythonic invaders.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span></p>

<p>In France, on the other hand, the skulls of the corresponding
period are very numerous; but few of them have been measured.
Those few, however, confirm my argument. They belonged with
very few exceptions to tall mesaticephalic or dolichocephalic men;
and two of them may be seen in Salles IX and X of the Musée de
St. Germain, near Paris, the former having been buried with his
war-chariot, iron helmet, and long iron sword. The mean index
of twenty-seven adult male skulls of this type, found in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tumuli</i> of
the Early Iron Age in the department of the Marne, was 78.49;
but Broca, who has described them, maintains that the index of
skulls of the purest ‘Kymric’ (or, to use the term which is now in
vogue, ‘Galatic’) type would be considerably lower; for, he
argues, as the Gauls of the Marne lived very near the frontier of
the Celtae, they must have intermarried with the brachycephalic
people who formed the great majority of that group of tribes.<a id="FNanchor_1960" href="#Footnote_1960" class="fnanchor">1960</a></p>

<p>Again, in a recent article on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tumuli</i> of the Early Iron Age in the
department of the Côte-d’Or, Dr. Hamy points to the noteworthy
fact that two brachycephalic skulls, belonging to descendants of an
earlier race, were found ‘among the dolichocephali who predominated
in that population’;<a id="FNanchor_1961" href="#Footnote_1961" class="fnanchor">1961</a> and in a paper which he has just
published on the earliest Gallic invaders of the Iron Age he shows
that the cephalic indices of the available skulls from the Châtillonnais
and the arrondissement of Beaune range between 73.1 and
76.59, while the average stature was 1 metre 75.7, or just over
5 feet 9⅛ inches.<a id="FNanchor_1962" href="#Footnote_1962" class="fnanchor">1962</a></p>

<p>The prevalent view in this country is, I am aware, that the Celts
were a brachycephalic people; but it is begotten of sheer confusion
of thought. Professor Ripley<a id="FNanchor_1963" href="#Footnote_1963" class="fnanchor">1963</a> remarks that ‘there is practically
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
to-day a complete unanimity of opinion among physical anthropologists,
that the term <i>Celt</i>, if used at all, belongs to the brachycephalic
darkish population of the Alpine highlands’; and he adds that the
only dissentient is M. G. de Lapouge.<a id="FNanchor_1964" href="#Footnote_1964" class="fnanchor">1964</a> But Dr. Beddoe,<a id="FNanchor_1965" href="#Footnote_1965" class="fnanchor">1965</a> whom he
counts among the professors of the orthodox faith, has emphatically
recorded his opinion that, at the time of the Roman conquest, the
Celtic-speaking people of Southern Britain ‘partook more of the tall
blond stock of Northern Europe than of the thick-set, broad-headed
dark stock which Broca has called Celtic’; and the ‘unanimity’
(which is far from being ‘complete’) upon which Professor Ripley
pins his faith is due partly to misunderstanding or misinterpretation
of Broca’s famous essay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qu’est-ce que les Celtes</i>, partly to the desire
of establishing a uniform connotation, and partly to the fact that
some physical anthropologists have neglected to supplement their
scientific researches by the study of classical texts. Broca found the
term ‘Celt’ used in a multiplicity of senses, and he attempted to
put an end to confusion by attaching to it one limited, conventional,
and, as we shall see, misleading signification. When, in the essay to
which I have just referred, he endeavoured to prove that the Celts
were a dark brachycephalic people, he expressly limited the term
‘Celts’ to the population of that part of Gaul which, according to
Caesar,<a id="FNanchor_1966" href="#Footnote_1966" class="fnanchor">1966</a> was inhabited by ‘a people who call themselves Celts and
whom we [the Romans] call Gauls’. ‘There is no proof,’ he insists,
‘that the existence in the British Isles of a people bearing the name
of Celts has ever been authoritatively affirmed’:<a id="FNanchor_1967" href="#Footnote_1967" class="fnanchor">1967</a> according to him, the
invaders of Britain who spoke the so-called Celtic languages were the
Belgae,<a id="FNanchor_1968" href="#Footnote_1968" class="fnanchor">1968</a> for he knew nothing about Goidels or pre-Belgic Brythons;
and, although he allowed himself to be persuaded that the tall Round
Barrow race spoke Celtic, he denied ‘that there is any other affinity
except that of language between the brachycephali of the round
barrows and the real Celts of Gaul’.<a id="FNanchor_1969" href="#Footnote_1969" class="fnanchor">1969</a> When he insisted that ‘the
Celts’ were a dark brachycephalic people, he did not mean that
darkness and brachycephaly were characteristic of the conquerors who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
introduced the Celtic language into Gaul: he meant that they were
characteristic of the great mass of the mixed population whom Caesar
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Celtae</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1970" href="#Footnote_1970" class="fnanchor">1970</a> who were in the main descended from neolithic invaders,
and whose uppermost stratum, so to speak, consisted of invaders
whom Broca, speaking as a physical anthropologist rather than a
philologist, called ‘Kimris’.<a id="FNanchor_1971" href="#Footnote_1971" class="fnanchor">1971</a> That the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Celtae</i> did not belong
to the people of Gaul until it was introduced by these Celtic-speaking
‘Kimris’ is evident from the fact that it belongs to the Celtic tongue:<a id="FNanchor_1972" href="#Footnote_1972" class="fnanchor">1972</a>
in other words, the Celts, anthropologically speaking, were originally
identical with the invaders who introduced the Celtic language first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
into Germany and then into Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_1973" href="#Footnote_1973" class="fnanchor">1973</a> These invaders were tall and
mesaticephalic or dolichocephalic; and the Celtic-speaking conquerors
of Britain belonged to the same stock.</p>

<p>‘The radical errors in Broca’s definition of the “Celts of history”
[so I wrote some years ago<a id="FNanchor_1974" href="#Footnote_1974" class="fnanchor">1974</a>] are these:&mdash;first, he calmly assumes that
no classical writer’s testimony, except Caesar’s, is of any value; and
secondly, he fails to see that Caesar, by saying that the people who
called themselves “Celts” were called by the Romans “Gauls”,
makes it as clear as noon-day that for him and for his countrymen,
as for Polybius and Pausanias, the words “Celt” and “Gaul” were
synonymous. Broca admits that the older population of Gallia
Celtica was conquered by men of the same race as the Gauls or Celts
who captured Rome. Therefore it is absolutely certain that the
Celtae of Transalpine Gaul were called after their conquerors. The
truth is that Broca, while he aimed at putting an end to confusion,
only made confusion worse confounded. Moreover, throughout his
discussion, <i>he simply ignores the Helvetii, who, according to Caesar,
were included among the Celtae</i>.’</p>

<p>Since the foregoing paragraph was written, I have lighted upon
a passage<a id="FNanchor_1975" href="#Footnote_1975" class="fnanchor">1975</a> in which Broca himself justifies my argument and uses the
word ‘Celt’ in the sense which I attach to it. The Celtae of Gaul, he
remarks, ‘were already mixed before the arrival of the Kimris [or
Gallo-Brythonic invaders], since the name [Celtae] under which they
appeared for the first time in history had been imposed upon them
by the conquering race of the Celts properly so called, which, like
the Kimris and the Germans, came from the east, and, like them, was
dolichocephalic.’<a id="FNanchor_1976" href="#Footnote_1976" class="fnanchor">1976</a></p>

<p>Professor Ripley appeals to the German ethnologist, Johannes
Ranke,<a id="FNanchor_1977" href="#Footnote_1977" class="fnanchor">1977</a> whose arguments, he insists, are ‘decisive’. But any one
who will take the trouble to read the chapter which Ranke devotes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
to the Celts will see that his argument does not support Professor
Ripley’s contention. Virchow, he reminds us, has pointed out that
wherever the Celts are known to have penetrated dark peoples are
now to be found. But, as he fully admits, Virchow himself said,
‘I am not on that account inclined to assume that the original Celts
were ... dark,’ and reminded his readers that the ancient writers
described the Celts as fair. Ranke points out, further, that wherever
the Celts originally dwelled in Central Europe we now find the people
not only dark but also brachycephalic; but at the same time he warns
us to bear in mind that in certain Celtic districts of Britain dolichocephaly
is unmistakable, and that there is evidence that on the Continent
<i>the Celtic invaders found a dark brachycephalic people in possession</i>.
In other words, Ranke does not commit himself to any
theory as to the physical characters of the Celts properly so called,&mdash;the
invaders who introduced the Celtic dialects into Germany, Gaul,
Britain, and other countries which they subdued. The reader will
also bear in mind that the writers who identify the tall brachycephalic
Round Barrow race with the Goidelic Celts unanimously maintain
that they were fair.</p>

<p>That the Celtic-speaking invaders of Gaul and Britain were
commonly dolichocephalic or mesaticephalic is not only attested by
the skulls of warriors of the Iron Age, but is either attested or at least
not disproved by the results of modern observations of existing Celtic-speaking
peoples<a id="FNanchor_1978" href="#Footnote_1978" class="fnanchor">1978</a> and of the country which was formerly inhabited
by the Gallic Belgae.<a id="FNanchor_1979" href="#Footnote_1979" class="fnanchor">1979</a> When Sergi<a id="FNanchor_1980" href="#Footnote_1980" class="fnanchor">1980</a> tells us that the Gauls who captured
Rome were ‘composed of brunet Celts and blond Teutons’, he makes
an assertion which, as it is absolutely unsupported by any evidence,
calls for no refutation; and it would be useless to ask him who were
the ‘blond Teutons’ who were the ancestors of the red-haired Gauls
of the Perthshire Highlands.<a id="FNanchor_1981" href="#Footnote_1981" class="fnanchor">1981</a> As Dr. Beddoe<a id="FNanchor_1982" href="#Footnote_1982" class="fnanchor">1982</a> puts it, the Gauls of
Scotland are probably descended from ‘Iberians’ crossed with
‘a long-faced, harsh-featured, red-haired race, who contributed the
language and much of the character’.<a id="FNanchor_1983" href="#Footnote_1983" class="fnanchor">1983</a></p>

<p>3. The late Mr. Charles Elton,<a id="FNanchor_1984" href="#Footnote_1984" class="fnanchor">1984</a> referring to Professor A. H.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
Sayce’s <cite>Science of Language</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_1985" href="#Footnote_1985" class="fnanchor">1985</a> affirmed that ‘a Finnish idiom has been
traced in several of the British languages’, and inferred that the tall
builders of the round barrows were Finns. The idiom in question
may, for aught that I know, have been traced by some philologist
who had determined to find it, but not by Professor Sayce nor by
any one to whom Professor Sayce refers. Mr. Elton’s argument is
as obsolete as that which Professor Rhys founded upon his imaginary
tracing of Basque in the language of the Picts.</p>

<p>4. Much may be said for the theory of the late Professor Rolleston,
that the tall people of the round barrows came from Denmark or
some of the adjoining islands, if it be duly modified. On the coast
near Flamborough Head are remains of earthworks, which, as has
been demonstrated by General Pitt-Rivers, who excavated them,
were erected by invaders fighting their way inland; and, as he
remarks, ‘it is unlikely that any but Northmen should have landed
in this spot.’<a id="FNanchor_1986" href="#Footnote_1986" class="fnanchor">1986</a> Thurnam himself admits that there is ‘a great
resemblance’ between the characteristic Round Barrow skulls and
those from ‘the Giants’ Chamber at Borreby [in the island of Falster],
and from other Scandinavian megalithic tombs’;<a id="FNanchor_1987" href="#Footnote_1987" class="fnanchor">1987</a> and his testimony
is confirmed by Rolleston<a id="FNanchor_1988" href="#Footnote_1988" class="fnanchor">1988</a> and Dr. Beddoe.<a id="FNanchor_1989" href="#Footnote_1989" class="fnanchor">1989</a></p>

<p>Dr. A. H. Keane<a id="FNanchor_1990" href="#Footnote_1990" class="fnanchor">1990</a> argues, in opposition to Rolleston’s view, that if
any of the Round Barrow invaders had come from Scandinavia,
‘they must have spoken some Low German dialect, of which there
are no clear traces in the tribal and place-names of the Bronze Age.’
The answer is, first, that, as Mr. C. H. Read<a id="FNanchor_1991" href="#Footnote_1991" class="fnanchor">1991</a> suggests, they may have
spoken not a Low German but a pre-Aryan dialect; and, secondly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
that we know absolutely nothing about either the tribal or the place-names
of Britain in the Bronze Age. Assuming that Low German
tribal or place-names existed in Britain before the Celtic invasion,
they would for the most part have been superseded by Celtic names,
just as the Celtic invaders of Gaul generally substituted their own
tribal and place-names for those of their predecessors, and just as
in certain parts of Scotland Celtic names of rivers gave place to Norse
names.<a id="FNanchor_1992" href="#Footnote_1992" class="fnanchor">1992</a></p>

<p>5. Messrs. J. Gray and J. F. Tocher infer from their observations
of the physical characteristics of the population of West Aberdeenshire
that ‘a tall, broad-headed, dark-haired, light-eyed people’,
whom they regard as ‘the descendants of the men of the Bronze Age’,
formerly inhabited Aberdeenshire, but were driven inland by later
blond immigrants, who were shorter and had narrower heads, and
whom they identify with North Germans.<a id="FNanchor_1993" href="#Footnote_1993" class="fnanchor">1993</a> The resemblance of
the tall dark people to modern Dalmatians<a id="FNanchor_1994" href="#Footnote_1994" class="fnanchor">1994</a> is, they say, ‘significant
when taken in conjunction with the fact that bronze first came into
the British Isles from South-East Europe.’</p>

<p>‘The fact!’ But is it the fact? Archaeology has certainly shown
that Britain, in the Bronze Age, was commercially connected with
Northern France, which, as Mr. C. H. Read<a id="FNanchor_1995" href="#Footnote_1995" class="fnanchor">1995</a> says, was ‘supplied to
a certain extent from Italy’. But no archaeologist supposes that
bronze was carried all the way from Italy, still less from Dalmatia, into
Britain or even into Northern France by Italians or Dalmatians.
It came through the methods of primitive commerce. Moreover, as
we have already seen,<a id="FNanchor_1996" href="#Footnote_1996" class="fnanchor">1996</a> ‘the men of the Bronze Age,’ by whom
Messrs. Gray and Tocher mean the tall brachycephalic people of the
round barrows, were still in their Stone Age when they began to
invade Britain. A direct immigration from the coasts of the Adriatic
into West Aberdeenshire or even Southern Britain is inconceivable;
and if it had taken place gradually across the Continent, we should
find that the immigrants had left traces of their presence on the way,
which is not the case. Notwithstanding the thoroughness with which
Messrs. Gray and Tocher conducted their investigation, I fear that it
throws no new light upon the ethnology of Ancient Britain. After
the successive invasions and immigrations, the internal migrations,
and the intermarriages of 3,000 years, it is utterly impossible to
establish by dint of even the most elaborate census of a living population
the fact that the people of the Bronze Age even in West
Aberdeenshire were ‘tall, broad-headed, dark-haired, and light-eyed’;
and if they were, why only in West Aberdeenshire?</p>

<p>6. The Honourable John Abercromby maintains that the brachycephalic
invaders, or some of them, came at the beginning of the
Bronze Age or in the period of transition between the Neolithic Age
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
and the Bronze Age from the neighbourhood of the middle Rhine or
from some intermediate district between it and Britain.<a id="FNanchor_1997" href="#Footnote_1997" class="fnanchor">1997</a> Remarking<a id="FNanchor_1998" href="#Footnote_1998" class="fnanchor">1998</a>
that ‘the recorded finds of the last hundred years are sufficient to
establish the fact that the beaker [or drinking-cup] is the oldest form
of fictilia in the Bronze Age of this country’, he argues that the immigrants
who introduced the oldest drinking-cups of the kind which
Thurnam designated as ‘type β’ must have belonged to a tribe who
at one time lived in the valley of the Rhine, because between British
and Rhenish specimens of this type ‘there is a substantial agreement’
both in form and ornament, which ‘seems too great to be the result
of pure accident’; and he points out<a id="FNanchor_1999" href="#Footnote_1999" class="fnanchor">1999</a> that ‘the type exists not only
in the central Rhine, but also near its mouth’, though the intermediate
stages cannot be traced. The Rhenish cups belong to the
Neolithic Age; and it seems impossible to prove that the earliest
British examples were not made before any objects of bronze were
manufactured in or introduced into Britain:<a id="FNanchor_2000" href="#Footnote_2000" class="fnanchor">2000</a> but Mr. Abercromby
has certainly established a very strong probability in favour of the
locality to which he refers their origin.<a id="FNanchor_2001" href="#Footnote_2001" class="fnanchor">2001</a></p>

<p>The great mistake that has been made in discussing the question is
the not uncommon assumption that the brachycephalic immigrants
who buried their dead in round barrows arrived in Britain at one
time and came from one place. Some of them certainly appeared
before the end of the Neolithic Age: others may have introduced
bronze implements or ornaments; others doubtless came, in successive
hordes, during the course of the Bronze Age. Some of those who
belonged to the Grenelle race, who certainly came from Eastern
Europe and possibly from Asia,<a id="FNanchor_2002" href="#Footnote_2002" class="fnanchor">2002</a> and whose centre of dispersion was
the Alpine region,<a id="FNanchor_2003" href="#Footnote_2003" class="fnanchor">2003</a> may have started from Gaul;<a id="FNanchor_2004" href="#Footnote_2004" class="fnanchor">2004</a> others could have
traced their origin to some Rhenish tribe; and I am inclined to believe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
that those who belonged to the characteristic rugged Round Barrow
type crossed over, for the most part, from Denmark or the outlying
islands. That the first Celtic-speaking invaders landed in Britain
before the end of the Bronze Age I do not deny; and if they came
from that part of Gaul which was inhabited by the Celtae, I have no
doubt that many of them were brachycephalic. But it is nevertheless
certain that among these invaders the dominant element, who were
Celtic in blood as well as in speech, and whose physical type was that
described by the ancient writers, were not brachycephalic but mesaticephalic
or dolichocephalic. And if I am asked where the Celtic
skulls of the later British Bronze Age are to be found, I answer,
Nowhere: they were reduced to ashes by cremation.<a id="FNanchor_2005" href="#Footnote_2005" class="fnanchor">2005</a></p>

<p>It is interesting to find that, according to Huxley, of the skeletons
that were found in the famous Heathery Burn Cave, near Durham,
which was inhabited in the closing period of the Bronze Age, not one
belonged to either of the brachycephalic types, but all to ‘the same
race of rather small and lightly-made men with prominent superciliary
ridges and projecting nasal bones’<a id="FNanchor_2006" href="#Footnote_2006" class="fnanchor">2006</a> which is represented by the
river-bed skulls of England and Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_2007" href="#Footnote_2007" class="fnanchor">2007</a></p>

<h3 id="PII_CIX">IX. THE CELTS</h3>

<p>1. Little can be added to what has been said in the previous
section about the physical characteristics of the Celtic invaders of
Britain. Some Celtic scholars, as we shall presently see,<a id="FNanchor_2008" href="#Footnote_2008" class="fnanchor">2008</a> deny that
any Goidels reached this country before the Roman conquest; but,
assuming that some did so, there is no reason to suppose that they
differed much physically from the Brythons. If Strabo<a id="FNanchor_2009" href="#Footnote_2009" class="fnanchor">2009</a> was right in
saying that the Britons generally were less fair-haired than the Gauls,
the inference would seem to be that the Celtic invaders of Britain
had intermarried more freely than those of Gaul with the descendants
of the aborigines; nor would this inference be weakened by the fact
that, according to the same authority,<a id="FNanchor_2010" href="#Footnote_2010" class="fnanchor">2010</a> they were conspicuously taller
than their Gallic kinsmen.<a id="FNanchor_2011" href="#Footnote_2011" class="fnanchor">2011</a> I believe, however, that Strabo’s statements
were based upon nothing more than his own observation of
the few Britons whom he says that he himself saw in Rome, supplemented
perhaps by hearsay evidence derived from Roman soldiers
or traders who were not trained observers; and that his testimony
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
is worth neither more nor less than that of Lucan, who speaks of
‘the fair-haired Britons’.<a id="FNanchor_2012" href="#Footnote_2012" class="fnanchor">2012</a> Dr. Beddoe<a id="FNanchor_2013" href="#Footnote_2013" class="fnanchor">2013</a> has concluded, from his
observation of the modern inhabitants of ‘those parts of Scotland
and the north of England where Kymric blood may well be supposed
to remain in large proportion,’ that the Belgae who invaded Britain
as well as those of Gaul were on the whole somewhat dark: but his
arguments, which I have examined fully elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_2014" href="#Footnote_2014" class="fnanchor">2014</a> do not prove that
the dominant Celts among the Belgae were dark, but simply that,
before they invaded Britain, they had become largely intermixed
with an older dark population, and that, since they reached this
country, they and their descendants have intermarried with people
darker than themselves.<a id="FNanchor_2015" href="#Footnote_2015" class="fnanchor">2015</a></p>

<p>2. Professor Rhys has more than once changed his opinion about
the Celtic invaders of Britain since he began to handle the subject.
In the second edition of his <cite>Lectures on Welsh Philology</cite><a id="FNanchor_2016" href="#Footnote_2016" class="fnanchor">2016</a> he argued
that they were not ‘two distinct nationalities, speaking two distinct
languages’; in other words, he maintained that the Goidelic and
Brythonic dialects had been evolved within the British Isles after
the Celts had entered them. In the preface to <cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, however,
which was written in January, 1884, he recanted; and his old
view is now obsolete. For many years past he has maintained that
the earliest invaders were Goidels, or, as he now prefers to call them,
Celticans;<a id="FNanchor_2017" href="#Footnote_2017" class="fnanchor">2017</a> and that the later comers were Brythons. But whereas
until a recent date he held that the only Brythonic invasion was that
of the Belgae, and that Pytheas, who visited Britain towards the end
of the fourth century <small>B.C.</small>, ‘is not likely to have found any Brythons
here,’<a id="FNanchor_2018" href="#Footnote_2018" class="fnanchor">2018</a> he now holds, or at all events held a few weeks before the
time when I am writing, that the first Brythonic invaders ‘appear
to have settled here before the middle of the fourth century B. C., for
Pytheas ... gives indirect evidence to their presence’.<a id="FNanchor_2019" href="#Footnote_2019" class="fnanchor">2019</a> To this
view I hope he will firmly adhere. There is, indeed, no direct evidence
that any Brythonic immigrants landed in Britain before the
Belgae. But indirect evidence there is; and that of two kinds.
The first has been already noticed in the section on the Picts. There
are good grounds for believing that the authority whom Diodorus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
Siculus followed in his notices of Britain was Pytheas.<a id="FNanchor_2020" href="#Footnote_2020" class="fnanchor">2020</a> Diodorus
speaks of the British Isles as Πρετ(τ)ανικαὶ νῆσοι;<a id="FNanchor_2021" href="#Footnote_2021" class="fnanchor">2021</a> and the <i>P</i> in
Πρετ(τ)ανικαί (if that reading is certain), shows that Pytheas learned
the word from lips which spoke a Brythonic, or Gaulish dialect.
M. d’Arbois de Jubainville asserts that his informants were Gauls:<a id="FNanchor_2022" href="#Footnote_2022" class="fnanchor">2022</a>
but that is simply his opinion; it is open to any one to argue that
Pytheas probably learned the name of the Britons as well as the facts
which he reported about them and their country in Britain, and not
in Gaul. Be this, however, as it may, it is, as we shall presently see,
certain that during the earlier period of the Roman occupation, the
greater part of England and a considerable part of Scotland were
inhabited by Brythons; and, as we shall also see, it is extremely
improbable that they were all of Belgic origin. The question of the
chronological order of the various Celtic invasions is, according to
Professor Rhys,<a id="FNanchor_2023" href="#Footnote_2023" class="fnanchor">2023</a> answered by the present geographical distribution of
the Celtic-speaking peoples of the British Isles: ‘it may be regarded,’
he says, ‘as fairly certain that those who are found driven furthest to
the west were the earliest comers.’ The argument might be sound
enough (though the word ‘driven’ begs the question) if we were
considering the British Isles as a whole, and not merely Britain;<a id="FNanchor_2024" href="#Footnote_2024" class="fnanchor">2024</a>
and even those who maintain that there were no people of Goidelic
descent in Britain in the time of Caesar could hardly answer Professor
Rhys unless they assumed that the Goidelic invaders of Ireland came
from Spain, or that they dared not risk a contest with the Southern
Britons; for otherwise it is hard to believe that they would not
have directed their immigration towards Britain, the nearer country.</p>

<p>Professor Rhys, in his <cite>Celtic Britain</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_2025" href="#Footnote_2025" class="fnanchor">2025</a> endeavours to trace the distribution
of the Brythonic and Goidelic peoples, as he believes it to
have existed at the time of the coming of the Romans; and in so
doing he uses materials on which he founds another argument to
show that there were Goidels in Britain at that time. These materials
are Goidelic inscriptions which have been found in North Wales, in
Cornwall, and in Devonshire:<a id="FNanchor_2026" href="#Footnote_2026" class="fnanchor">2026</a> but not one of them belongs to an
earlier date than the fifth century of our era. With the exception of
the districts in which they occur, of the greater part of Somersetshire
and Dorsetshire, of South Wales and the adjoining parts of England
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
which lie between the Severn and the Teme, and of Cumberland, part
of Westmorland, the Isle of Man, Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Wigtown,
Ayrshire, Renfrew, and part of Lanarkshire, the professor regards the
whole of Britain south of the Firths of Clyde and Forth as Brythonic;
and he prints a list of proper names, most of which are certainly
Brythonic, in support of this conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_2027" href="#Footnote_2027" class="fnanchor">2027</a> The northern part of the
island he divides, for reasons which have been already examined,
between Goidels and aboriginal tribes, whom he identifies with the
Picts properly so called.<a id="FNanchor_2028" href="#Footnote_2028" class="fnanchor">2028</a> It will, however, of course be understood
that when he speaks of Goidelic and Brythonic tribes, he means tribes
who spoke the Goidelic and Brythonic dialects. The former he regards
as mingled largely with the aborigines, and the latter with
both Goidels and aborigines. But it is difficult to understand how
he has been able to maintain that the Dumnonii of Cornwall and
Devonshire were Goidels in the face of the fact that most of the
British emigrants who invaded Brittany came from the Cornish
peninsula,<a id="FNanchor_2029" href="#Footnote_2029" class="fnanchor">2029</a> bringing the name <i>Dumnonii</i> with them, and that he
himself formerly insisted that the Dumnonii who inhabited what
is now Renfrew and Ayrshire were Brythons.<a id="FNanchor_2030" href="#Footnote_2030" class="fnanchor">2030</a> I say ‘formerly’,
because this is one of the many opinions which the professor has felt
obliged to discard: ‘the southern portion’ of the Scottish Dumnonii
have just been transformed by a stroke of the pen into ‘Goidels who
adopted Brythonic speech’.<a id="FNanchor_2031" href="#Footnote_2031" class="fnanchor">2031</a> However, as M. d’Arbois de Jubainville
says, referring to the inscriptions upon which Professor Rhys
relies, ‘To conclude from the fact that five Goidels were buried,
during the period which elapsed from about 400 to about 700 <small>A.D.</small>, in
the territory of the Dumnonii, that the entire population of that
territory was Goidelic seems extremely rash;’<a id="FNanchor_2032" href="#Footnote_2032" class="fnanchor">2032</a> and, he asks,<a id="FNanchor_2033" href="#Footnote_2033" class="fnanchor">2033</a> ‘if
they were Goidels, how came it that they brought a Brythonic dialect
into Brittany?’ Further, he asks why Professor Rhys maintains
that the Novantae of Galloway were Goidels when he admits that the
Trinovantes of Essex were Brythons;<a id="FNanchor_2034" href="#Footnote_2034" class="fnanchor">2034</a> and the only answer which
the professor vouchsafes to this question is that the name <i>Novantae</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
was ‘given them probably by Brythons’.<a id="FNanchor_2035" href="#Footnote_2035" class="fnanchor">2035</a> What are the grounds of
his opinion, he does not say. I may add that while he explains<a id="FNanchor_2036" href="#Footnote_2036" class="fnanchor">2036</a> that
‘the consonantal combination of <i>cs</i> or <i>x</i>’ is Gaulish, that is to say,
Gallo-Brythonic, he says<a id="FNanchor_2037" href="#Footnote_2037" class="fnanchor">2037</a> that it is ‘remarkable’ that ‘most of the
early names with <i>x</i> belong to districts which have before been pointed
out as non-Brythonic’. When we look for these districts, we find<a id="FNanchor_2038" href="#Footnote_2038" class="fnanchor">2038</a>
that they were those of the Taexali, the Vacomagi, the Scottish
Dumnonii, the Selgovae, and Cumberland. When we ask on what
grounds the inhabitants of these districts had been ‘pointed out as
non-Brythonic’, we find<a id="FNanchor_2039" href="#Footnote_2039" class="fnanchor">2039</a> that the Taexali and the Vacomagi were
Pictish, that is to say ‘no doubt’ aboriginal; that the Dumnonii,
according to the professor himself,<a id="FNanchor_2040" href="#Footnote_2040" class="fnanchor">2040</a> were ‘undoubtedly Brythons’,
and remained so until, discovering perhaps that he had inadvertently
given his case away, he changed them by his enchanter’s wand into
‘Goidels who adopted Brythonic speech’;<a id="FNanchor_2041" href="#Footnote_2041" class="fnanchor">2041</a> and that the Selgovae
are asserted to have been, like the Novantae, ‘in a great measure ... most
likely a remnant of the aboriginial inhabitants.’<a id="FNanchor_2042" href="#Footnote_2042" class="fnanchor">2042</a> Why?
Because they were afterwards included under the name <i>Atecotti</i>,
which ‘appears to have meant old or ancient’, and was ‘possibly
given to them by the Brythons’.<a id="FNanchor_2043" href="#Footnote_2043" class="fnanchor">2043</a> Doubtless they were ‘in a great
measure’ aboriginal, as were doubtless all the British tribes; but
seeing that <i>Uxellon</i>, the name of a town in their country, is Gaulish,
the natural conclusion is that their Celtic masters were not Goidels
but Brythons.</p>

<p>3. Professor Kuno Meyer holds that ‘no Gael ever set his foot on
British soil save on a vessel that had put out from Ireland’;<a id="FNanchor_2044" href="#Footnote_2044" class="fnanchor">2044</a> and
his words are echoed by Dr. Macbain.<a id="FNanchor_2045" href="#Footnote_2045" class="fnanchor">2045</a> Professor Meyer points out
that ‘we have the concurrent testimony of Irish and Welsh tradition
that from the second century of our era till the sixth a series of partial
conquests of Britain took place’.<a id="FNanchor_2046" href="#Footnote_2046" class="fnanchor">2046</a> Dr. Beddoe<a id="FNanchor_2047" href="#Footnote_2047" class="fnanchor">2047</a> has indeed argued
that it is extremely improbable that ‘the Romans would have
allowed the Irish Gael to acquire by violence possession of a large
portion of one of their provinces’; and Professor Meyer, who admits
the difficulty, says that he will not attempt to explain it away. He
might have noted that the author of the panegyric which was
addressed <small>A.D.</small> 296 to Constantius Chlorus<a id="FNanchor_2048" href="#Footnote_2048" class="fnanchor">2048</a> expressly affirms that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
such invasions did take place. Professor Meyer also points out that
the Gaelic inscriptions which have been found in Southern Britain
belong almost exclusively to South Wales, the quarter to which the
invasions may be assumed to have been directed, very few having
come to light in North Wales, Devonshire, and Cornwall.<a id="FNanchor_2049" href="#Footnote_2049" class="fnanchor">2049</a> On the
other hand, it will be admitted that the record of these invasions is
no proof that Goidels had not settled in Britain in pre-Roman times.</p>

<p>4. M. d’Arbois de Jubainville holds, as we have already seen,<a id="FNanchor_2050" href="#Footnote_2050" class="fnanchor">2050</a> that
Goidels, or rather a people who spoke ‘the Celtic dialect from which
Goidelic was evolved’,<a id="FNanchor_2051" href="#Footnote_2051" class="fnanchor">2051</a> were masters of the British Isles in the time
of Pytheas, and that between his time and that of Caesar Britain
was conquered by the Cymric Brittones. So far he is substantially
in agreement with the view which, until a recent date, commended
itself to Professor Rhys,<a id="FNanchor_2052" href="#Footnote_2052" class="fnanchor">2052</a> who, as the reader knows, now believes that
there were two successive Brythonic invasions.<a id="FNanchor_2053" href="#Footnote_2053" class="fnanchor">2053</a> The more important
differences between the two scholars lie partly in their views, which
have been already examined, of the Pictish question; partly in the
fact that M. d’Arbois is unable to accept the evidence which satisfies
Professor Rhys that in Caesar’s time and later Goidelic tribes still
remained in Western and Northern Britain. He holds that many of
them had been driven by the Belgae into Ireland, and that in Britain
they only survived as a vanquished people who had been forced to
adopt the language of their Gaulish conquerors.<a id="FNanchor_2054" href="#Footnote_2054" class="fnanchor">2054</a> I am inclined to
believe, from the analogy of Gaul,<a id="FNanchor_2055" href="#Footnote_2055" class="fnanchor">2055</a> that in Caesar’s time Goidelic
was still spoken in remoter parts of the island.</p>

<p>5. Mr. Nicholson has recently attempted to prove that all his
predecessors are entirely mistaken even on the few points on which
they are agreed. According to him, the earliest Celtic invaders of
the British Isles were Brythons, whom, however, he prefers to call
Kymri; after them came a horde of Goidels; in the third century
before Christ the Picts, who were also Goidels, invaded Scotland;
and finally came the Belgae, who were Goidels too! The result was
that ‘apparently the great majority of the tribes inhabiting Roman
Britain were Goidels’,<a id="FNanchor_2056" href="#Footnote_2056" class="fnanchor">2056</a> although ‘of the later Kymric recovery and
victory in Wales and some other parts there is no manner of doubt’.<a id="FNanchor_2057" href="#Footnote_2057" class="fnanchor">2057</a>
It will, at all events, be admitted that a victory, however late, gained
by a small minority, was no mean achievement.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span></p>

<p>How does Mr. Nicholson set about proving this revolutionary
theory? He tells us that ‘on the map of Roman Britain’ he can only
see one ‘certainly Kymric geographical name’<a id="FNanchor_2058" href="#Footnote_2058" class="fnanchor">2058</a>&mdash;Pennocrucium
(now Penkridge) in Staffordshire. The long lists of Cymric names
which have been drawn up by Professor Rhys, Dr. Whitley Stokes,
M. d’Arbois de Jubainville, and Dr. Macbain do not move him at
all. When he is confronted with geographical, tribal, or personal
names belonging to Pictland&mdash;names such as <i>Argentocoxos</i>, <i>Epidii</i>,
<i>Gartnait</i>, the <i>Ochil</i> Hills, and the prefixes <i>aber</i> and <i>pet</i>&mdash;he either
ignores them or, as his opponents would say, explains them away.<a id="FNanchor_2059" href="#Footnote_2059" class="fnanchor">2059</a>
Professor Rhys’s list<a id="FNanchor_2060" href="#Footnote_2060" class="fnanchor">2060</a> is disposed of with the same breezy self-confidence.
<i>Corstopiton</i>, <i>Epeiacon</i>, (Mons) <i>Graupius</i>, <i>Leucopibia</i>, <i>Maponi</i>,
<i>Parisi</i>, <i>Petuaria</i>, <i>Prasutagos</i>, <i>Rutupiae</i>, <i>Toliapis</i>,&mdash;these names are
either left out of account or explained as Goidelic by the simple
method of affirming or ‘suspecting’ that the <i>p</i> in each case is ‘Indo-European’.<a id="FNanchor_2061" href="#Footnote_2061" class="fnanchor">2061</a>
The reader will form his own opinion if he can; only
he will bear in mind that the weight of authority is all on one side.
When doctors disagree, the patient must decide for himself which is
the quack.</p>

<p>So much for the assertion that the Goidels, who, according to
Professor Kuno Meyer and Dr. Macbain, were non-existent in Britain
at the time when the Roman conquest began, formed then ‘the
great majority’ of the population. What is the evidence for the
theory that they came later than the Brythons?</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Celts who first entered Gaul were
Goidels<a id="FNanchor_2062" href="#Footnote_2062" class="fnanchor">2062</a> (assuming that Goidelic was then a distinct dialect<a id="FNanchor_2063" href="#Footnote_2063" class="fnanchor">2063</a>), and
that the latest Celtic invaders of Gaul as of Britain were Belgae.<a id="FNanchor_2064" href="#Footnote_2064" class="fnanchor">2064</a>
If the Belgae had been Goidels, we should then have to admit that
Gaul was invaded first by Goidels, then by ‘Cymri’, and finally by
Goidels again. Is this likely? And is it not likely that if Goidels
were the first Celts who invaded Gaul, they were also the first who
invaded Britain?</p>

<p>Mr. Nicholson offers the following arguments in favour of his theory.
Remarking that the Menapii were a Belgic tribe, he says<a id="FNanchor_2065" href="#Footnote_2065" class="fnanchor">2065</a> that ‘the
Isle of Man(n) [which Caesar calls <i>Mona</i>] is called <i>Monapia</i> by Pliny
(iv, 103)’; and that the Gaelic dialect which is spoken in the island
is evidence that its inhabitants in Pliny’s time were Goidels.</p>

<p>Now I ask, first, is it certain that Pliny’s <i>Monapia</i>, rather than
Caesar’s <i>Mona</i>, was the name by which the Isle of Man was known
to its own inhabitants? Is it not probable that the name <i>Monapia,</i>
which is, at all events presumably, Brythonic, came to Pliny from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
a Brythonic source?<a id="FNanchor_2066" href="#Footnote_2066" class="fnanchor">2066</a> Secondly, assuming that the names <i>Monapia</i>
and <i>Menapii</i> are etymologically connected, does it necessarily follow
that <i>Monapia</i> was a name peculiar to the Belgae, seeing that the
tribal name <i>Ceutrones</i> occurs not only in Belgic Gaul but in the Alps?<a id="FNanchor_2067" href="#Footnote_2067" class="fnanchor">2067</a>
Thirdly, is Mr. Nicholson prepared to prove that the Isle of Man was
not colonized by Goidels after it had received the name <i>Monapia</i> from
Brythons? Lastly, since Mr. Nicholson himself affirms<a id="FNanchor_2068" href="#Footnote_2068" class="fnanchor">2068</a> that although
the name <i>Aremorici</i> is ‘certainly Kymric’, it nevertheless ‘is
no proof that the Aremoricans were Kymric’, why does he insist that
the fact, if it is a fact, that <i>Monapia</i> was Goidelic proves that the
Belgae were Goidels?</p>

<p>Again, he says that the Parisi, who lived near the mouth of the
Humber, were Belgae,<a id="FNanchor_2069" href="#Footnote_2069" class="fnanchor">2069</a> and he believes that ‘their name preserves
Indo-European <i>p</i>’.<a id="FNanchor_2070" href="#Footnote_2070" class="fnanchor">2070</a> But Caesar did not include the Gallic Parisii
among the Belgae, and did include them among the Celtae.<a id="FNanchor_2071" href="#Footnote_2071" class="fnanchor">2071</a>
Mr. Nicholson’s belief, that the <i>p</i> in their name is Indo-European, is
not shared by any other Celtic scholar.</p>

<p>Thirdly, he argues that the Atrebates, who were certainly Belgae,
were Goidels; for, he says,<a id="FNanchor_2072" href="#Footnote_2072" class="fnanchor">2072</a> ‘With one exception, no ogam-inscription
has ever been found in these isles outside territory which
is known to have been once in Goidelic occupation. The single exception
is that of the stone found at Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester).’
But, according to Mr. Nicholson himself, ‘the great majority’ of the
British tribes were Goidelic: yet in only a small minority of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
territories are ogam inscriptions forthcoming; and that minority,
with the possible exception of the Atrebates, is in the west of
England. What then is proved by the solitary inscription at Silchester?
The individual who erected it was doubtless a Goidel:<a id="FNanchor_2073" href="#Footnote_2073" class="fnanchor">2073</a>
but if it is to be regarded as a proof that the Atrebates were Goidels,
then the existence of synagogues in Great Britain proves the truth of
that widespread delusion which Professor Tylor<a id="FNanchor_2074" href="#Footnote_2074" class="fnanchor">2074</a> has described as
‘abject nonsense’,&mdash;the ‘Anglo-Israel theory’.<a id="FNanchor_2075" href="#Footnote_2075" class="fnanchor">2075</a></p>

<p>Fourthly, Mr. Nicholson remarks<a id="FNanchor_2076" href="#Footnote_2076" class="fnanchor">2076</a> that between the Parisi and
the Iceni, the name of whose king, Prasutagus,<a id="FNanchor_2077" href="#Footnote_2077" class="fnanchor">2077</a> he regards ‘as
containing Ind.-Eur. <i>p</i>’, while all other Celtic scholars regard
it as Brythonic, dwelled the Coritani.<a id="FNanchor_2078" href="#Footnote_2078" class="fnanchor">2078</a> ‘From their position on
the coast,’ he says, ‘they should belong to the same Picto-Belgic
family, and I submit that their name is simply Qṛtanoi, Cruitni.’
In other words, Mr. Nicholson submits that a single tribe, which he
assumes to have been Belgic, called itself by the same name which,
on his own showing,<a id="FNanchor_2079" href="#Footnote_2079" class="fnanchor">2079</a> had been given to the entire population of
Great Britain<a id="FNanchor_2080" href="#Footnote_2080" class="fnanchor">2080</a> long before the Belgae set foot in the land!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span></p>

<p>6. I have set down the gist of the linguistic evidence which has
been offered in support of the various theories about the Goidels and
the Brythons in order that the reader may be able to form an independent
judgement about its value. It goes without saying that on
any particular question of Celtic etymology no opinion except that of
a competent Celtic scholar is worth listening to: on most of the
questions that concern us competent Celtic scholars differ widely
among themselves: Professor Rhys differs from himself; and
Mr. Nicholson, whose competence I neither affirm nor deny, differs
from everybody. Even the lay reader who has studied the writings
of Dr. Windisch, of Professor Rhys, of Dr. Whitley Stokes, of Dr.
Macbain, of Mr. Nicholson, and of M. d’Arbois de Jubainville, and
who has made much use of Alfred Holder’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Alt-celtischer Sprachschatz</cite>
cannot but see how few of the etymologies that relate to ethnology
are to be accepted as certain. It would of course be absurd to sneer
at the services which philology has rendered to ethnology and history;
nevertheless the fact remains that on almost all the fundamental
questions of Celtic ethnology the philologists agree to differ. And,
at the risk of appearing flippant, I cannot help saying that when I
read some of Mr. Nicholson’s pages, when I see how M. Salomon
Reinach demonstrates, with the approval of M. d’Arbois de Jubainville
and of Professor Rhys, who for once find themselves in agreement,
that κασσίτερος, the Greek word for tin, must be of Celtic
derivation because the root <i>cassi-</i> is found in numerous Celtic names,<a id="FNanchor_2081" href="#Footnote_2081" class="fnanchor">2081</a>
I ask myself whether some future philologist will not adduce the
similarity between <i>Tamesis</i> and <i>Tamesi</i>, the name of a Mexican
river, as a proof that the Celts once colonized Central America;
whether he will not compare the name of Admiral Togo with that of
the British prince, Togo-dumnos, and prove that ‘the Japanese
Nelson’ was of Celtic extraction.<a id="FNanchor_2082" href="#Footnote_2082" class="fnanchor">2082</a></p>

<p>7. Caesar, in a familiar passage, states that ‘the maritime districts
[of Britain are inhabited] by people who crossed over from Belgium
to plunder and attack [the aborigines], almost all of them being
called after the tribes from whom the invaders were an offshoot’.<a id="FNanchor_2083" href="#Footnote_2083" class="fnanchor">2083</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
It is, however, impossible to define the limits of the region which, in
Caesar’s time and during the period that elapsed between the date
of his departure and that of the Claudian conquest, was occupied by
the Belgae. The only tribal names that indicate their presence are
those of the Catuvellauni,<a id="FNanchor_2084" href="#Footnote_2084" class="fnanchor">2084</a> who, about the commencement of the
Christian era, occupied a territory of uncertain area round Verulamium,
or St. Albans, which included Hertfordshire, Middlesex, and
probably parts of Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and Northamptonshire;
the Atrebates, who possessed parts of Hampshire and Berkshire;
and the Belgae, whose chief towns, according to Ptolemy,<a id="FNanchor_2085" href="#Footnote_2085" class="fnanchor">2085</a>
were Aquae Calidae, or Bath, and Venta, or Winchester.<a id="FNanchor_2086" href="#Footnote_2086" class="fnanchor">2086</a> Caesar’s
words would certainly lead us to believe that the Cantii, the Trinovantes,
and the Regni were also Belgic peoples, although their
names do not occur in the list of the Belgic tribes of Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_2087" href="#Footnote_2087" class="fnanchor">2087</a> Professor
Rhys indeed affirmed in the second edition of <cite>Celtic Britain</cite><a id="FNanchor_2088" href="#Footnote_2088" class="fnanchor">2088</a>
that ‘there is no evidence that the Cantii ... should be considered
Belgic’; and this statement is repeated in the edition which has
recently been published: one feels therefore that the evolution of
the professor’s views is quite normal when one reads in an intermediate
volume, published two years ago,<a id="FNanchor_2089" href="#Footnote_2089" class="fnanchor">2089</a> that the earliest Belgic
invaders of Britain were probably the Brittani,<a id="FNanchor_2090" href="#Footnote_2090" class="fnanchor">2090</a> and that the Brittani
were probably the Cantii.</p>

<p>8. Finally, Dr. Macalister regards certain skeletons which have
been found in the War Ditches of Cambridgeshire below layers
that contained traces of late Roman occupation as Anglian<a id="FNanchor_2091" href="#Footnote_2091" class="fnanchor">2091</a>; and
it may be that they testify to a pre-Roman immigration from
Northern Germany.

<h3 id="PII_CX">X. CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>For the sake of clearness I shall summarize the results which this
inquiry has attained. No human remains, except those of Bury
St. Edmunds and Cattedown, which can be certainly attributed to
the Quaternary Period have been found in Britain; but it is probable
that the earlier inhabitants belonged in part to the Neanderthal
stock, and that towards the close of the Palaeolithic Age they
were joined by immigrants akin to the Chancelade people of the
Lozère valley. There is no conclusive evidence that the earliest
neolithic invaders found this island inhabited; but it has not been
demonstrated that even here there was a ‘hiatus’ between the
Old and the New Stone Age. The source of the first neolithic influx
was probably in France, in the southern parts of which at all events
the latest palaeolithic and the earliest neolithic inhabitants were akin.
The neolithic invaders who built the long barrows of Southern
Britain and the chambered cairns of Scotland, and many of whom
built round barrows also, were a branch of the ‘Mediterranean’ race,
and likewise came from France, perhaps in some cases originally
from the Spanish peninsula; but if they are to be called ‘Iberian’
the term must be regarded as conventional. There is no evidence
that they were related more nearly to the Basques than to some other
branch of the Mediterranean stock.<a id="FNanchor_2092" href="#Footnote_2092" class="fnanchor">2092</a> They certainly spoke a non-Aryan
language; and so probably did the earlier brachycephalic
invaders, of whom the first comers landed in Britain before the end
of the Neolithic Age. These invaders&mdash;the principal builders of the
round barrows and the short cists&mdash;continued to arrive in successive
hordes during the earlier part of the Bronze Age, some probably
from Gaul, some from the Low Countries and the valley of the Rhine,
and others, who settled in Yorkshire and Northumberland and
perhaps in Derbyshire, from Denmark or Danish islands and possibly
also from the Scandinavian peninsula. The brachycephalic Round
Barrow skulls fall under two different types. Some resemble those
of the French Grenelle race&mdash;in other words, the so-called Alpine race
of Central Europe&mdash;and, like them, belonged to individuals of low
stature; although the general superiority of the Bronze Age Britons
in this respect is so great as to preclude the supposition that men of
the pure Grenelle type invaded Britain in considerable numbers:
others illustrate the rugged and, in some cases, almost brutal type
which Thurnam and Rolleston have so forcibly described; and
some of those of Yorkshire, especially Rudstone, and Northumberland
exhibit these characteristics in such a degree that they may almost
be grouped apart. The majority would seem to show that people of
the two types intermarried, as they certainly did with the dolichocephalic
neolithic population. The first Celtic invaders were Goidels,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
who certainly reached Ireland in the Bronze Age, and who may be
supposed to have settled in Britain also before the time of Pytheas.
The first Brythonic immigrants probably inaugurated the Iron Age
in this country, and began to arrive a short time before the visit of
Pytheas. They were succeeded by the Belgae, who, like them, came
in successive hordes, the first probably in the third century before
Christ. The Belgae and the other Brythons spread over the greater
part of Southern Britain and many parts of Scotland. Both they
and the Goidels were doubtless mixed with people of the ‘Iberian’
and Grenelle races with whom they had intermarried before they left
the Continent; but the purer representatives of the two Celtic
stocks&mdash;the descendants of the invaders who had introduced the
Celtic languages into Gaul and of their continental kinsmen&mdash;belonged
to a type different from both of the Round Barrow types,
being not only tall and generally fair but dolichocephalic or mesaticephalic.
A people characterized by dolichocephaly and low stature,
who apparently were not descended from the Long Barrow race, but
whose affinities are doubtful, were settled in the Early Iron Age in East
Yorkshire, and, it would seem, nowhere else in Britain. The Picts
of Romano-British history were a medley of tribes, among whom
Celts were, as everywhere, predominant, but who probably included
a greater proportion of the descendants of the neolithic and other
pre-Aryan peoples than any other British group. It is possible that
in the remoter parts of Pictland a non-Aryan dialect was still spoken
when the Romans invaded Britain; but the pre-Aryan Picts as a
whole had been Celticized, and the Celtic language had prevailed,
although it had been largely modified by the speech with which it
had come in contact. Everywhere in Britain the pre-Roman stocks
have, in greater or less proportions, survived.<a id="FNanchor_2093" href="#Footnote_2093" class="fnanchor">2093</a> Few Englishmen,
Welshmen, or Scotsmen, if their pedigrees could be traced back far
enough, would not be found to count among their ancestors men of
the type who were buried in long barrows, sturdy warriors of the
Bronze Age, and Celts who fought against Caesar or were subdued
by Agricola.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The study of ethnology is as fascinating to its votaries, partly by
reason of its very difficulty, as the attempt to determine the distances
of the less remote stars must have been to Bessel, Henderson, and
Struve; but I can sympathize with those to whom, in both cases,
the quest of knowledge for its own sake appears equally unprofitable.
They may well ask the ethnologist why he does not proceed to
deduce from what he knows conclusions that would interest all
students of history and of human nature. ‘There are few fields,’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
says Professor Bury,<a id="FNanchor_2094" href="#Footnote_2094" class="fnanchor">2094</a> ‘where more work is to be done or where
labourers are more needed than the Celtic civilisations of Western
Europe. In tracing from its origins the course of western history
in the Middle Ages, we are pulled up on the threshold by the uncertainties
and obscurities which brood over the Celtic world. And
for the purpose of prosecuting that most difficult of all inquiries, the
ethnical problem, the part played by race in the developement of
peoples and the effects of race blendings, it must be remembered
that the Celtic world commands one of the chief portals of ingress
into that mysterious prae-Aryan foreworld, from which it may well be
that we modern Europeans have inherited far more than we dream.’
But when we have entered the ‘prae-Aryan foreworld’, how shall
we map out its various provinces, and what clue shall we have gained
to the solution of ‘the ethnical problem’? That is as complex as the
problem, which theoretically may not be insoluble, of forecasting
remote meteorological as accurately as astronomical phenomena;
and its solution is more hopeless still. We want to know what contributions
the various British races which we have identified made to
the formation of the British character, which is so obviously different
from that of any other nation, and which is, so to speak, the generalized
manifestation of the characters of the English, Scottish, and
Welsh peoples, and, descending the scale, of the characters of the
inhabitants of every district, and finally of every man.<a id="FNanchor_2095" href="#Footnote_2095" class="fnanchor">2095</a> Again,
we want to trace the manifold sources from which the ‘Celtic’
character, with the idiosyncrasies of which we are all more or
less familiar, is derived. But the Celtic character is not everywhere
the same. Study it in Wales, in Man, in the Scottish
Highlands, in Ireland, in Cornwall, in France, and you will find
that while it is Celtic everywhere, everywhere it is different;<a id="FNanchor_2096" href="#Footnote_2096" class="fnanchor">2096</a> that
everywhere it has become what it is because it is compounded,
in different degrees, not only of Celtic, not only of pre-Celtic and
pre-Aryan, but also of post-Celtic elements. And all these elements
have been modified and moulded by different geographical and
climatic influences and by adventitious circumstances too numerous
to be particularized and too elusive to be estimated.<a id="FNanchor_2097" href="#Footnote_2097" class="fnanchor">2097</a> Those who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
know Ireland well have observed that the character of Anglo-Irishmen,
whose blood is neither more nor less Celtic than that of many
Englishmen, has acquired a quasi-Irish tinge, which is discernible
in their children even when they have been born and bred in England;
and this sets us thinking, though we think in vain. We all know
the passage in which Mommsen compares the Gauls to the modern
Irish: the ethnologist knows enough to see that it is as misleading
as it is brilliant; but he knows too little to attempt to rewrite it.
Anthropologically speaking, the Gauls (I use the word in its most
comprehensive sense) were very different from the modern and
indeed from the ancient Irish; and if Mommsen’s analogy were
more than superficial, we should be forced to conclude that the
character of the Gauls, as it is revealed in ancient writings, was that
of the dominant Celts, perhaps mostly Gallo-Brythonic, alone; and
that the character of the Irish is simply that of Celts, mostly Goidelic,
who were once but have long ceased to be dominant. Who will
attempt to differentiate the respective shares of the pre-Aryan Long
Barrow race, of the few representatives of the pre-Aryan Grenelle
race who settled in this land, of the tall harsh-featured Round
Barrow people, of the Goidels, and finally of the Brythons in building
up the character which was to be further modified by the Roman,
the Saxon, the Dane, the Norman, the Fleming, and aliens of every
nationality, who each and all contributed something to a result
which, influenced by the Continent, by the Far West, and now by
the Far East, is still in process of evolution?

<h2 id="PII_Pg459">THE NAMES ΠΡΕΤΑΝΙΚΑΙ ΝΗΣΟΙ,
<i>BRITANNI</i> <small>AND</small> <i>BRITANNIA</i></h2>

<p>Πρεττανοί, which (written with a single τ) is supposed to represent
the Brythonic or the Gaulish equivalent of a Goidelic word <i>Qrtanoi</i>&mdash;the
assumed progenitor of the Irish <i>Cruthni</i><a id="FNanchor_2098" href="#Footnote_2098" class="fnanchor">2098</a>&mdash;is found in certain
manuscripts of Strabo<a id="FNanchor_2099" href="#Footnote_2099" class="fnanchor">2099</a> instead of the more usual Βρεττανοί: Diodorus
Siculus<a id="FNanchor_2100" href="#Footnote_2100" class="fnanchor">2100</a> (who derived part of his information about the British Isles
indirectly from Pytheas<a id="FNanchor_2101" href="#Footnote_2101" class="fnanchor">2101</a>) Strabo, Ptolemy,<a id="FNanchor_2102" href="#Footnote_2102" class="fnanchor">2102</a> and Marcian,<a id="FNanchor_2103" href="#Footnote_2103" class="fnanchor">2103</a> appear
to have described them as Πρετανικαὶ νῆσοι, for perhaps they were
not responsible for the ττ which appears in manuscripts; and
Stephanus of Byzantium speaks of Πρετανίας and Πρετανίδες.<a id="FNanchor_2104" href="#Footnote_2104" class="fnanchor">2104</a>
According to Professor Rhys<a id="FNanchor_2105" href="#Footnote_2105" class="fnanchor">2105</a> and M. d’Arbois de Jubainville,<a id="FNanchor_2106" href="#Footnote_2106" class="fnanchor">2106</a> the
form Βρεττανικαὶ (νῆσοι), which occurs in most of the manuscripts, is to
be accounted for by the fact that <i>Brittani</i>, the Goidelic name of the
Brythonic invaders of Britain, which had no connexion with Πρετανοί,
was eventually confounded with it: ‘the confusion,’ says Professor
Rhys, ‘is to be detected in the ττ of Πρεττανική;’<a id="FNanchor_2107" href="#Footnote_2107" class="fnanchor">2107</a> and he attributes
it to scribes. The questions connected with all these names are
very difficult. The first puzzle is this:&mdash;if, as the professor says,<a id="FNanchor_2108" href="#Footnote_2108" class="fnanchor">2108</a>
Πρετανικαὶ νῆσοι, ‘under the influence of the name of the Brythons,
Βρεττανοί, became at last Βρεττανικαὶ νῆσοι, that is to say “Brythonic
isles”,’ why did Diodorus Siculus, Ptolemy, and Marcian
persist in calling them Πρετανικαὶ νῆσοι? Again, the professor’s views
about the Brittani, who, he tells us, called themselves Brittones, have
lately undergone a sweeping change. In 1902<a id="FNanchor_2109" href="#Footnote_2109" class="fnanchor">2109</a> he regarded ‘the first
of the Belgic peoples to cross over to this country’ as an offshoot of
‘the Brittani or Brittones whom Pliny seems to have found so called
in the valley of the Somme’ (and whom, by the way, Pliny,<a id="FNanchor_2110" href="#Footnote_2110" class="fnanchor">2110</a> whatever
he may have found them called, called neither Brittani nor Brittones,
but Britanni); and he considered that their name, ‘from being
exclusively that of the first settlers, came to be extended to the
successive hordes, so that at the last it actually denoted all the settlers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
here of Belgic descent.’ But the Britanni who are mentioned by
Pliny were a Belgic tribe of such small importance that Caesar either
ignored or had never heard of them; and, granting that some of
them invaded Britain, of which there is no evidence, it is to the last
degree improbable that they rather than the Belgae, of whom they
would only have formed an item, should have imposed their name
upon the people of the whole island. In 1902 Professor Rhys maintained
that the Brythonic invaders of Britain were all Belgae. In
1904<a id="FNanchor_2111" href="#Footnote_2111" class="fnanchor">2111</a> he distinguished the Belgae from the other Brythons, maintained
that they were the second group of Brythonic invaders, and
gave the name <i>Brittones</i> not only to them but also to their predecessors.
Whether or not he still holds that these two groups of Brittones
derived their name from Pliny’s Britanni, I cannot say. If so, it is
somewhat puzzling that one tribe of the so-called Brittones were
the Belgae, who presumably called themselves after the Gallic group
of tribes which, as a whole, was designated by that name: the professor’s
theory would lead to the startling conclusion that while
a single horde of the second group of Brythonic invaders were called
<i>Belgae</i> after the entire nation of which they were an offshoot, the two
Brythonic groups of invaders, Belgic and non-Belgic alike, were
conjointly called after the most obscure tribe of the second group!
He explains the name <i>Brittones</i> as connected with the Welsh <i lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">breithyn</i>,
cloth, and concludes that ‘the word Brython and its congeners
meant a clothed or cloth-clad people’, and that ‘the race with which
the Brythons contrasted themselves to their own satisfaction, when
they began to give themselves that name, was probably some of the
aboriginal tribes whose home they invaded on the Continent’.<a id="FNanchor_2112" href="#Footnote_2112" class="fnanchor">2112</a>
But if so, it seems wellnigh inexplicable that none of the Continental
Belgae, none of the other Gauls, were called either Brittones or
Brittani, and that only one petty Belgic tribe, which was unknown
to or unnoticed by Caesar, was even called Britanni. As Windisch
says,<a id="FNanchor_2113" href="#Footnote_2113" class="fnanchor">2113</a> Professor Rhys’s etymology has to contend with serious
difficulties; and it must, I think, be admitted that if the Brythons
were called either Brittani or Brittones, the mention by Pliny of the
Belgic Britanni throws no light upon the origin of the name. It
is perhaps conceivable that, as Dr. Macbain<a id="FNanchor_2114" href="#Footnote_2114" class="fnanchor">2114</a> has suggested, ‘the
tribe on the Somme were some returned emigrants from Britain.’</p>

<p>Britain, says Professor Rhys, is traceable to <i>Britannia</i>, and
<i>Britannia</i> to <i>Britanni</i>,&mdash;‘the Latin name of the people’. He observes
that the Greek form of <i>Britanni</i> was Βρεττανοί, and he adds
that ‘the practical identity between the Latin and Greek forms
makes it probable that it was from or through the Greeks of Marseilles
that the Romans first heard of these islands. This,’ he continues,
‘is not all, for the Latin <i>Brittanni</i>, and especially the Greek Βρεττανοί,
have their exact counterpart in the Medieval Irish plurals Bretain,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
genitive Bretan, which had at times to function as the name both of
the Brythons and of the island. It is to be noticed that neither
Βρεττανοί or Britanni, nor the Irish Bretain has anything corresponding
to it in the dialects of the Brythons themselves. From
whom, then, did the Greeks hear the word which served as the
basis of their names for Britain and its people? It cannot have
been from the Brythonic peoples of the south-east of the island, or
any, perhaps, of the Gauls of the Continent: it was probably from
the natives of the south-west who brought their tin to market, and
in whose country the only Celtic speech in use was as yet Goidelic.
When, however, the Romans came to Britain they learnt the
name which the Brythons gave themselves in the south-east of
the island, and this was not Britanni, or Brettani, but Brĭttŏnes.’<a id="FNanchor_2115" href="#Footnote_2115" class="fnanchor">2115</a>
On the other hand, Dr. Macbain<a id="FNanchor_2116" href="#Footnote_2116" class="fnanchor">2116</a> suggests that the ‘Greek form
Prettania [or rather <i>Pretania</i>, the form which is assumed to have
been derived from <i>Priten</i> or its older equivalent, and indirectly from
<i>Qrtanoi</i>] gave rise to the name Britain,&mdash;a bad Latin pronunciation’.
Mr. Nicholson objects that ‘in neither Greek nor Latin is <i>p</i> known
to pass into <i>b</i>’.<a id="FNanchor_2117" href="#Footnote_2117" class="fnanchor">2117</a> Is it possible that the Latin pronunciation, if it
was bad, may have been traceable to a bad Greek pronunciation,
which gave rise to Polybius’s<a id="FNanchor_2118" href="#Footnote_2118" class="fnanchor">2118</a> Βρεττανικαί (νῆσοι), and which was
itself due to a defect not in pronunciation but in hearing?</p>

<p>Those who, like Professor Tylor, reject the theory that certain
savage tribes have no religious belief would probably accept the evidence
which Lord Avebury<a id="FNanchor_2119" href="#Footnote_2119" class="fnanchor">2119</a> adduces in its favour: only they attach
to the word Religion a meaning different from his. Indeed he himself,
in one passage,<a id="FNanchor_2120" href="#Footnote_2120" class="fnanchor">2120</a> uses the word in Professor Tylor’s sense; for he
remarks that ‘one of the lowest forms of religion is that presented by
the Australians, which consists of a mere unreasoning belief in the
existence of mysterious beings’; and he admits that religion, in
this sense, ‘is general to the human race.’<a id="FNanchor_2121" href="#Footnote_2121" class="fnanchor">2121</a> Dr. Frazer, however,
would apparently refuse to make even this concession. He is, or was,
inclined to believe that ‘faith in magic is probably older than a belief
in spirits’;<a id="FNanchor_2122" href="#Footnote_2122" class="fnanchor">2122</a> for ‘magic is nothing but a mistaken application of the
very simplest ... processes of the mind, namely, the association of
ideas by virtue of resemblance or contiguity’, while ‘religion assumes
the operation of conscious or personal agents, superior to man, behind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
the visible screen of nature. Obviously,’ he continues, ‘the conception
of personal agents is more complex than a simple recognition
of the similarity or contiguity of ideas.’<a id="FNanchor_2123" href="#Footnote_2123" class="fnanchor">2123</a> I can only say that to me
this is not obvious; the fancy of a primitive savage that fire, running
water&mdash;everything that moves&mdash;is alive, is doubtless a less rudimentary
mental act than the fear of a horse that a traction-engine
is a formidable monster, but the difference is only one of degree.<a id="FNanchor_2124" href="#Footnote_2124" class="fnanchor">2124</a>
And Dr. Frazer’s definition of magic is singularly narrow: magic
and religion were rooted in the same soil; and their branches intertwined.<a id="FNanchor_2125" href="#Footnote_2125" class="fnanchor">2125</a></p>

<p>To M. Salomon Reinach also ‘it appears evident that the true
primitive savage ... does not believe himself to be surrounded by
spirits; he is in the state which Herbert Spencer calls <i>passive atheism</i> ... The
most backward primitive savages whom we know are in the
neolithic age.... The superstition (δεισιδαιμονία, dread of demons)
which dominates their whole existence ... is ... the outcome of a
long evolution.’<a id="FNanchor_2126" href="#Footnote_2126" class="fnanchor">2126</a> But did not the process begin when the primitive
savage, conscious of life, fancied that sun and stars, flood and fire
were also alive? And how can M. Reinach make it ‘evident’ that
there ever was a savage so primitive that he had no such fancy?
It is not true that the most backward savages whom we know, or at
least have known, are in the Neolithic Age. The Tasmanians, a hundred
years ago, were in their Palaeolithic Age, but they believed themselves
to be surrounded by spirits.<a id="FNanchor_2127" href="#Footnote_2127" class="fnanchor">2127</a> Lord Avebury indeed affirms
that ‘some races entirely disbelieve in the survival of the soul after
the death of the body’;<a id="FNanchor_2128" href="#Footnote_2128" class="fnanchor">2128</a> nevertheless, if they believe in spiritual
beings, they have the germ of religion.</p>

<p>For M. Reinach<a id="FNanchor_2129" href="#Footnote_2129" class="fnanchor">2129</a> religion was born at the moment when man,
finding himself constrained to do what he feared might offend malignant
spirits, began to devise means of conciliating them. But may
it not be said with equal truth that the birthday of religion was when
man began to form the conception, on which religion, in the ordinary
sense, is based, that spiritual beings exist?</p>

<p>M. Reinach has recently pronounced that ‘fire-worship preceded
the use of fire, just as the worship of cereals preceded and prepared the
way for their cultivation’.<a id="FNanchor_2130" href="#Footnote_2130" class="fnanchor">2130</a> One must infer that the ‘true primitive
savage’, who, according to M. Reinach, was in a state of ‘passive
atheism’, and therefore had not begun to worship fire, had not found
out how to produce it. If M. Reinach is right, the ‘passive atheist’
must have been primitive indeed.</p>

<p>Professor Robertson Smith held that ‘religion in the only true
sense of the word’ began ‘not with a vague fear of unknown powers,
but with a loving reverence for known gods who are knit to their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
worshippers by strong bonds of kinship’.<a id="FNanchor_2131" href="#Footnote_2131" class="fnanchor">2131</a> But it was in the ‘vague
fear’ that the ‘loving reverence’ had its germ.</p>

<p>Dr. J. G. Frazer, in a recent article<a id="FNanchor_2132" href="#Footnote_2132" class="fnanchor">2132</a>, argues that the Australian
aborigines have no religion: but by religion he means ‘a propitiation
or conciliation of the higher powers’;<a id="FNanchor_2133" href="#Footnote_2133" class="fnanchor">2133</a> and he admits that some
Australian tribes ‘have a notion of spiritual beings who can help or
injure them’.<a id="FNanchor_2134" href="#Footnote_2134" class="fnanchor">2134</a> In other words, their belief fulfils Professor Tylor’s
‘minimum definition of religion’; and Professor A. C. Haddon justly
remarks that ‘it is doubtful whether more than a few anthropologists
of repute would deny the term religion to the beliefs and practices of
the Arunta’ of Central Australia.<a id="FNanchor_2135" href="#Footnote_2135" class="fnanchor">2135</a></p>

<h2 id="PII_Pg463">DUMBUCK, LANGBANK, DUNBUIE</h2>

<p>I have said nothing in the first part of this book about the famous
‘crannogs’, or pile-dwellings (so called), which were discovered a
few years ago at Dumbuck and Langbank in the estuary of the Clyde,
the hill-fort of Dunbuie by Dumbarton Castle, and the remarkable
objects which they contained, because it is admitted that they belong
to a period several centuries later than the Roman conquest of
Britain; but, for a reason which will presently be apparent, they
must not be ignored. Everything worth reading that has been
written upon the subject is included in two recent books&mdash;<cite>Archaeology
and False Antiquities</cite>, in which Dr. Robert Munro contends that the
disputed objects are spurious, and the <cite>Clyde Mystery</cite>, in which
Mr. Andrew Lang endeavours to show that the difficulty of regarding
them as forgeries is at least as great as the difficulty of maintaining
their authenticity, and that, if they are genuine, they prove the
survival of ritual and magical ideas that must have belonged to
the Stone Age.</p>

<p>It may be premised that Professor Boyd Dawkins,<a id="FNanchor_2136" href="#Footnote_2136" class="fnanchor">2136</a> after a careful
examination of certain engraved oyster shells, which were a part of
the finds at Dunbuie, reported that he ‘had satisfied himself that
two of the shells were American blue points’, and, as he somewhat
superfluously added, ‘consequently of very modern date.’ Mr. Lang,
admitting this, suggests that, as Dunbuie was left unguarded for
several months, the shells were introduced by some local wag.<a id="FNanchor_2137" href="#Footnote_2137" class="fnanchor">2137</a> At
the same time he argues that if the disputed objects were not genuine,
either the forger must have been a man of extraordinary erudition,
who had studied the archaeology of England, America, France,
Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Australia, or, by a coincidence
which is incredible, he produced objects which are found in all those
countries. I would suggest, however, that he may himself have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
been a person of quite ordinary education, who was either employed
by an archaeologist with a peculiar sense of humour or learned what
was necessary for his purpose from some one more erudite than
himself. Mr. Lang reminds us, further, that if the disputed objects
have been found in Britain only in the basin of the Clyde, certain
painted pebbles, similar to those of Mas d’Azil, which have been
found in Scottish brochs, are also unique in Britain, and yet are
disputed by nobody; and he might have said the same of the strange
objects of Mycenaean type which were found in a barrow on Folkton
Wold.<a id="FNanchor_2138" href="#Footnote_2138" class="fnanchor">2138</a></p>

<p>Dr. Munro, on the other hand, can see no resemblance whatever
between the disputed objects and the genuine productions of Australia
or certain other questionable ‘antiquities’ that recently startled the
explorers of a Portuguese dolmen.<a id="FNanchor_2139" href="#Footnote_2139" class="fnanchor">2139</a> The reader, as Mr. Lang says,
must decide for himself; and I doubt whether he will see eye to eye
with Dr. Munro.</p>

<p>The doctor also insists that if the Scottish objects are survivals,
‘we ought to find, at least somewhere in Britain, decided and undisputed
evidence of the existence of a phase of culture in the Stone Age
in which the prototypes ... would be the prevailing forms in general
use. But,’ he adds, ‘of such archaic remains there is not a vestige.’<a id="FNanchor_2140" href="#Footnote_2140" class="fnanchor">2140</a>
No; but the earth has not yet given up all the vestiges of the Stone
Age: the first discovery of a Scottish interment of the Early Iron
Age has been made within the present century,<a id="FNanchor_2141" href="#Footnote_2141" class="fnanchor">2141</a> and the doctor will
admit that it is probably not unique; besides, do not the brochs and
Folkton Wold suggest an answer to his argument?</p>

<p>Mr. Lang, concluding that at present the only position which the
impartial <i>savant</i> can reasonably assume is a seat upon the proverbial
fence, admits that ‘the very strong point against authenticity is
this: <i>numbers</i> of the disputed objects were found in sites of the early
<i>Iron Age</i>. Now,’ he continues, ‘such objects, save for a few examples,
are only known&mdash;and that in non-British lands&mdash;in <i>Neolithic</i>
sites. The theory of survival may be thought not to cover the
<i>number</i> of the disputed objects.’<a id="FNanchor_2142" href="#Footnote_2142" class="fnanchor">2142</a> May it not also be said that as an
ignorant or sportive forger undoubtedly carved the oyster shells, so
the disputed objects may have been smuggled into the sites by a
forger who was well informed?<a id="FNanchor_2143" href="#Footnote_2143" class="fnanchor">2143</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="PII_Pg465">INHUMATION AND CREMATION</h2>

<p>Dr. R. Munro<a id="FNanchor_2144" href="#Footnote_2144" class="fnanchor">2144</a> says, on what authority I do not know, that the
object of cremation was ‘to liberate the spirit more quickly’. Is it
then to be concluded that in cases where inhumation and cremation
were practised simultaneously in the same barrow,<a id="FNanchor_2145" href="#Footnote_2145" class="fnanchor">2145</a> it was intended
that certain spirits should be liberated quickly and others slowly?</p>

<p>Mr. W. C. Borlase<a id="FNanchor_2146" href="#Footnote_2146" class="fnanchor">2146</a> remarks that ‘the transformation which would
have taken place when incineration was introduced ... would ...
have ... been from a cult which was probably filthy and material to
one which was pure and spiritual’. We have seen that the ‘probably
filthy’ and the ‘spiritual’ cult were practised simultaneously
by the same people; are we to assume that when inhumation
was reintroduced in the Early Iron Age filth and materialism
were revived?</p>

<p>Professor Boyd Dawkins<a id="FNanchor_2147" href="#Footnote_2147" class="fnanchor">2147</a> insists that cremation was introduced
into Britain by ‘the bronze-using Celtic tribes’; and Dr. Munro<a id="FNanchor_2148" href="#Footnote_2148" class="fnanchor">2148</a>
apparently agrees with him. Putting aside the fact that most of
the tribes to which the professor refers were not Celtic,<a id="FNanchor_2149" href="#Footnote_2149" class="fnanchor">2149</a> there is no
evidence that cremation was first introduced by bronze-using tribes:
if it was, the long barrows in which primary cremation interments
have been found must have been erected in the British Bronze Age!
It may or may not be true that, as Canon Greenwell suggests,<a id="FNanchor_2150" href="#Footnote_2150" class="fnanchor">2150</a> some
of the Yorkshire round barrows were erected in the Stone Age; but
at all events they were later than the long barrows of the same county.
Those long barrows, according to Dr. Munro and Professor Boyd
Dawkins, must have been erected after a bronze-using people had
introduced cremation into Britain. How then would the professor
and the doctor explain the fact that in the round barrows of the
Yorkshire Wolds there was a reaction in favour of inhumation, seeing
that Canon Greenwell<a id="FNanchor_2151" href="#Footnote_2151" class="fnanchor">2151</a> found in them 301 interments of unburnt and
only 78 of burnt bones?</p>

<p>Dr. Munro<a id="FNanchor_2152" href="#Footnote_2152" class="fnanchor">2152</a> remarks further that, ‘so far as available evidence has
been adduced, it would appear that the only sepulchral remains,
proved to have been older than the custom of cremation, are the
chambered cairns in the south-west of England. When, however,
the analogous cairns of Argyllshire, Caithness, and the Orkney
Islands were constructed, the religious wave had already enveloped
Northern Britain. Hence, though generally destitute of bronze
relics, these structures were generally contemporary with the Bronze
Age burials elsewhere in Britain.... The explanation ... is that in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
out-of-the-way localities ... the Stone Age civilisation lingered
longer than in those on the main routes of commercial intercourse.’
Certainly; but no sepulchral remains in Britain are ‘<i>proved</i> to have
been older than the custom of cremation’. Inhumation preceded
cremation in Cornwall;<a id="FNanchor_2153" href="#Footnote_2153" class="fnanchor">2153</a> but there is no evidence that when inhumation
was first practised there cremation was not practised in other
parts of Britain. Though cremation was very rare in the chambered
long barrows of Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, it was not unknown:<a id="FNanchor_2154" href="#Footnote_2154" class="fnanchor">2154</a>
it was almost universal in the unchambered long barrows of Yorkshire;
and it cannot be proved that they were later than the chambered
long barrows of Wiltshire and Gloucestershire.<a id="FNanchor_2155" href="#Footnote_2155" class="fnanchor">2155</a> The chambered
cairns of Scotland were not only ‘generally’ but absolutely
‘destitute of bronze relics’. Very likely some of them may have
been erected after the Bronze Age had commenced in Southern
Britain; but even this can hardly be proved. What has been proved
is that even in the Palaeolithic Age in the caves near Mentone cremation
was already practised side by side with inhumation.<a id="FNanchor_2156" href="#Footnote_2156" class="fnanchor">2156</a></p>

<p>[Since the rough draft of this note was written Professor Boyd
Dawkins<a id="FNanchor_2157" href="#Footnote_2157" class="fnanchor">2157</a> has asserted that the long chambered barrow of Stoney
Littleton belonged to the Bronze Age, while he admits, apparently
because it did not contain cremated interments, that the long chambered
barrow of Rodmarton was neolithic.<a id="FNanchor_2158" href="#Footnote_2158" class="fnanchor">2158</a>]</p>

<p>Professor Ridgeway’s views, which are expounded in his well-known
chapter, ‘Cremation, Inhumation, and the Soul,’ have been
noticed in the first part of this book. In regard to Western usage
he blunders in a way which makes me hesitate to accept his statements
about archaeological details that I have not myself studied.
He says that ‘in Dorsetshire ... the extended position seems to be
the prevalent one’,<a id="FNanchor_2159" href="#Footnote_2159" class="fnanchor">2159</a> a remark which I have already noted<a id="FNanchor_2160" href="#Footnote_2160" class="fnanchor">2160</a> as an
instance of the danger of relying upon second-hand evidence; he
implies that the invaders who ‘conquered Dorset, Wiltshire, and
Cornwall’ in the Bronze Age were Belgae;<a id="FNanchor_2161" href="#Footnote_2161" class="fnanchor">2161</a> and he states that ‘in
France inhumation was universal before the age of metal’,<a id="FNanchor_2162" href="#Footnote_2162" class="fnanchor">2162</a> which,
as I have shown,<a id="FNanchor_2163" href="#Footnote_2163" class="fnanchor">2163</a> is contrary to fact.

<h2 id="PII_Pg467">SEPULCHRAL POTTERY</h2>

<p>Some antiquaries have maintained that drinking-cups, food-vessels,
incense-cups, and urns were not specially made for sepulchral purposes,
but were merely ordinary domestic vessels.<a id="FNanchor_2164" href="#Footnote_2164" class="fnanchor">2164</a> On the other
hand, it has been urged that most of them were too fragile to stand
rough usage; that many are so contracted at the bottom that they
would have been ill adapted to serve as table or culinary ware; that
the food-vessels and the drinking-cups were too porous to hold fluid
long, while the shape of most of them would have made them inconvenient
for any ordinary purpose; and that all are wholly unlike
the domestic pottery which has actually been found in hut-circles,
forts, barrows, and the Heathery Burn Cave.<a id="FNanchor_2165" href="#Footnote_2165" class="fnanchor">2165</a> Mr. J. R. Mortimer<a id="FNanchor_2166" href="#Footnote_2166" class="fnanchor">2166</a>
replies that drinking-cups and food-vessels were quite strong enough
for domestic use; that ‘the form of the typical drinking-cup is well
chosen for the purpose its name implies, and most of the food-vessels
are the prototypes of our ... porringers, jars’, &amp;c. It may be
admitted that some few food-vessels, for instance the one figured by
Thurnam in <cite>Archaeologia</cite>, xliii, 381, are, apart from their decoration,
not unlike domestic bowls; but what about incense-cups? The
truth perhaps lies between the opposing views; for drinking-cups
and food-vessels have been exhumed from pit-dwellings near Taplow;<a id="FNanchor_2167" href="#Footnote_2167" class="fnanchor">2167</a>
and Pitt-Rivers,<a id="FNanchor_2168" href="#Footnote_2168" class="fnanchor">2168</a> speaking of an urn which was found on the bottom
of the ditch of the camp in South Lodge Park in his estate, observes
that ‘it is more probable that the urn would be found in the ditch
thrown away as refuse if it was in ordinary use, than if it were only
fabricated for ceremonial purposes’. He remarks further that ‘the
large quantities of pottery of the same quality ... afterwards found
in different parts of the Camp, confirms this opinion [that sepulchral
pottery was used for domestic purposes], as it could not all have been
used for funeral urns’.<a id="FNanchor_2169" href="#Footnote_2169" class="fnanchor">2169</a> Moreover, fragments of ornamental pottery
of the drinking-cup type were found by Pitt-Rivers in a pit in
Martin Down Camp.<a id="FNanchor_2170" href="#Footnote_2170" class="fnanchor">2170</a> Still, the fact remains that only a very small
proportion of the pottery which is commonly called sepulchral has
been found outside sepulchres; and even it may have been intended
for sepulchral use.

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="PII_Pg468">STONEHENGE</h2>

<p>Stonehenge has exercised the minds of many generations of antiquaries.
An exhaustive bibliography, filling 169 pages and containing
the titles of 947 books and articles, was published in the
<cite>Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine</cite> for 1901: but
nearly all the works therein enumerated are obsolete; and any one
who wishes to form an independent judgement will find all the
necessary materials in the volumes which will be referred to in this
article.</p>

<p>I. Modern opinion has for some time been tending to the conclusion
that Stonehenge was erected, or at least began to be erected, in the
Bronze Age. Excavation has proved that it did not exist before
the use of copper or bronze, however uncommon it may have been,
was known in this country;<a id="FNanchor_2171" href="#Footnote_2171" class="fnanchor">2171</a> and the arguments of Rickman,<a id="FNanchor_2172" href="#Footnote_2172" class="fnanchor">2172</a> James
Fergusson,<a id="FNanchor_2173" href="#Footnote_2173" class="fnanchor">2173</a> and others who contend for a Roman or post-Roman date
have been or can be demolished. To refute them in the text of this
article would be useless; for no competent archaeologist now regards
them as worth discussion.<a id="FNanchor_2174" href="#Footnote_2174" class="fnanchor">2174</a></p>

<p>Dr. Arthur Evans maintains that Stonehenge was built in the
earlier half of the third century before Christ, although some parts of
it may be of later date; that ‘sun worship was at most a secondary
object in its structure’; and that it was ‘one of a large series of
primitive religious monuments that grew out of purely sepulchral
architecture’. Let us first consider the question of date.</p>

<p>Dr. Evans has no difficulty in establishing, what has already been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
demonstrated in Part I of this book,<a id="FNanchor_2175" href="#Footnote_2175" class="fnanchor">2175</a> that ‘Stonehenge was at least
begun before the close of the Wiltshire “Round-Barrow” Period’.<a id="FNanchor_2176" href="#Footnote_2176" class="fnanchor">2176</a>
At the same time he holds that ‘its foundation belongs to the
conclusion of this period’. He points out that ‘of 36 disk-shaped
barrows [in the neighbourhood of Stonehenge] 35 contained
cremation interments.... The number of glass beads contained in
these barrows is also,’ he continues, ‘evidence of their comparatively
late date<a id="FNanchor_2177" href="#Footnote_2177" class="fnanchor">2177</a>.... The general inference which we draw from the
intimate structural connexion between Stonehenge and these disk-shaped
barrows is, that the great stone circles themselves were erected
towards the close of the Round-Barrow Period. The proportionately
frequent occurrence of gold relics in barrows in the immediate neighbourhood
of Stonehenge, 4 out of 5 such discoveries having
been made within half-a-mile of this monument, points in the same
direction.’ And if it should be argued that the barrows may have
been built after the erection of Stonehenge, his answer would be that
‘the barrows themselves, with the exception of the two within its
own area, are disposed without any reference to Stonehenge, and do
not in any way cluster about it, as we might reasonably have expected
them to do had the bulk of them been reared after the Stone Circle’.
Dr. Evans then observes that an amber collar ‘found in one of the
Lake barrows about two miles from Stonehenge ... is of a form and
arrangement identical with the amber necklaces found in the great
cemetery at Hallstatt, and from the similar character of the boring
of the beads must in all probability have come from the same centre
of manufacture’; and he endeavours to show that we may infer
from recent discoveries that ‘a large proportion of the Hallstatt
remains reach down to the period between the approximate dates of
450-300 <small>B.C.</small>’<a id="FNanchor_2178" href="#Footnote_2178" class="fnanchor">2178</a> On the other hand, Late Celtic antiquities, which
began to appear in Britain ‘at least as early as the second century
<small>B.C.</small>’, are absent from the barrows of Wiltshire; and the latest date
which can be assigned to these barrows is about 250 <small>B.C.</small> Dr. Evans
concludes that ‘we may approximately refer the foundation of
Stonehenge to the end of the fourth or beginning of the third
century’.<a id="FNanchor_2179" href="#Footnote_2179" class="fnanchor">2179</a></p>

<p>Some of these arguments do not appear to have much weight.
Dr. Evans himself admits that there is a great structural distinction
between Stonehenge and the disk-shaped barrows:<a id="FNanchor_2180" href="#Footnote_2180" class="fnanchor">2180</a> in the latter the
surrounding ditch is <i>inside</i> the bank; in the Stonehenge vallum it
is <i>outside</i>. Those barrows at all events in which chippings of the
stones were found were later than Stonehenge;<a id="FNanchor_2181" href="#Footnote_2181" class="fnanchor">2181</a> and whatever conclusion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
may be drawn from the arrangement of the barrows, their
number is so great as to suggest the inference that many of them
were erected there because Stonehenge was regarded as a holy place.
In a recent article,<a id="FNanchor_2182" href="#Footnote_2182" class="fnanchor">2182</a> however, Dr. Evans has reinforced his argument,
pointing out that the circle called the Rollright Stones, which stands
on a hill overlooking the valley of the Warwickshire Stour, also
stands ‘in immediate relation to a large group of [disk-shaped]
sepulchral barrows’, and giving additional and conclusive evidence
as to the late date of these particular monuments. He would not,
however, I believe, now assign to Stonehenge quite so early a date as
the ‘beginning of the third century’; for the commencement of
our Early Iron Age is commonly referred to about 400 <small>B.C.</small><a id="FNanchor_2183" href="#Footnote_2183" class="fnanchor">2183</a> Of the
two barrows in which Hoare found chippings of the Stonehenge
stones one was bell-shaped,<a id="FNanchor_2184" href="#Footnote_2184" class="fnanchor">2184</a> the other belonged to the kind which he
called ‘flat’,<a id="FNanchor_2185" href="#Footnote_2185" class="fnanchor">2185</a> but which, as Thurnam points out,<a id="FNanchor_2186" href="#Footnote_2186" class="fnanchor">2186</a> is simply a variety
of the bowl-barrow; but Thurnam has given reasons for believing
that many barrows of this form may not have been earlier than
disk-shaped mounds.<a id="FNanchor_2187" href="#Footnote_2187" class="fnanchor">2187</a></p>

<p>In 1901 excavations were made at Stonehenge, but only in ‘a
fraction of the whole site’, under the superintendence of Professor
W. Gowland.<a id="FNanchor_2188" href="#Footnote_2188" class="fnanchor">2188</a> The principal objects discovered were chippings from
the ‘sarsens’ and ‘blue-stones’; more than one hundred stone
implements, many of which were of flint, and had evidently been
used for dressing the softer stones of the monument, while others
consisted of ‘the hard quartzite variety of sarsen’; bones of
domestic animals; ‘splinters of antlers of deer’; ‘a portion of a
large antler with its lowest tine worn away,’ apparently from its
having been used as a pick; and Roman coins, which, however, were
only found in the superficial layers.<a id="FNanchor_2189" href="#Footnote_2189" class="fnanchor">2189</a> ‘The layers of the excavations,’
says Professor Gowland, ‘in which the flint and stone tools were
found was absolutely undisturbed ground’;<a id="FNanchor_2190" href="#Footnote_2190" class="fnanchor">2190</a> and the chippings were
found as far down as the surface of the bed rock. Only one trace of
copper or bronze was visible, namely a stain, described by the
formula CuCO₃ on a sarsen block, seven feet below the surface. The
work of trimming the stones appears to have been done with stone
implements only. The copper stain, however, proves that copper or
bronze must have been in use at the time when the builders of Stonehenge
were at work. Professor Gowland<a id="FNanchor_2191" href="#Footnote_2191" class="fnanchor">2191</a> affirms that the stain
‘can only have been produced by prolonged contact with some very
small object of copper or bronze or some material containing copper....
It may perhaps have been an ornament, but cannot possibly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
have been an implement.’ He argues, further, that ‘even if metal
tools were of no use for this particular work, it is difficult to believe
that, if the monument were of the Bronze Age, no bronze implement
would have been lost in the course of its erection’.<a id="FNanchor_2192" href="#Footnote_2192" class="fnanchor">2192</a> I, on the other
hand, would remind him that no bronze has been found in the hut-circles
of Dartmoor or in various cemeteries which undoubtedly
belonged to the Bronze Age,<a id="FNanchor_2193" href="#Footnote_2193" class="fnanchor">2193</a> and I suggest that if the workmen who
built Stonehenge had no use for bronze tools when they were building
it, they were not more likely to lose them on the site than the masons
who built St. Paul’s Cathedral to drop their table knives within the
area of the churchyard. However, Professor Gowland does not pin
his faith upon this argument. He points out<a id="FNanchor_2194" href="#Footnote_2194" class="fnanchor">2194</a> that many of the flint
implements which he discovered at Stonehenge closely resemble
those which were discovered by Canon Greenwell at Grime’s Graves,
and which were attributed by him to the close of the Neolithic Age, or,
at the latest, to a period when bronze had not come into general use.<a id="FNanchor_2195" href="#Footnote_2195" class="fnanchor">2195</a>
But nobody who has learned the ABC of archaeology needs to be
told that stone implements were used long after the introduction of
bronze;<a id="FNanchor_2196" href="#Footnote_2196" class="fnanchor">2196</a> and no expert sees anything improbable in the theory that
such tools were used in constructing Stonehenge towards the end of
the Bronze Age. Besides, as Professor Gowland admits, Dr. Maskelyne
has pointed out that ‘bronze tools would not work sarsens’;<a id="FNanchor_2197" href="#Footnote_2197" class="fnanchor">2197</a>
assuming, then, that Stonehenge was erected in the Bronze Age, how
could the sarsens have been dressed except with implements of stone?
But the discovery upon which Professor Gowland lays the most
stress is that of the deer-horn pick. Similar picks were found in
large numbers at Grime’s Graves. The one which Professor Gowland
found, if it really was a pick, must have been used for excavating
the pits in which the stones of Stonehenge were erected; and Professor
Gowland argues that if bronze tools had been in use at the
time, ‘it would seem not unreasonable to assume that they would
have been employed, as they would have been so much more effective
for such work than the picks of deer’s horn.’<a id="FNanchor_2198" href="#Footnote_2198" class="fnanchor">2198</a> But no bronze pick
has ever been found in this country; and deer-horn picks have been
found in interments of the Bronze Age,<a id="FNanchor_2199" href="#Footnote_2199" class="fnanchor">2199</a> and even in a Romano-British
deposit in the village of Woodyates on Cranborne Chase.<a id="FNanchor_2200" href="#Footnote_2200" class="fnanchor">2200</a>
Professor Gowland provisionally assigns the date ‘about 2000-1800
<small>B.C</small>.’ for the erection of Stonehenge; and he adds that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
Sir Norman Lockyer’s astronomical calculation ‘gives an approximate
date ... of 1680 <small>B.C.</small>, with a margin of error ± 200 years’.</p>

<p>More than one attempt has been made to determine the date of
Stonehenge from the orientation of its axis; and these attempts
have been founded upon the assumption that one, at all events, of
the objects which the builders had in view was the worship of the
sun. ‘The chief evidence,’ as Sir Norman Lockyer and the late
Mr. F. C. Penrose have observed, ‘lies in the fact that an “avenue”
... formed by two ancient earthen banks, extends for a considerable
distance from the structure, in the general direction of the sunrise
at the summer solstice.’<a id="FNanchor_2201" href="#Footnote_2201" class="fnanchor">2201</a> On the avenue, 100 feet from the so-called
Slaughter Stone, stands a large monolith, called the ‘Friar’s Heel’,
or the ‘Heel Stone’. At one time it was generally assumed that
on Midsummer Day, at the time when Stonehenge was built, an
observer, standing on or behind the ‘Altar Stone’, could see the
sun rising above the tip of the Heel Stone. At the present time, however,
as Mr. Arthur Hinks points out, ‘the sun rises further south
than it has done for the last ten thousand years’; and yet, from the
point of view of an observer standing behind the Altar Stone, ‘it still
rises north of the stone.’<a id="FNanchor_2202" href="#Footnote_2202" class="fnanchor">2202</a> In fact ‘it is some seven days before or
after midsummer day when it rises directly over the stone’.<a id="FNanchor_2203" href="#Footnote_2203" class="fnanchor">2203</a> Moreover,
as Professor Flinders Petrie<a id="FNanchor_2204" href="#Footnote_2204" class="fnanchor">2204</a> says, the ‘skew position’ of the
Altar Stone would seem to show that it is not now in its original
position. Accordingly Sir Norman Lockyer felt obliged to leave
the Friar’s Heel out of his calculations, and to confine himself to
attempting to determine the orientation of the avenue.<a id="FNanchor_2205" href="#Footnote_2205" class="fnanchor">2205</a> The method
which he and his colleague adopted was to peg out as accurately as
possible ‘the central line between the low and often mutilated banks’
of the avenue, and then to measure ‘the bearings of two sections of
this line near the beginning and the end’.<a id="FNanchor_2206" href="#Footnote_2206" class="fnanchor">2206</a> ‘The resulting observations,’
he tells us, ‘gave for the axis of the avenue nearest the commencement
an azimuth of 49° 38′ 48″, and for that of the more distant
49° 32′ 54″.’<a id="FNanchor_2207" href="#Footnote_2207" class="fnanchor">2207</a> But neither of these measurements was adopted
by Sir Norman. He found, or thought that he found, that the mean
between the two values which he had obtained, namely, 49° 35′ 51″,
was ‘confirmed by the information, supplied by the Ordnance
Survey, that from the centre of the temple [Stonehenge] the bearing
of the principal bench mark on the ancient fortified hill, about eight
miles distant, a well-known British encampment named ... Sidbury,
is 49° 34′ 18″; and that the same line continued through Stonehenge
to the south-west strikes another ancient fortification, namely,
Grovely Castle, about six miles distant, and at practically the same
azimuth, viz., 49° 35′ 51″. For the above reasons,’ he says,
‘49° 34′ 18″ has been adopted for the azimuth of the avenue.’<a id="FNanchor_2208" href="#Footnote_2208" class="fnanchor">2208</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
Having regard to the rate of change in the obliquity of the ecliptic,<a id="FNanchor_2209" href="#Footnote_2209" class="fnanchor">2209</a>
he concluded that the date of the foundation of Stonehenge was
1680 <small>B.C.</small>; but he admits that this date ‘may possibly be in error
by ±200 years’.<a id="FNanchor_2210" href="#Footnote_2210" class="fnanchor">2210</a></p>

<p>It would appear then that, if Sir Norman Lockyer’s calculations
are well founded, Stonehenge was erected at some time between 1880
and 1480 <small>B.C.</small> Certainly the conclusion does not err on the side of
excessive precision. But the foundation upon which the calculations
rest has been shown by Mr. Hinks to be rotten. To begin with,
the assumption that Sidbury Hill was connected with the erection
of Stonehenge is absurd. Does Sir Norman Lockyer mean to suggest
that the bench mark was prehistoric? ‘In our climate,’ says
Mr. Hinks, ‘Sidbury is probably not visible from Stonehenge at
sunrise once in twenty years.’<a id="FNanchor_2211" href="#Footnote_2211" class="fnanchor">2211</a> In point of fact it is never so visible:
only the trees on the top of the hill are to be seen. Furthermore,
as Mr. Hinks points out, Sir Norman Lockyer has assumed that ‘for
[the temple of] Karnak the moment of sunset was when the sun’s
centre had just reached the horizon; for Stonehenge sunrise was the
moment when the first tip of the sun appeared above the hill. It
was necessary to adopt these precise yet different phases for the two
cases, because any other assumptions would have led to results
obviously absurd.’<a id="FNanchor_2212" href="#Footnote_2212" class="fnanchor">2212</a> Finally, Sir Norman Lockyer is obliged to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
assume that the builders of Stonehenge could tell the exact day on
which the midsummer solstice occurred. The utter improbability
of this assumption must be apparent to any one who remembers that
the astronomer who constructed the Julian calendar miscalculated
the dates both of the summer and of the winter solstice.<a id="FNanchor_2213" href="#Footnote_2213" class="fnanchor">2213</a></p>

<p>Mr. E. J. Webb, whose brilliant article in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>
of October, 1894, demolished Sir Norman Lockyer’s theory as to the
orientation of the Egyptian temples,<a id="FNanchor_2214" href="#Footnote_2214" class="fnanchor">2214</a> has written me a letter in
which the futility of attempting to determine the date of Stonehenge
by astronomical reasoning is explained with a clearness which leaves
nothing to be desired. ‘As,’ he writes, ‘the sun in our latitudes
does not rise at right angles to the horizon, but with a considerable
slant, it follows that the place where his upper rim begins to appear
is appreciably further towards the north than the place where his
centre appears, and this again than the place where he is first seen
fully risen,&mdash;that is, where his lower edge touches the horizon.’
Now I think myself that, even if we could credit the builders with
complete accuracy, attempts to get the date of the building astronomically
would be vain, because (1) we do not know the exact place
(if such there was) at which the observer’s eye was supposed to be
placed. (Flinders Petrie does to some extent get over this difficulty
by supposing that the observer took up a position from which the
point of the Heel Stone appears exactly level with the horizon.
I doubt, however, whether we have a right to be sure that the point
is exactly where it was at first. Some of the stones have leaned over
considerably, and why not this? But the difficulty is much greater
for Lockyer, who takes no account of the Heel Stone.) (2) We do
not know whether the ancients would have understood by the moment
of sunrise the moment when the sun’s upper rim appears (<i>A</i>), or the
moment when his centre appears (<i>B</i>), or the moment when his lower
rim appears (<i>C</i>). (3) Even if we did know this, yet, as every one who
has watched the sun rise must admit, it is practically quite impossible
to be certain when any one of these moments occurs. Lockyer
tacitly admits this when he arbitrarily takes as the moment of first
appearance the time when 2′ (about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub>) of the sun’s disc are risen.</p>

<p>‘It is clear that (<i>A</i> being assumed) when Stonehenge was built, an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
observer looking along Flinders Petrie’s line of sight would see the
Friar’s Heel considerably to the south of the place of sunrise, inasmuch
as, though that place has ever since been moving southwards,
we see it slightly to the south even now. Lockyer therefore puts the
Friar’s Heel out of his theory altogether, in the belief that a stone
which did not exactly mark the place of the most northerly sunrise
could be of no use. I think, on the other hand, that a stone placed
a little too far south would probably suit what is likely to have been
the purpose in view even better than one which exactly marked the
solstitial sunrise. For if, instead of asserting that Stonehenge was
roofed over, and a beam of light admitted at the moment of sunrise
to its darkened sanctuary<a id="FNanchor_2215" href="#Footnote_2215" class="fnanchor">2215</a>&mdash;all of which is pure guesswork&mdash;we
suppose that the builders were contemplating merely such bonfires
and rejoicings as, by Lockyer’s own admission, certainly have taken
place in various parts of the world, may we not ask how people in
those ancient days knew when these festivities were to be held. For
the later days, of which we have knowledge, the answer is easy
enough: then people had the Julian calendar, according to which
St. John’s Day, or whatever day was selected, always recurred at the
same place in the solar year, whether at, or before, or after the
solstice. But we do not know whether in pre-Roman times the
inhabitants of Wiltshire had any settled calendar at all; and if they
had, it is probable that, as in almost all ancient calendars, the days
of the month, and therefore most likely the festivals, were reckoned
by the moon.<a id="FNanchor_2216" href="#Footnote_2216" class="fnanchor">2216</a> The fifteenth, let us say, of a particular month meant
the day when a particular moon was fifteen days old; and if this
day should coincide in one year with the solstice, it would not coincide
with it the next year, and could not have coincided with it the year
before. How then could people tell when the Midsummer festival
ought to be held? I answer that they might have very easily done
so some time beforehand by the aid of a stone set up so as to mark,
not the solstitial sunrise itself, but an earlier&mdash;and therefore of course
also a later&mdash;one. If the Friar’s Heel stood, as on Lockyer’s theory it
did, some little way to the south of the place of the midsummer sunrise,
then the sun must have risen over it twice&mdash;first towards the
end of his journey north, just before the solstice, and secondly on his
return southward, just after the solstice. Now if the Stonehenge
people looked out for the morning on which the sun first seemed to
rise over the stone, and counted the days to a morning when he seemed
to rise there again on his return journey, they could, by halving this
number, obtain the time of the solstice with as much accuracy as
they could have required. After doing this once, they could in
following years always know, by watching the sun’s first approach
to the Friar’s Heel, for what day to appoint the midsummer rejoicings.
That these rejoicings took place at sunrise I do not assert. Bonfires,
at least in these times, usually take place at night.... I do not think
we have any right to say with certainty that any solstitial festival
ever took place at Stonehenge or near it. For even granting that,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
as seems not unlikely, Stonehenge was orientated more or less closely
to the solstitial sunrise, and that the Friar’s Heel was really used
for the observation of the sun, it does not follow that Stonehenge
was a “solar temple” any more than Milan Cathedral, which is
orientated more or less closely to the equinoctial sunset, and has had
a meridian line traced upon its pavement. And even if we knew
that it was a solar temple, we should have no right to infer what kind
of worship went on there.’<a id="FNanchor_2217" href="#Footnote_2217" class="fnanchor">2217</a></p>

<p>Although Dr. Evans’s arguments are not all equally strong,
there can be little doubt that his view as to the date of the erection
of Stonehenge is approximately correct. The stones were certainly
not standing when round barrows were first erected on Salisbury
Plain; for one is contained within the <i>vallum</i>, which, moreover,
encroaches upon another.<a id="FNanchor_2218" href="#Footnote_2218" class="fnanchor">2218</a> Mr. F. R. Coles has shown that ‘so far
as direct evidence has been obtained by rightly conducted excavations,
the outstanding feature of all the Scottish circles that have
been investigated is the presence within them of interments of the
Bronze Age’.<a id="FNanchor_2219" href="#Footnote_2219" class="fnanchor">2219</a> That Stonehenge was erected before the close of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
this period, or at all events before the dawn of the Iron Age in
Wiltshire, is certain; and, as it was the most elaborate and highly
finished of all the stone circles of Great Britain, we may fairly infer
that it was one of the latest of them all.</p>

<p>II. The most interesting pages of Dr. Evans’s article are those
in which he attempts to trace the pedigree, so to speak, of Stonehenge,
and to divine the purpose of its builders. He cites instances
to show that ‘wherever the meaning of these great stone monuments
has been clearly revealed to us, we find them connected either
directly or indirectly with sepulchral usage’.<a id="FNanchor_2220" href="#Footnote_2220" class="fnanchor">2220</a> He contends that
in the most characteristic examples ‘the Circle is an enlarged version
of the ring of stones placed round the grave-mound; the
Dolmen represents the cist within it; the Avenue is merely the
continuation of the underground gallery, which in our earliest
barrows leads to the sepulchral chamber’.<a id="FNanchor_2221" href="#Footnote_2221" class="fnanchor">2221</a> But is there any evidence
that interments ever did take place within the precincts of Stonehenge?
General Pitt-Rivers remarked that the question could be
definitely settled by excavation;<a id="FNanchor_2222" href="#Footnote_2222" class="fnanchor">2222</a> but scientific excavation, as we
have seen, has hitherto been confined within a small area. The
evidence amounts to this:&mdash;a vessel, which Dr. Evans calls an
incense-cup, was discovered by Inigo Jones,<a id="FNanchor_2223" href="#Footnote_2223" class="fnanchor">2223</a> and incense-cups have
never been found except in association with interments;<a id="FNanchor_2224" href="#Footnote_2224" class="fnanchor">2224</a> while the
numerous bones of domestic animals which have been exhumed, along
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
with charcoal and fragments of pottery, from the interior circle,<a id="FNanchor_2225" href="#Footnote_2225" class="fnanchor">2225</a>
point to the conclusion that Stonehenge was the scene of sepulchral
rites such as we know to have been performed in barrows.<a id="FNanchor_2226" href="#Footnote_2226" class="fnanchor">2226</a> Furthermore,
the older monument of Avebury contains two smaller stone
circles, within each of which are the remains of a stone chamber,
which, Dr. Evans argues, ‘there can be little doubt once contained
interments.’<a id="FNanchor_2227" href="#Footnote_2227" class="fnanchor">2227</a> But Dr. Evans is at no great pains to argue that
Stonehenge was itself a cemetery: it is on its connexion, close or
distant, with sepulchral usage that he lays stress. While he points
out that ‘in the case of the Chambered Barrows the [surrounding]
stones may be said still to fulfil an original structural function’,
he holds that ‘in the case of the Circles they bear a more purely
ritual signification. In some cases,’ he adds, ‘we find transitional
examples in which the stone circle is actually seen in the act as it
were of separating itself from the earth barrows. Thus in the great
monument of New Grange [in Ireland] the stone circle is separated
by an interval of some twenty feet from the central mound.’ Then,
going to the Far East for an illustration, he tells us that, while the
stone circles and dolmens which are still erected by the Khasis of
Assam ‘are in themselves non-sepulchral’, they ‘are reared as
a propitiation either to the departed Spirits of their own ancestors
or to any other Spirit’.<a id="FNanchor_2228" href="#Footnote_2228" class="fnanchor">2228</a> But Dr. Evans does not deny that
Stonehenge was also a solar temple: he admits, indeed, that
its orientation ‘certainly seems to associate the Sun in the
religion of the spot’.<a id="FNanchor_2229" href="#Footnote_2229" class="fnanchor">2229</a> This theory is supported by observations
made by Professor Gowland in Japan. ‘There,’ he tells us, ‘on the
seashore at Futa-mi-gaura ... the orientation of the shrine of
adoration is given by two gigantic rocks which rise from the sea as
natural pillars. The sun, as it rises over the mountains of the
distant shore, is observed between them, and the customary prayers
and adorations made ... the point from which the sun is revered
is marked by a structure of the form of a trilithon,’<a id="FNanchor_2230" href="#Footnote_2230" class="fnanchor">2230</a> &amp;c.</p>

<p>But although some evidence has been collected in support of the
theory that certain stone circles in the British Isles and elsewhere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
were orientated more or less closely to the Midsummer sunrise, it does
not necessarily follow that they were solar temples;<a id="FNanchor_2231" href="#Footnote_2231" class="fnanchor">2231</a> and a scientifically
conducted examination of the circles of Kincardineshire and
Aberdeenshire has shown that their main diameters ‘are in scarcely
any instance oriented (<i>sic</i>) to any point of the compass as we understand
the term’;<a id="FNanchor_2232" href="#Footnote_2232" class="fnanchor">2232</a> while Mr. W. C. Lukis, pointing out that on
Dartmoor and in Cornwall circles are to be found in clusters, and
that there are three circles quite close to one another at Stanton
Drew, asks, ‘if they were temples, why should the worshippers
have been gathered into separate congregations?’<a id="FNanchor_2233" href="#Footnote_2233" class="fnanchor">2233</a> The only answer
which I can suggest is that while each of these circles was probably
erected either for sepulchral purposes or in honour of a dead ancestor,
the rites which were from time to time solemnized within them may
have been connected with the worship of the sun. There is no
reason to believe that in any megalithic circle in the British Isles
solar worship was more than incidental.</p>

<p>About forty years ago the late distinguished archaeologist,
Professor Nilsson, wrote an article,<a id="FNanchor_2234" href="#Footnote_2234" class="fnanchor">2234</a> the main object of which was
to prove that Stonehenge was a temple of Phoenician origin, consecrated
to the worship of Baal; but the evidence upon which he
relied was so unsubstantial that no useful purpose would be served
by summarizing his arguments, which, indeed, are virtually obsolete.</p>

<p>Professor Flinders Petrie<a id="FNanchor_2235" href="#Footnote_2235" class="fnanchor">2235</a> argues that certain parts of Stonehenge
are much later than others; and Dr. Evans, who agrees with him,
remarks that ‘this is strongly shown by the fact that each of the
Stone Circles as well as the Earth Circle has a different centre’.<a id="FNanchor_2236" href="#Footnote_2236" class="fnanchor">2236</a>
Dr. Evans also points out that, in the case of the circles which are
still erected in the East, ‘the huge blocks are not all put up at one
time but in batches of an equal number of stones at intervals of time.’</p>

<p>Professor Gowland has shown that the sarsen stones in the outer
circle must have been erected before the trilithons, and the trilithons
before the blue-stones.<a id="FNanchor_2237" href="#Footnote_2237" class="fnanchor">2237</a> ‘That the stones,’ he remarks, ‘of the
central trilithon were erected from the inside of the circle has been
conclusively demonstrated by the excavations; hence the “blue-stones”
in front cannot have been erected before them. Moreover,
the “bluestone”, No. 68, the base of which was laid bare in
Excavation V, was found to be set in the rubble which had been
used to fill up the foundation of No. 56, and further, in a lower
layer than its base, there were two ... blocks of sarsen with tooled
surfaces.... If [the outer sarsens were set up] from the inside [of
the circle], their erection must have preceded that of the trilithons
and hence of the “bluestones”. On the other hand, should the outer
sarsens have been reared from the outside, it would not be possible
for the “bluestones” to have been placed in position before them,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
as they would then have seriously interfered with, if not altogether
prevented the erecting operations.’ Mr. William Cunnington,
however, observes that ‘the fact that specimens of all the varieties
of rocks which constitute the inner circle of Stonehenge have been
found in the mixed substance at the base of ... [the stump of one of
the blue-stones] proves that they were all on the spot when the
inner ellipse was erected’;<a id="FNanchor_2238" href="#Footnote_2238" class="fnanchor">2238</a> and Professor Gowland, who confirms
this view, concludes that ‘no long interval of time separated the
erection of the sarsen and the “bluestone” monoliths, although the
work must have occupied a considerable period’.</p>

<p>III. Unwarned by the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> and Mr. Hinks, Sir
Norman Lockyer published in <cite>Nature</cite><a id="FNanchor_2239" href="#Footnote_2239" class="fnanchor">2239</a> a series of ‘Notes on Stonehenge’,
which might be safely ignored if his authority had not
made converts, even among archaeologists and men of science who
happen to be ignorant of certain essential facts. He now maintains
that the sarsens ‘and above all the trilithons of the magnificent
naos represent a re-dedication and a re-construction of a much
older temple’; and, further, that ‘the older temple dealt, primarily
but not exclusively, with the May year’, while ‘the newer temple
represented a change of cult, and was dedicated primarily to the
solstitial year’. It is unnecessary to examine in detail the process
by which he has endeavoured to establish these conclusions; but
I shall give a few specimens of his work.</p>

<p>‘Acting,’ says Sir Norman, ‘on a very old tradition, the people
from Salisbury and other surrounding places go to observe the
sunrise on the longest day of the year at Stonehenge. We therefore,’
he concludes, ‘are perfectly justified in assuming that it was
a solar temple.’<a id="FNanchor_2240" href="#Footnote_2240" class="fnanchor">2240</a> Not improbably it was&mdash;from one point of view;
but how old is the tradition? The earliest extant mention of
Stonehenge is in the <cite>Historia Anglorum</cite><a id="FNanchor_2241" href="#Footnote_2241" class="fnanchor">2241</a> of Henry of Huntingdon,
who lived in the twelfth century, but who does not refer to the
tradition. Stonehenge, according to Sir Norman Lockyer, was
rebuilt in 1680 <small>B.C.</small> It is therefore impossible to prove that the
tradition originated even as early as two thousand nine hundred
years after the alleged date of the alleged second dedication of
Stonehenge. Tentatively I would suggest that it may have arisen
after 1771, when the astronomical theory was anticipated by a
Dr. John Smith.<a id="FNanchor_2242" href="#Footnote_2242" class="fnanchor">2242</a></p>

<p>Among the ‘considerations’ to which Sir Norman would ‘direct
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
attention’ in support of his theory the fifth<a id="FNanchor_2243" href="#Footnote_2243" class="fnanchor">2243</a> runs as follows:&mdash;‘It
is quite possible that the rebuilding of the temple in 1680 <small>B.C.</small> was
part of a very large general plan which could only have been undertaken
by a large, powerful and comparatively civilized tribe or
people under strict government, commanding the services of skilled
mathematicians, for Stonehenge, Old Sarum, and Grovely Castle
occupy the points of an equilateral triangle of <i>exactly</i> six miles in
the sides, and the three sides are continuations of the entrances at
Stonehenge and Old Sarum and of a ditch running through the centre
of Grovely Castle, and the line Stonehenge&mdash;Old Sarum passes
<i>exactly</i> through Salisbury Spire, which again is exactly two miles
from Sarum. We ought to restore the old name, Solisbury.’</p>

<p>‘Skilled mathematicians’ on Salisbury Plain in 1680 <small>B.C.</small>, a
thousand years before the dawn of mathematics in Greece,<a id="FNanchor_2244" href="#Footnote_2244" class="fnanchor">2244</a> busily
engaged in forming, for some recondite religious purpose, gigantic
equilateral triangles! Sir Norman italicized the word ‘exactly’.
Evidently then he wished to impress upon us, in proof of the mathematicians’
skill, not only that they made their triangle equilateral,
but that each side measured six miles,&mdash;no more and no less. Is it
not a remarkable coincidence that the unit of measurement in the
British Bronze Age was the English statute mile? I confess that
I cannot grasp the significance of the prolongation of ‘the line
Stonehenge&mdash;Old Sarum’ to Salisbury Spire, or of the fact that this
additional section was ‘exactly two miles long’, unless the builders
of Stonehenge were Christians as well as mathematicians and Salisbury
Spire was standing in 1680 <small>B.C.</small> Nor indeed, it should seem,
can Sir Norman himself: at all events in <i>Stonehenge and other
British Monuments Astronomically considered</i>&mdash;a book which is, in
the main, a reproduction of his ‘Notes’&mdash;the passage which I have
quoted disappears: equilateral triangle and skilled mathematicians
are left to the kindly obscurity of <cite>Nature</cite>. But if ‘the line Stonehenge&mdash;Old
Sarum’ and the line Stonehenge&mdash;Grovely Castle have
lost all significance, why persist in staking a hopeless case upon the
imaginary importance of the line Stonehenge&mdash;Sidbury Hill?</p>

<p>Sir Norman Lockyer has not restricted his researches to Stonehenge,
sun-worship, and the solstitial year. He has discovered instances
in which stone circles have been used for the observation not of
the sun but of the stars, and in which, ‘on account of the change
in a star’s place due to precession,’ ‘the sight line has been changed
in the Egyptian manner.’<a id="FNanchor_2245" href="#Footnote_2245" class="fnanchor">2245</a> Among these astral temples were ‘the
three circles of the Hurlers, near Liskeard’ and ‘the circles at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
Stanton Drew’. After an interesting calculation he announces that
‘we have the following declinations approximately:&mdash;</p>

<table  class="tdc">
  <tr>
    <td>The Hurlers.</td>
    <td>Lat. 50° 31′</td>
    <td>Stanton Drew.</td>
    <td>Lat. 51° 10′</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dec. N.</td>
    <td>38½°</td>
    <td>Dec. N.</td>
    <td>37°   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>”</td>
    <td>38°  </td>
    <td>”</td>
    <td>36½°</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>”</td>
    <td>37°  </td>
    <td />
    <td />
  </tr></table>

<p>Here then,’ he observes, ‘we have declinations to work on, but
declinations of what star? Vega is ruled out as its declination is
too high.’ He concludes that the star which ‘the astronomer-priests’
observed was Arcturus, and that ‘the approximate dates
of the use of the three circles at the Hurlers’ are 1600 <small>B.C.</small> for
the southern, 1500 for the central, and 1300 for the northern circle;
and at Stanton Drew 1260 <small>B.C.</small> for the great circle and 1075 <small>B.C.</small> for
the south-western circle.<a id="FNanchor_2246" href="#Footnote_2246" class="fnanchor">2246</a></p>

<p>Once more I am puzzled. Sir Norman remarks that all these
circles are considerably older than Stonehenge.<a id="FNanchor_2247" href="#Footnote_2247" class="fnanchor">2247</a> Stonehenge, he
says, was in use as a solar temple in 1680 <small>B.C.</small> and a good deal earlier:
none of the older circles began to be used as an astral temple until
1600 <small>B.C.</small> Why? Surely not because Arcturus, Capella, and Vega
all refuse to fit in with ‘the sight lines’ which Sir Norman has
discovered except at inconveniently late dates? Again, ‘Vega is
ruled out as its declination is too high.’ But the present declination
of Vega happens to be exactly 38½°. ‘In other words,’
as Mr. Webb writes to me, ‘there exists between the circle and one
of the brightest stars in the sky a perfect correspondence, which is
nevertheless, beyond all possibility of doubt, wholly accidental.’
Why did Sir Norman omit to mention this significant fact?</p>

<p>But second thoughts or kind friends have once more come to
Sir Norman’s rescue. In his book ‘Vega is ruled out as its declination
<i>was</i> too high’<a id="FNanchor_2248" href="#Footnote_2248" class="fnanchor">2248</a> (the italics are mine). ‘He had become aware,’
remarks the lynx-eyed Mr. Webb, ‘of the damaging fact that the
present declination of Vega actually <i>is</i> 38½° N., in other words that,
on his own principles, we can prove that the Hurlers were set up
to-day.’

<h2 id="PII_Pg483a">THE CASSITERIDES, ICTIS, AND THE
BRITISH TRADE IN TIN</h2>

<h3 id="PII_Pg483b">I. THE CASSITERIDES</h3>

<p>I. The identity of ‘the tin-islands’, which ancient writers called
the Cassiterides, is still a matter of dispute. Professor Haverfield,
indeed, has affirmed that ‘the recent researches of Usener [for which
read Unger], Rhys, and others, have made it almost certain that
the Cassiterides were off N.W. Spain’.<a id="FNanchor_2249" href="#Footnote_2249" class="fnanchor">2249</a> Professor Rhys shall
speak for himself. ‘M. Reinach,’ he says,<a id="FNanchor_2250" href="#Footnote_2250" class="fnanchor">2250</a> ‘argues, convincingly as
it seems to me, that the Cassiterides meant the Celtic islands, or, as
I may call them, the British Isles.’ And, if anything relating to this
question is certain, it is that the islands off North-Western Spain,
which are supposed to have been the tin-islands, have never produced
any tin at all.<a id="FNanchor_2251" href="#Footnote_2251" class="fnanchor">2251</a></p>

<p>One group of scholars insists that all the ancient writers who
mentioned the Cassiterides associated them with Spain. But what
if the ancient writers were misinformed, or misunderstood their informants?
Another group insists that for the metallurgists of
ancient Europe the sole source of tin was the British Isles; and with
this pronouncement they would apply the closure to the debate. But
the British Isles were not the sole source;<a id="FNanchor_2252" href="#Footnote_2252" class="fnanchor">2252</a> and the debaters persist
in wrangling. If the only question were, From what parts of Europe
did the Greeks and Romans derive tin, it could be answered in a
sentence:&mdash;from Galicia in Spain, Cornwall, and, possibly, the Scilly
Islands.<a id="FNanchor_2253" href="#Footnote_2253" class="fnanchor">2253</a> But this is not the only question. What we want to know
is, Were the ancient writers misled into believing that the Cassiterides
were islands? If they were not misled, were they all thinking of the
same islands? Or did they attempt to indicate the position of the
Cassiterides by simply guessing? If they were misled, was the
district to which their informants alluded Galicia or Cornwall, or
did they refer to both? Did the ancient writers fancy that islands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
used as depots for tin were the places in which the mines were situated?
Did those who professed to inform them intentionally
mislead them?</p>

<p>The theories which have recently held or still hold the field are,
first, that the Cassiterides were a group of islets off the north-western
coast of Spain; secondly, that they were headlands of the same coast;
thirdly, that they were the Scilly Islands; fourthly, that they were
Cornwall, which is supposed by some writers to have been regarded
either as an island or as a group of islands, separated by estuaries,
which were erroneously believed to be channels; and, lastly, that
they were the British Isles.<a id="FNanchor_2254" href="#Footnote_2254" class="fnanchor">2254</a></p>

<p>II. Diodorus Siculus,<a id="FNanchor_2255" href="#Footnote_2255" class="fnanchor">2255</a> after stating that tin was produced in Britain
and in many parts of Iberia, goes on to say that there are many tin
mines in the islands called Cassiterides, which are situated in the
ocean, off the coast of Iberia and above the country of the Lusitani.<a id="FNanchor_2256" href="#Footnote_2256" class="fnanchor">2256</a>
Strabo mentions the Cassiterides four times. In the first passage<a id="FNanchor_2257" href="#Footnote_2257" class="fnanchor">2257</a>
he says that the extremity of the Pyrenees is opposite the western
parts of Britain, and that the Cassiterides, which are situated in the
same latitude as Britain, are in the open sea, opposite to and north of
the Artabri. In the second<a id="FNanchor_2258" href="#Footnote_2258" class="fnanchor">2258</a> he mentions both the Cassiterides and the
British Isles, clearly distinguishing the two groups. In the third<a id="FNanchor_2259" href="#Footnote_2259" class="fnanchor">2259</a> he
says that, according to Posidonius, tin was produced in the country
beyond [that is to say, north of] the Lusitani, and also in the Cassiterides;
that tin was conveyed from the British Isles to Massilia, and
that, according to the same authority, tin, silver, and gold were produced
in the country of the Artabri, the most remote tribe of Lusitania,
who face the north-west. In the fourth<a id="FNanchor_2260" href="#Footnote_2260" class="fnanchor">2260</a> he says that the Cassiterides
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
are ten in number and lie close together in the open sea, north of the
harbour of the Artabri; that one of them is uninhabited; and that
the inhabitants of the rest wear black robes reaching down to their
feet, and walk about with staves in their hands, ‘like the Furies in
tragedy.’ They are, he says, nomadic, and live upon flesh meat;
and they barter tin and hides with merchants for pottery, salt, and
articles of bronze. Formerly, he adds, the Phoenicians monopolized
the trade from Gades, or Cadiz, with the islanders; and they kept the
route a close secret, which, however, the Romans, after numerous
attempts, succeeded in discovering. Finally, Publius Crassus sailed
across (διαβάς) to the islands, ascertained that the tin lay near the
surface, and indicated the route for the benefit of traders, ‘although
the passage was longer than that [from the continent] to Britain.’ In
another passage<a id="FNanchor_2261" href="#Footnote_2261" class="fnanchor">2261</a> Strabo says that the Artabri dwell in the neighbourhood
of the north-western promontory of Iberia, which he identifies
with the Nerian promontory.<a id="FNanchor_2262" href="#Footnote_2262" class="fnanchor">2262</a> Pomponius Mela,<a id="FNanchor_2263" href="#Footnote_2263" class="fnanchor">2263</a> himself
a Spaniard, immediately after speaking of Baetica and Lusitania,
and immediately before mentioning the island of Sena, which was
off the coast of Brittany, states that the Cassiterides are situated <i>in
Celticis</i>. Pliny<a id="FNanchor_2264" href="#Footnote_2264" class="fnanchor">2264</a> says that the Cassiterides, so called from the abundance
of tin which they produce, are situated over against Celtiberia,
and that opposite the promontory of the Arrotrebae are ‘the six
islands of the Gods’, which some call ‘the Fortunate Isles’. In
another passage<a id="FNanchor_2265" href="#Footnote_2265" class="fnanchor">2265</a> he says that tin was first fetched from ‘the island
Cassiteris’ (or from ‘the tin island’) by Midacritus, whom M. d’Arbois
de Jubainville,<a id="FNanchor_2266" href="#Footnote_2266" class="fnanchor">2266</a> wrongly, according to M. Salomon Reinach,<a id="FNanchor_2267" href="#Footnote_2267" class="fnanchor">2267</a>
identifies with ‘Melkarth, who personified the Phoenician race’. In
a third passage<a id="FNanchor_2268" href="#Footnote_2268" class="fnanchor">2268</a> Pliny says that tin has been fabulously reported to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
have been obtained from islands in the Atlantic. ‘Now,’ he continues,
‘it is certainly known to be produced in Lusitania and Galicia.’
By ‘islands in the Atlantic’ Pliny certainly did not, as Professor
Ridgeway supposes,<a id="FNanchor_2269" href="#Footnote_2269" class="fnanchor">2269</a> consciously mean the British Isles; for in his
geographical system the northern limit of the Atlantic was marked
by the north-western promontory of Spain.<a id="FNanchor_2270" href="#Footnote_2270" class="fnanchor">2270</a> Ptolemy<a id="FNanchor_2271" href="#Footnote_2271" class="fnanchor">2271</a> says that
the Cassiterides are ten in number, and are situated in the western
Ocean. Finally, Dionysius Periegetes<a id="FNanchor_2272" href="#Footnote_2272" class="fnanchor">2272</a> says that ‘the western isles’,
which produce tin, and are situated below the Sacred Promontory, or
Cape St. Vincent, are inhabited by Iberians.</p>

<p>From a comparison of these statements it is clear, first, that the
ancient geographers who mentioned the Cassiterides regarded them
as distinct from the British Isles; secondly, that they believed them
to be situated somewhere off the coast of Spain (although, as we shall
presently see, the words of Strabo are not inconsistent with the theory
that he identified them with the Scilly Islands, or even, unconsciously,
with the British Isles); thirdly, that of those who attempted to
define their position one associated them with the south-western, the
others with the north-western coast; fourthly, that one writer mentioned
<i>an</i> island, Cassiteris, from which tin was fetched; and, lastly,
that this same writer, having affirmed that the tin islands were
opposite Celtiberia, nevertheless denied that any islands in the
Ocean which extended as far north as the north-western promontory
of Spain produced tin.</p>

<p>III. Assume, for the sake of argument, that the Cassiterides were
off the north-western coast of Spain. What, then, are the islands with
which they are to be identified?</p>

<p>1. Unger<a id="FNanchor_2273" href="#Footnote_2273" class="fnanchor">2273</a> remarks that it may be inferred from Ptolemy’s statement
that they were south of the Nerian promontory and off the
western coast of Galicia. Strabo, it is true, places them northward
of the northern coast: but, says Unger,<a id="FNanchor_2274" href="#Footnote_2274" class="fnanchor">2274</a> Strabo is wrong; for
on the northern coast there are no islands distant more than
one German mile [or between four and five English miles] from
the shore, whereas Strabo himself says that the Cassiterides were
further from the continent than Britain. Dionysius Periegetes
was, by common consent, mistaken. Let us see then what islands
we can find off North-Western Spain. The coast between Cape
Ortegal and the mouth of the Douro is broken by several inlets
or fiords, which are called Rias. East of Cape Finisterre, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
the Ria de Corcubion, are three very small islands; and off the
south-eastern entrance of this Ria, by Cape Minarzo, are six tiny
islets. About 20 miles south-east of Cape Finisterre is the Ria of
Muros and Noya: on the west of Mount Louro, which dominates the
entrance of this fiord on its northern side, are the four small islands of
Bruyos; and there are others within the fiord itself and south of it.
Unger<a id="FNanchor_2275" href="#Footnote_2275" class="fnanchor">2275</a> remarks that the small size of all these islands harmonizes
with the word νησῖδες, or ‘islets’, which Diodorus applies to the
Cassiterides; and that the smallest of them may have been left out
of account when the number was given as ten. Off Pontevedra Bay,
which is north of Vigo Bay, are the islands of Ons and Orcela.</p>

<p>Strabo says that the harbour of the Artabri, north of which he
places the Cassiterides, was formed by a gulf on which were situated
numerous cities.<a id="FNanchor_2276" href="#Footnote_2276" class="fnanchor">2276</a> Mela<a id="FNanchor_2277" href="#Footnote_2277" class="fnanchor">2277</a> describes a gulf in the country of the
Artabri as having a narrow entrance and a wide circuit, and adds
that four streams flowed into it; and Ptolemy,<a id="FNanchor_2278" href="#Footnote_2278" class="fnanchor">2278</a> having first mentioned
a harbour of the Artabri, immediately south of the Nerian promontory,
speaks, in the next section but one, of ‘the Great Harbour’, on the
shore of which he places Brigantium. The gulf mentioned by Mela
and Ptolemy’s ‘Great Harbour’ correspond with the Ria of Betanzos
and Ferrol, which is between Cape Finisterre and Cape Ortegal;
but there are no islands north of this harbour. The identification of
the harbour of the Artabri which Ptolemy places immediately south
of the Nerian promontory depends of course upon the identification
of the promontory itself. The latter is generally identified with Cape
Finisterre; and if this view is correct, the harbour must have been
the Ria de Corcubion. Unger, however, identifies the Nerian
promontory with the bluff of land, between Cape Finisterre and
Corunna, from which project the headlands of Punta del Roncudo,
Punta de Nariga, and Cape de S. Adrian;<a id="FNanchor_2279" href="#Footnote_2279" class="fnanchor">2279</a> and if he is right, Ptolemy’s
harbour was the Ria of Corme and Lagos. But, as Unger points out,
there are no islands off this harbour or north of it.<a id="FNanchor_2280" href="#Footnote_2280" class="fnanchor">2280</a> It is clear, then,
that if the Cassiterides really lay in Spanish waters and on the
north of a harbour of the Artabri, that harbour must be looked for
further south. Now Unger<a id="FNanchor_2281" href="#Footnote_2281" class="fnanchor">2281</a> observes that Posidonius, as quoted
by Strabo,<a id="FNanchor_2282" href="#Footnote_2282" class="fnanchor">2282</a> makes the territory of the Artabri extend southward as
far as the river Douro; for he says that their territory produced gold;
and, says Unger, in the country of the Artabri, in the narrower sense,
there are no auriferous streams. Accordingly, Unger identifies the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
harbour for which he has been searching with the Puerto de Bayona,&mdash;the
southernmost inlet north of the Douro; and from this harbour
he maintains that Crassus sailed to the Cassiterides, which he identifies
with the islands of Bruyos. He points out that the distance from
the northern entrance of the harbour, opposite the island of Bayona,
to the islands of Bruyos is eight German miles. This distance exceeds
that of the shortest passage between Britain and the continent; and
accordingly Unger insists that it harmonizes with the statement of
Strabo. But the point which he most strenuously labours is that
‘in this case only is explicable the circumstance, strikingly calculated
to cause such a mistake as Strabo made, that Crassus sailed northward
from a harbour on the west coast [of Galicia], and yet sailed in
the open sea’.<a id="FNanchor_2283" href="#Footnote_2283" class="fnanchor">2283</a></p>

<p>Mr. Cecil Torr,<a id="FNanchor_2284" href="#Footnote_2284" class="fnanchor">2284</a> on the other hand, insists that ‘unless it can be
shown that there were tin mines on the islands [near Vigo], the story
[of the voyage of Crassus] cannot be used to show that Crassus
visited those islands’. Strabo, he adds, states precisely that the
Cassiterides ‘lay to the north of Ἀρτάβρων λιμήν’, which ‘is
obviously the gulf that now holds Ferrol and Corunna’. Here, as
we have seen, there are, <i>in Spanish waters</i>, no islands; and Mr. Torr
argues that ‘Strabo is so very accurate in his description of this part
of Spain that his account of the Cassiterides cannot be explained
away as an inaccurate description of the islands at Vigo.... It must
be a bit of downright fiction repeated in good faith.’<a id="FNanchor_2285" href="#Footnote_2285" class="fnanchor">2285</a> To this latter
argument it might be replied, first, that just as Strabo was mistaken
in supposing that the direction of the Pyrenees was from north to
south, so he may have been mistaken in supposing that the Cassiterides
were on the north of Spain; and, secondly, that the other
writers whose testimony has been quoted place them off the west coast.
No other reply, indeed, could be made by those who hold, like Unger,
that the Cassiterides were in Spanish waters. But, for reasons
which shall presently be given, I agree with Mr. Torr that Ἀρτάβρων
λιμήν must have been ‘the gulf that now holds Ferrol and Corunna’,
and also that Strabo’s ‘account of the Cassiterides cannot be
explained away as an inaccurate description of the islands at [or
rather near] Vigo’. Only I believe that he is wrong in regarding
that account as ‘fiction’. Strabo’s Cassiterides <i>were not in Spanish
waters at all: they were, as he says, in the open sea, and far to the north of
Corunna</i>. Mr. Torr’s other objection rests upon the fact that tin was
never produced in any island off the coast of Spain, except, possibly,
in Ons,<a id="FNanchor_2286" href="#Footnote_2286" class="fnanchor">2286</a> which, for reasons obvious to any one who consults the map
of Spain, Unger does not include among the Cassiterides. The only
possible answer to this objection has been already suggested in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
article: it is that the islands may have served as depots to which the
tin was conveyed from the mainland opposite, and that they may have
been confounded with the districts in which the tin was actually produced.
This suggestion, however, leaves unexplained the definite
statement of Strabo, that Crassus sailed across to the islands and found
that the islanders worked the tin easily because it lay near the surface.
There remain three other objections, which, unless Strabo’s authority
is to be absolutely discarded, appear insuperable. First, Strabo, I repeat,
distinctly states that the islands were ‘in the open sea’ (πελάγιαι);
and of the islands which Unger identifies with the Cassiterides not one
is more than four statute miles from the mainland, while the nearest
is not more than two. Secondly, as they are all within sight of land,
their situation could never have been kept secret. Lastly, since it
was unnecessary for those who desired to reach them to sail from
the harbour of Vigo, and easy to sail across from the neighbouring
Ria of Muros and Noya, it is difficult to understand why Strabo
should have said that the distance which separated them from the
mainland was greater than the distance from Gaul to Britain. It
is true that the islanders, according to Strabo, dressed in black, and
that, according to the same authority,<a id="FNanchor_2287" href="#Footnote_2287" class="fnanchor">2287</a> the inhabitants of Lusitania
did likewise; but any one who regards this as an argument for identifying
the Cassiterides with the islands near Vigo must make up his
mind to reject nearly all the details which are given by Strabo, and
to pin his faith to the undoubted fact that the Cassiterides are placed
by most of the ancient authorities off the coast of Spain. M. Salomon
Reinach, however, with whom I agree, argues that ‘the fact
that numerous [ancient] writers place the Cassiterides in geographical
connexion with Spain only proves&mdash;what we knew before&mdash;that
Phoenician Spain had commercial relations with those islands’.<a id="FNanchor_2288" href="#Footnote_2288" class="fnanchor">2288</a></p>

<p>2. M. Hans Hildebrand<a id="FNanchor_2289" href="#Footnote_2289" class="fnanchor">2289</a> thinks that the Cassiterides were headlands
of the Galician coast. He argues that if they are to be located
‘in England’, the name Cassiterides must be applied to headlands
in Cornwall; accordingly, he says, ‘je demande la même concession
pour ma théorie espagnole, savoir que ce nom désigne des caps.’<a id="FNanchor_2290" href="#Footnote_2290" class="fnanchor">2290</a>
But Cornwall is part of an island which is itself one of a group of
islands: Spain is not an island at all. M. Hildebrand’s theory can
by no ingenuity be defended except on the assumption that the
ancient writers were misled by the fact that in the language of the
Phoenicians, from whom the earliest notions about the Cassiterides
may be supposed to have been derived, there was no word which
specially denoted islands; and if it is accepted, not only must all the
statements of those writers which relate to the situation of the
islands, their number, their inhabitants, the mode in which the tin
was extracted, and the voyage of Crassus, be rejected as absolutely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
fictitious, but it is utterly impossible to conceive how they should
have originated.<a id="FNanchor_2291" href="#Footnote_2291" class="fnanchor">2291</a></p>

<p>3. The old-fashioned view, which identified the Cassiterides with
the Scilly Islands, has even of late years had adherents of high reputation,
such as Dr. von Gutschmid,<a id="FNanchor_2292" href="#Footnote_2292" class="fnanchor">2292</a> Emil Hübner,<a id="FNanchor_2293" href="#Footnote_2293" class="fnanchor">2293</a> and Mommsen.<a id="FNanchor_2294" href="#Footnote_2294" class="fnanchor">2294</a>
Although the bulk of the tin which supplied the wants of ancient
Europe came from Cornwall and Spain, it is nevertheless not improbable
that some came from the Scilly Islands.<a id="FNanchor_2295" href="#Footnote_2295" class="fnanchor">2295</a> If so, the real Cassiterides
were the Scilly Islands and ‘the adjacent island’ of Great
Britain. But of the ancient writers there were only two of whom it
can be maintained that when they referred to the Cassiterides they
were thinking either of the Scilly Islands or of Cornwall,&mdash;Festus
Avienus and Strabo.</p>

<p>Festus Avienus was a writer of the fourth century, whose <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ora
maritima</cite> was based either upon a Greek version of the Carthaginian
account of the voyage of Himilco,<a id="FNanchor_2296" href="#Footnote_2296" class="fnanchor">2296</a> or, as seems more probable, upon
a Greek poem, which had itself been compiled from two distinct Greek
narratives of different dates, the latter being assignable to the period
between 240 and 150 <small>B.C.</small><a id="FNanchor_2297" href="#Footnote_2297" class="fnanchor">2297</a> After describing the rocky peninsula,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
Oestrymnis, he says that in the gulf formed by it lie the islands called
Oestrymnides, which are widely scattered and rich in tin.<a id="FNanchor_2298" href="#Footnote_2298" class="fnanchor">2298</a> He does
not mention the Cassiterides at all. The Oestrymnides, however,
are generally, and, if Festus was right in saying that they produced
tin, necessarily identified with the Cassiterides: the peninsula is
rightly identified with Brittany,<a id="FNanchor_2299" href="#Footnote_2299" class="fnanchor">2299</a> or, more strictly speaking, with the
promontory formed by Finistère; and therefore the gulf is either
the Bay of Biscay, or the gulf in which lie the Channel Islands.
After describing the Oestrymnides, Festus goes on to say that ‘from
here it is two days’ sail to the Sacred Island’, that is to say, Ireland
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hinc duobus in sacram sic insulam Dixere prisci solibus cursus rati
est</i><a id="FNanchor_2300" href="#Footnote_2300" class="fnanchor">2300</a>); and then, remarking that ‘the island of the Albiones’, or
Britain, is near, he says that the Tartesii used to resort for trade to
the Oestrymnides, and that the Carthaginians also used to sail ‘these
seas’.<a id="FNanchor_2301" href="#Footnote_2301" class="fnanchor">2301</a></p>

<p>The question of the identity of the gulf is discussed by Friedrich
Marx in an article on the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ora maritima</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_2302" href="#Footnote_2302" class="fnanchor">2302</a> of which a summary has
been given by Mr. W. H. Stevenson.<a id="FNanchor_2303" href="#Footnote_2303" class="fnanchor">2303</a> Marx, says Mr. Stevenson,
‘explains the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub vertice</i> [of the promontory or peninsula, Oestrymnis]
of Avienus<a id="FNanchor_2304" href="#Footnote_2304" class="fnanchor">2304</a> as referring to the maps of antiquity, and as having the
sense of “northwards of”, so that the Tin Islands are conceived of
as north of the promontory of Finistère.... The Tin Islands must
therefore be the mainland of Britain and the Isle of Wight (which
Marx considers to be included among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">laxe iacentes insulae</i> of
Avienus), and cannot be explained as the Scilly Islands, which have
nothing beyond their insular nature to favour the identification.’
But why ‘therefore’? What has the Isle of Wight beyond <i>its</i>
‘insular nature’ to ‘favour the identification’? If Marx is right in
his interpretation of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub vertice</i>, the gulf (<i>sinus</i>) lay north of ‘the
promontory of Finistère’; and since it can hardly be maintained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
that this gulf was the English Channel, it must have been the gulf in
which lie the Channel Islands. If it was the English Channel,
Marx can hardly venture to argue that ‘the mainland of Britain’ is
<i>in</i> the Channel. If any conclusion can be drawn from the words of
Festus, it must be either that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">laxe iacentes insulae</i> were the
Channel Islands and the <i>sinus</i> the gulf in which they are situated,
or that the <i>sinus</i> was the Bay of Biscay and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">insulae</i> Ushant and
the adjacent islets. But I agree with Mr. Stevenson that ‘the Tin
Islands [of Avienus] ... cannot be explained as the Scilly Islands’,
unless the indications which Avienus gives of their situation are
utterly misleading.</p>

<p>Strabo, as we have seen, says that the Cassiterides were in
the open sea northward from the harbour of the Artabri; and
Mr. H. F. Tozer<a id="FNanchor_2305" href="#Footnote_2305" class="fnanchor">2305</a> argues that, according to Strabo’s ‘idea
of the relative position of these countries [Spain and Britain]
this would place them a great distance to the west of the Scilly
Islands’. This objection, however, assumes that Strabo was aware
that the Scilly Islands were comparatively close to the Land’s End.
Strabo imagined that the direction of the Pyrenees was from north to
south; that the coast of Gaul extended in a straight line from the
northern extremity of the Pyrenees to the mouth of the Rhine; and
that the southern coast of Britain extended from a point nearly
opposite and close to the northern extremity of the Pyrenees, parallel
with the coast of Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_2306" href="#Footnote_2306" class="fnanchor">2306</a> He expressly states that the Cassiterides
were in the same latitude as Britain; and therefore, if he had intended
to identify the Cassiterides with the Scilly Islands, it would have
been quite natural for him to say that they lay north of the harbour
of the Artabri.<a id="FNanchor_2307" href="#Footnote_2307" class="fnanchor">2307</a> Müllenhoff<a id="FNanchor_2308" href="#Footnote_2308" class="fnanchor">2308</a> indeed dismisses the claims of the
Scilly Islands with contempt; but all that he has to say against
them is that they never produced tin, and that they are small. The
former objection is, as we have seen, unfounded; the latter is irrelevant,
for small islands may contain mines, and the islands off the
coast of Spain are smaller still.</p>

<p>But I am not concerned to argue that the sailors from whom the
ancient writers, directly or indirectly, derived their information
intended to convey that the Cassiterides were the Scilly Islands and
the Scilly Islands alone; for, although the Scilly Islands did produce
some tin, by far the greater part of the British supply of that metal
doubtless came from Cornwall. Professor von Gutschmid indeed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
explains that ‘the tin was supposed [by the ancient writers]
to be produced where it was exchanged,&mdash;a very common case’;<a id="FNanchor_2309" href="#Footnote_2309" class="fnanchor">2309</a>
and although the place where the Cornish tin was exchanged
by the merchants who used the overland route was Ictis, or St.
Michael’s Mount,<a id="FNanchor_2310" href="#Footnote_2310" class="fnanchor">2310</a> the Phoenicians may possibly have found it convenient
to occupy one of the Scilly Islands.<a id="FNanchor_2311" href="#Footnote_2311" class="fnanchor">2311</a> But it seems to me safer
to conclude that the Scilly Islands may have been originally included
with Britain under the designation, <i>Cassiterides</i>.</p>

<p>The late distinguished geographer, H. Kiepert, maintained that
although the name, <i>Cassiterides</i>, had been originally used by the
Greeks to denote the tin-producing districts of Britain, it was
erroneously applied by Strabo to the Scilly Islands. ‘Only to this
group’, he insists, ‘can Strabo’s account of the discovery of the ten
small <i>Cassiterides</i>-islands on the north of Hispania by ... Publius
Crassus refer, as there are no other islands in this part of the ocean.’<a id="FNanchor_2312" href="#Footnote_2312" class="fnanchor">2312</a></p>

<p>4. George Smith, for whom the Cassiterides represented simply
the Cornish peninsula,<a id="FNanchor_2313" href="#Footnote_2313" class="fnanchor">2313</a> observed, anticipating a similar argument
of Mr. Cecil Torr,<a id="FNanchor_2314" href="#Footnote_2314" class="fnanchor">2314</a> that ‘the Hebrew, Phoenician, and cognate
languages had no terms which distinctly specified islands, peninsulas,
&amp;c.; one word being used to signify islands, sea-coasts, and even
remote countries. In these languages the whole coast of Cornwall
and Devonshire might be termed island or islands.’ It may be
objected that the very same argument might be used to show that
the name, <i>Cassiterides</i>, really denoted the headlands on the
coast of Galicia.<a id="FNanchor_2315" href="#Footnote_2315" class="fnanchor">2315</a> But it is easier to conceive how the misconception
should have arisen in the case of Cornwall, part of a remote
island in the northern ocean and close to the Scilly Islands, than in
the case of Galicia; and, moreover, the Galician theory leaves the
story of Crassus’s voyage unexplained. But the problem of the Cassiterides
cannot be satisfactorily solved by the simple statement that
they were Cornwall.</p>

<p>5. Müllenhoff,<a id="FNanchor_2316" href="#Footnote_2316" class="fnanchor">2316</a> M. Salomon Reinach, and various other writers
identify the Cassiterides with the British Isles. According to
M. Reinach,<a id="FNanchor_2317" href="#Footnote_2317" class="fnanchor">2317</a> ‘the whole question resolves itself into this:&mdash;what
islands in western Europe produce tin? The British Isles alone
fulfil this condition; therefore we must recognize in them the
archipelago of the Cassiterides.’ ‘If,’ he adds, ‘Strabo does not
identify them with the British Isles, though he mentions both the one
group and the other, this is because in the different chapters [of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
work] he follows different authorities, some of whom allude to the
Cassiterides from hearsay evidence collected in Spain, while the others
describe the British Isles from experience derived on the spot.’
Then, remarking that the alleged derivation of κασσίτερος (the
Greek word meaning ‘tin’) from a Sumerian word and from an
Assyrian word have been proved to be fanciful, he argues that
κασσίτερος did not, as most ancient and modern writers have supposed,
give its name to the Cassiterides, but on the contrary derived
its name from theirs. Similarly, he points out, at least four names
of metals have been derived from the names of places which produced
them, namely, copper from Cyprus; silver (in Gothic <i>silubr</i>) from
the town of Salybe in Pontus;<a id="FNanchor_2318" href="#Footnote_2318" class="fnanchor">2318</a> bronze from Brundisium; and
<i>Kalay</i>, the Turkish word for tin, from Kalah in the peninsula of
Malacca. M. Reinach goes on to argue that as the Greeks derived
their knowledge of the Cassiterides from the Phoenicians, the termination
ιδες must have been added by them. There remains therefore
<i>cassiteros</i>, of which the first part is found in numerous Celtic words,
for example, <i>Cassi</i>, <i>Cassi</i>-vellaunus, Velio-<i>casses</i>, &amp;c. M. Reinach
gives reasons, which appear to me unsatisfactory, for the conjecture
that <i>Cassiterides</i> means the same as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">insulae extimae</i> (‘the remotest
isles’); and he holds that the name was given to the British Isles
by the Celts of Western Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_2319" href="#Footnote_2319" class="fnanchor">2319</a></p>

<p>Whatever M. Reinach’s argument may be worth, he and Müllenhoff
are unquestionably right in one sense: the British Isles, taken as
a whole, were the only islands from which the ancients derived tin.
But this truism did not require demonstration. The question is,
whether the identification of the Cassiterides with the British Isles
can be reconciled with what was written about them by the ancient
geographers.</p>

<p>IV. The story which Strabo tells about Publius Crassus presents
some difficulty. As we have seen, he says that after the Romans
had discovered the route to the Cassiterides in spite of the efforts
which the Phoenicians made to conceal it, Crassus sailed across to
the islands, ascertained that the tin lay near the surface, and indicated
the new route for the benefit of traders. The first question is, who
was Crassus? Unger<a id="FNanchor_2320" href="#Footnote_2320" class="fnanchor">2320</a> maintains that he was the consul of 95 <small>B.C.</small>
who conquered the Lusitanians. If so, he must have sailed from the
mainland to the islands near Vigo which Unger identifies with the
Cassiterides. But, as I have already pointed out, these islands are
quite close to the coast: their distance from the mainland is not
greater, but many times less than the distance of Britain from the
Continent; their whereabouts could never have been kept secret;
and they have never produced tin. Therefore, if Publius Crassus
was the consul of 95 <small>B.C.</small>, Strabo’s story is utterly untrustworthy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_2321" href="#Footnote_2321" class="fnanchor">2321</a> holds that Crassus was Caesar’s lieutenant of that name,
and that he sailed from Gaul to the Scilly Islands before Caesar’s
first invasion of Britain.<a id="FNanchor_2322" href="#Footnote_2322" class="fnanchor">2322</a> How then are we to account for the
ignorance of Caesar, who tells us that tin was produced ‘in the midlands’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in mediterraneis regionibus</i><a id="FNanchor_2323" href="#Footnote_2323" class="fnanchor">2323</a>) of Britain? Professor Ridgeway,
who believes that the Cassiterides were the islands near Vigo,
also identifies Crassus with Caesar’s lieutenant, who, as he reminds us,
invaded Aquitania&mdash;the south-western division of Gaul&mdash;in 56 <small>B.C.</small>
‘He is all the more likely,’ writes Professor Ridgeway,<a id="FNanchor_2324" href="#Footnote_2324" class="fnanchor">2324</a> ‘to have
passed into Northern Spain, inasmuch as the people of that region
had given great assistance to the Aquitani ... (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, iii, 23). Without
doubt he was fully aware of the mineral wealth of that country,
as is shown by Caesar’s remark (iii, 21) on their skill in defending
cities, in consequence of their having numerous copper mines and
other works in that region. As is plain from Strabo’s words, the
Romans already knew how to reach the tin islands by sea, coasting
round from the Mediterranean and up from Gades on the old Phoenician
track. Crassus, then, by opening up a far shorter route, that
of a short sea voyage from the Cassiterides to the coast of Gaul
(possibly to the Garonne), at once developed this trade. The ore
lay near the surface. The distance by sea was greater than that
across the English Channel, but the readiness with which the tin
was obtained, combined with the shorter land transit, more than
compensated this. Strabo is evidently contrasting the rival tin-producing
regions when he introduces the allusion to Britain.... From
this achievement of Crassus and its results we can now understand in
its proper light the famous expression of Pytheas, that “the northern
parts of Iberia are more accessible towards Keltiké than for those
who sail by the ocean”.... He found, as Publius Crassus found three
centuries later, that the mineral regions and islands of North-Western
Spain were far more accessible for the Massaliotes by a land journey
across Gaul and a short sea voyage than by the long and perilous
route round by Gibraltar.’ But Professor Ridgeway mistranslates
‘the famous expression of Pytheas’,&mdash;τὰ προσαρκτικὰ μέρη τῆς Ἰβηρίας
εὐπαροδώτερα εἶναι [τοῖς] πρὸς τὴν Κελτικὴν ἢ κατὰ τὸν ὠκεανὸν πλέουσι.<a id="FNanchor_2325" href="#Footnote_2325" class="fnanchor">2325</a>
He fails to see that the word πλέουσι refers to πρὸς τὴν Κελτικήν
as well as to κατὰ τὸν ὠκεανόν. The passage simply means that
it is easier to sail along the northern coast of Iberia (Spain) from
west to east in the direction of Keltiké (Gaul) than to sail along the
southern coast from east to west in the direction of the Atlantic.<a id="FNanchor_2326" href="#Footnote_2326" class="fnanchor">2326</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
This, as Müllenhoff<a id="FNanchor_2327" href="#Footnote_2327" class="fnanchor">2327</a> observes, is perfectly true, owing to the set of
the current and the prevalence of westerly winds. Moreover, Professor
Ridgeway does not seem to be aware that there are no ‘tin
islands’ off the coast of Spain: he does not explain how Crassus
could have found time in 56 <small>B.C.</small> to make the ‘short sea voyage’ of
five hundred miles or more from the mouth of the Garonne to the
neighbourhood of Vigo, when he was campaigning in Aquitania until
the approach of winter;<a id="FNanchor_2328" href="#Footnote_2328" class="fnanchor">2328</a> nor, finally, does he explain how the
Massaliotes would have gained by conveying tin five hundred miles
from the neighbourhood of Vigo to the mouth of the Garonne, and
then considerably more than three hundred miles across Gaul to
Massilia, instead of overland across Spain. Mr. Tozer<a id="FNanchor_2329" href="#Footnote_2329" class="fnanchor">2329</a> disposes of
the difficulty by simply discrediting Strabo’s account. ‘There is no
reason,’ he says, ‘to doubt that Crassus made such an expedition;
but whatever the place was to which he went, his account is quite
untrustworthy, because he represents the Cassiterides as producing
tin, whereas that metal is not found in any of the groups of islands
which lie off the coasts of Gaul, or Britain, or Spain. The explicit
character of his statements, however, seems to have deceived his
contemporaries, and Strabo among them.’ But what theory can
Mr. Tozer frame to account for the gratuitous mendacity which he
imputes to Crassus, who, by the way, was not Strabo’s contemporary?<a id="FNanchor_2330" href="#Footnote_2330" class="fnanchor">2330</a>
Strabo’s story is, in any case, obviously inaccurate:<a id="FNanchor_2331" href="#Footnote_2331" class="fnanchor">2331</a> but I agree
with Mr. Tozer that it contains a kernel of truth; and I can only
suppose that Crassus, when he was in Brittany in 57-56 <small>B.C.</small>,<a id="FNanchor_2332" href="#Footnote_2332" class="fnanchor">2332</a> was
directed by Caesar to visit and report upon the tin-producing districts
of the British Isles.<a id="FNanchor_2333" href="#Footnote_2333" class="fnanchor">2333</a> And if I am asked how I account for the
mistake which Caesar made when he said that tin was produced in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
the interior of Britain, I offer the following suggestion. Crassus may
have contented himself with landing on the coast, perhaps at or near
St. Michael’s Mount, where the tin was delivered to the merchants:<a id="FNanchor_2334" href="#Footnote_2334" class="fnanchor">2334</a>
if so, he was doubtless informed that the tin was actually won in the
interior, as, in literal truth, it of course was;<a id="FNanchor_2335" href="#Footnote_2335" class="fnanchor">2335</a> and Caesar may
have hastily concluded from his report that the tin mines were far
from the coast. As to the details with which Strabo embellished
his story, it would be idle to conjecture from what source they were
obtained. We may be sure that he did not invent them; but he
may have confused items of information furnished by different
authorities.<a id="FNanchor_2336" href="#Footnote_2336" class="fnanchor">2336</a></p>

<p>V. The conclusion of the matter is this. The statements of Strabo
are most satisfactorily explained on the hypothesis that those from
whom he, directly or indirectly, derived his information referred to
the Scilly Isles and probably also the Cornish peninsula, or (which is
less probable) to islands off the coast of Brittany, at which trading
vessels may have touched on the voyage. All the other ancient
writers, except perhaps Polybius, undoubtedly associated the
Cassiterides with Spain. In so doing they were mistaken; for no
islands in Spanish waters, except Ons, which is out of the question,
have ever produced tin. The real Cassiterides&mdash;the ‘tin islands’
which were known to the mariners from whom the ancient writers
ultimately derived their notions&mdash;were, speaking generally, the
British Isles, and particularly, the tin-producing districts of Cornwall
and perhaps also the Scilly Islands. It is possible that Polybius<a id="FNanchor_2337" href="#Footnote_2337" class="fnanchor">2337</a>
may have held this view; for he does not mention the Cassiterides,
and names the British Isles as the source of tin.</p>

<p>How the ancients came to entertain such vague notions about the
Cassiterides, is not difficult to conceive. Evidently, when they first
heard of them, all that they could learn was that they were somewhere
in the western ocean. Knowing that Gades was the centre of
the tin trade, they would naturally assume that they were in Spanish
waters<a id="FNanchor_2338" href="#Footnote_2338" class="fnanchor">2338</a>; and even when they learned that tin came from Britain
and from Galicia, they would cling to the idea that it came also from
islands, the geographical position of which the crafty Phoenicians
had striven to keep secret. Mr. Tozer<a id="FNanchor_2339" href="#Footnote_2339" class="fnanchor">2339</a> may possibly be right in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
suggesting that ‘when the nations about the Mediterranean obtained
more accurate information concerning the north-western coasts of
Europe, it was natural that they should affix the name to one or
other of the groups of islands with which they found the trade to be
associated’. ‘Thus,’ he continues, ‘by some writers it may have
been attached to the Oestrymnides, by others to the islands of the
Galician coast, and even the Scillies may in some cases have been
intended.’ But is it not likely that the writers in question, when
they attempted to locate the Cassiterides, were not identifying them
with any group of islands the existence of which was certainly known
to them, and the whereabouts of which they knew? M. Salomon
Reinach puts the matter well, though he fails to perceive that Strabo
was not referring to islands in Spanish waters. ‘There were two
traditions,’ he says, ‘relating to the tin islands,&mdash;one Phoenician,
of which the starting-point was Southern Spain; the other Greek,
which originated at Marseilles. With that respect for the written
word which characterized them, the ancients accepted the two
traditions side by side.... Even after the expedition of Crassus ... Pliny
dared not reject the geographical legend which connected the
islands with Spain; and a century later Ptolemy persisted in the
same error.’<a id="FNanchor_2340" href="#Footnote_2340" class="fnanchor">2340</a></p>

<p>Mr. W. H. Stevenson explains that Müllenhoff, of whose conclusions
respecting the Cassiterides he gives a lucid summary, holds that
they ‘were marked by guess-work on the early Greek maps ... off
the north-west coast of Spain ... and that they there remained on
the maps (much like the mythical island of Brazil in fifteenth-century
maps), although they had been known since the time of Pytheas,
under the names of Britannia, Albion, Ierne, &amp;c., without their
identity being suspected. In a precisely similar manner the Electridae,
which had been put into the maps by guess-work, were retained
long after it was known that amber came from the shores of the
Baltic, and not from islands in the North Sea.’<a id="FNanchor_2341" href="#Footnote_2341" class="fnanchor">2341</a></p>

<p>Thus the important point to bear in mind is that the name
<i>Cassiterides</i>, which must, as Kiepert says, have been originally
applied to the British Isles, was afterwards misapplied to imaginary
islands, and applied by Strabo, not perhaps without some foundation
in fact, to the Scilly group.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span></p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg499">II. ICTIS AND THE BRITISH TRADE IN TIN</h3>

<h4>Let us now consider the British trade in tin.</h4>

<p>I. Diodorus Siculus<a id="FNanchor_2342" href="#Footnote_2342" class="fnanchor">2342</a> states, on the authority of Timaeus, who
derived his information on this matter from Pytheas,<a id="FNanchor_2343" href="#Footnote_2343" class="fnanchor">2343</a> that tin was
conveyed by the people of Belerium (the Land’s End) in wagons at
low tide from the British mainland to an island called Ictis; purchased
there by merchants from the natives; carried to Gaul; and
transported on pack-horses to the mouth of the Rhône,<a id="FNanchor_2344" href="#Footnote_2344" class="fnanchor">2344</a> the overland
journey lasting thirty days. In another chapter<a id="FNanchor_2345" href="#Footnote_2345" class="fnanchor">2345</a> he says, following
Posidonius, that tin was carried from Britain to Gaul, and then
conveyed on horseback to Massilia and to Narbo. Pliny<a id="FNanchor_2346" href="#Footnote_2346" class="fnanchor">2346</a> states,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
quoting Timaeus as his authority, that there was an island called
Mictis, six days’ sail from Britain, which produced tin, and to which
the Britons sailed in coracles. Strabo tells us that Corbilo in the
estuary of the Loire<a id="FNanchor_2347" href="#Footnote_2347" class="fnanchor">2347</a> ‘was formerly an emporium’; and, as we
learn from Polybius, who couples it with Narbo and Massilia, that in
the time of Scipio Aemilianus it was one of the principal towns of
Gaul,<a id="FNanchor_2348" href="#Footnote_2348" class="fnanchor">2348</a> it is probable that it was at one period the Gallic port to which
British tin, destined for the Mediterranean markets, was conveyed.<a id="FNanchor_2349" href="#Footnote_2349" class="fnanchor">2349</a></p>

<p>II. Now the first thing to do is to identify Ictis or Mictis; for it is
admitted that they were the same.<a id="FNanchor_2350" href="#Footnote_2350" class="fnanchor">2350</a> According to Elton<a id="FNanchor_2351" href="#Footnote_2351" class="fnanchor">2351</a> and Professor
Rhys,<a id="FNanchor_2352" href="#Footnote_2352" class="fnanchor">2352</a> Ictis was the Isle of Thanet. ‘The important point’,
says Elton, ‘remains that the tin ... was stored at some place, which
was supposed to have lain at six days’ voyage from the mineral
district; and it seems reasonable to identify it with the Isle of
Thanet, at which the marts were established from which the merchants
made the shortest passage to Gaul.’ But there is no evidence that
‘the marts were established’ in the Isle of Thanet, or that ‘the
merchants made the shortest passage to Gaul’; nor is there one word
in Pliny (whose statement shall be considered presently) to justify
Elton in stating as a ‘fact’ that the tin was ‘stored at some place
which was supposed to have lain at six days’ voyage from the mineral
district’.<a id="FNanchor_2353" href="#Footnote_2353" class="fnanchor">2353</a> The view that Ictis was the Isle of Thanet is absolutely
untenable. ‘If,’ says Professor Ridgeway,<a id="FNanchor_2354" href="#Footnote_2354" class="fnanchor">2354</a> ‘it was Thanet, it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
follows that the tin was brought all the way from Devon, which
was impossible, as the great forest of Anderida stretched right from
Hampshire into Kent.’ Formerly the professor held that ‘the only
difficulty in identifying Ictis with the Isle of Wight is the statement
of Diodorus ... that the tin was conveyed across to the island at low
water’; for ‘geologists maintain that Wight could not have been
joined to the mainland in historic times’. Geologists, however, as
we shall presently see, have changed their minds; and accordingly
Professor Ridgeway has changed his. I shall therefore only take
account of those parts of his argument which are not obsolete.
‘Mr. Elton,’ he observes, ‘seems to forget that if the Britons brought
the tin a six days’ voyage from Cornwall to Thanet, there would be no
need to bring it overland by waggons across the estuary at low water.... Diodorus
and Timaeus are substantially agreed that there was an
island where the tin came to market, and that its name was Ictis or
Mictis.... The tin could not be carried overland on account of the
forests, and they certainly would not convey it all round the south
and south-east coasts to the Straits, and then round the coast of
Gaul to Corbilo, if it was at all possible to get across at a nearer
point. The passage from the Isle of Wight to the Channel Islands,
and thence to Armorica and Corbilo, would best attain this object.’
Professor Ridgeway then invokes numismatic evidence. He states
that Gallic coins of a peculiar type have been found in the southern
and western parts of England, in the Channel Islands, and in the
territories of the Turones, Pictones, Redones, Namnetes, all the
tribes of the Armorican peninsula, and the Volcae Tectosages.
‘Follow the peoples enumerated above on the map,’ he says, ‘and
we shall find them all lying in the basins of the Garonne and Loire.... This
evidence, then, points unmistakably to a route direct from
Armorica to the southern coast of Britain, or, in other words, supports
strongly the doctrine that the Isle of Wight was the island called
Ictis.’<a id="FNanchor_2355" href="#Footnote_2355" class="fnanchor">2355</a></p>

<p>Professor Ridgeway’s arguments, as directed against the theory of
Elton and Professor Rhys, are conclusive. Ictis was certainly not
Thanet. But the argument which he adduces from numismatic
evidence in favour of its identification with the Isle of Wight rests
upon the assumption that the coins in question could not have
found their way to the Channel Islands except in the course of the
tin trade. The Dumnonii, in whose country the tin was produced, had
no coinage of their own, and apparently made little use of money:<a id="FNanchor_2356" href="#Footnote_2356" class="fnanchor">2356</a>
the coins to which Professor Ridgeway alludes were far later than
the time of Pytheas; and the professor himself affirms that in the
time of Posidonius, whom he wrongly regards as Diodorus’s authority
for the description of Ictis, the route from Ictis to Corbilo had been
abandoned. Nor is it easy to understand why the traders who conveyed
tin from Cornwall to Marseilles should have needlessly added
between 300 and 400 miles to the length and a corresponding amount
to the expense of the journey. Professor Ridgeway has himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
made use of this very argument to prove that Ictis was not the Isle
of Thanet: can he not see that it tells with equal force against his
own theory, that Ictis was the Isle of Wight?<a id="FNanchor_2357" href="#Footnote_2357" class="fnanchor">2357</a></p>

<p>Mr. Alfred Tylor<a id="FNanchor_2358" href="#Footnote_2358" class="fnanchor">2358</a> insists that ‘St. Michael’s Mount’, which was
formerly identified with Ictis, ‘is a steep rock, and does not form
a harbour at all.’ What if it is a steep rock? Does not Thucydides<a id="FNanchor_2359" href="#Footnote_2359" class="fnanchor">2359</a>
tell us that the Phoenicians ‘fortified headlands on the sea-coast [of
Sicily], and settled in the small islands adjacent, for the sake of
trading with the Sicels’?<a id="FNanchor_2360" href="#Footnote_2360" class="fnanchor">2360</a> Nobody who knows St. Michael’s Mount
will contend that there would have been the slightest difficulty in
conveying tin on to the small plain on its landward side,<a id="FNanchor_2361" href="#Footnote_2361" class="fnanchor">2361</a> or in loading
with tin vessels moored beneath it. Diodorus Siculus does not
mention any harbour in connexion with Ictis; but, as a writer who
knew every inch of the Cornish coast long ago pointed out, St.
Michael’s Mount afforded perfect shelter for shipping.<a id="FNanchor_2362" href="#Footnote_2362" class="fnanchor">2362</a> ‘It still,’
says Sir Charles Lyell,<a id="FNanchor_2363" href="#Footnote_2363" class="fnanchor">2363</a> ‘affords a good port, daily frequented by
vessels, <i>where cargoes of tin are sometimes taken on board, after having
been transported, as in the olden time, at low tide across the isthmus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2364" href="#Footnote_2364" class="fnanchor">2364</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
Colliers of 500 tons’ burden can now enter the harbour, which
is on the landward or sheltered side of the Mount.’</p>

<p>But the Isle of Wight has recently found a new champion,&mdash;the
eminent geologist, Mr. Clement Reid.<a id="FNanchor_2365" href="#Footnote_2365" class="fnanchor">2365</a> He affirms that at the time
when tin was shipped at Ictis, ‘St. Michael’s Mount must have been
an isolated rock rising out of a swampy wood.’ By an interesting
process of reasoning, based upon evidence which he collected while
revising ‘the geological map of the northern part of the Isle of Wight’,
and afterwards while mapping ‘the whole of the adjacent parts of
the mainland’, he arrives at the conclusion that about 100 <small>B.C.</small> a
limestone causeway, over which wagons could pass at low tide,
extended from the western side of the river Yar to the coast of
Hampshire opposite Pennington Marshes. He explains that the tin
was transported by this causeway to the Isle of Wight instead of
being shipped in one of the Hampshire harbours because the latter
‘are all more or less exposed to the prevalent south-west wind, and
are sheltered by no high land’, and, moreover, ‘the harbours outside
the Solent were probably always rendered dangerous by bars of
sand and shingle.’ Finally, he contends that the identification of
Ictis with the Isle of Wight shows that ‘the ancient writers can be
literally depended on, and that their descriptions are thoroughly in
keeping with each other’. Pliny was right in saying that Mictis
‘is distant inwards from Britain six days’ voyage’, for ‘six days’
coasting from the mouth of the Exe would amply suffice to bring
boats to the Isle of Wight’; and since ‘a coasting trade of this sort
would go direct to the Isle of Wight side of the Solent’, Pliny’s
account, which is based on Timaeus, naturally makes ‘no mention
of the causeway alluded to by Diodorus, writing at a later date’.
(Mr. Reid presumably means, not that Diodorus wrote later than
Pliny, but that Posidonius, whom he assumes to have been Diodorus’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
authority, wrote later than Timaeus.) Caesar is right in saying that
tin was found in the interior, ‘for he refers to the British part of the
trade-route,’ that is to say, the (assumed) overland journey from
Cornwall to the Hampshire coast. Diodorus is right because the
limestone causeway answers to his description.</p>

<p>I submit that whoever is right, Mr. Clement Reid is wrong, because
the only equipment which he brings to the discussion is the special
knowledge of the geologist. Doubtless he has proved the former
existence of a causeway between Hampshire and the Isle of Wight;
but it does not follow that the Isle of Wight was Ictis unless it can be
proved that ‘St. Michael’s Mount must have been an isolated rock
rising out of a swampy wood’.</p>

<p>Can this be proved? I have searched all the relevant geological
and geographical literature, and have failed to find any evidence in
support of Mr. Reid’s assertion. The testimony of geologists, except
Mr. Reid, is all the other way. Sir Charles Lyell,<a id="FNanchor_2366" href="#Footnote_2366" class="fnanchor">2366</a> Mr. Pengelley,<a id="FNanchor_2367" href="#Footnote_2367" class="fnanchor">2367</a>
and Mr. Ussher<a id="FNanchor_2368" href="#Footnote_2368" class="fnanchor">2368</a> of the Geological Survey all hold that since the
time when tin was shipped at Ictis, St. Michael’s Mount has undergone
no sensible change. But Mr. Reid has recently been revising
the old geological survey of Cornwall; and he tells me that he reached
his conclusion by calculating the rate at which the sea washed away
alluvium which once connected St. Michael’s Mount with the mainland.
Moreover, although he does not actually rely upon the hoary
fable, demolished by Max Müller, of ‘the Hoar Rock in the Wood’, he
laid stress in conversation with me upon the prevalence in Cornwall
of a tradition which supported his conclusion,&mdash;a tradition which,
Max Müller’s readers know, is simply worthless.<a id="FNanchor_2369" href="#Footnote_2369" class="fnanchor">2369</a></p>

<p>Now I would ask geologists whether it is not dangerous to strive
after chronological precision in geological inquiries by reasoning
which assumes that nature worked during a long period of remote
time at a uniform rate of speed. The calculations by which Sir
Archibald Geikie laboured years ago to estimate the time which the
Thames occupied in excavating its valley,<a id="FNanchor_2370" href="#Footnote_2370" class="fnanchor">2370</a> the calculations which
geologists have made as to the time required for the deposition of
the layers of stalagmite in caves,<a id="FNanchor_2371" href="#Footnote_2371" class="fnanchor">2371</a> have been proved to be futile.
This much at all events is certain: if Mr. Reid’s calculation is
accurate, it stultifies the testimony of the ancient authors to whom
he appeals.</p>

<p>For I would ask Mr. Reid how he proposes to reconcile his own statement,
‘that the ancient writers can be literally depended on,’ with
the assumption, which he admits that he is compelled to make in
order to show ‘the perfect consistency of the accounts’, that ‘Mictis
and Ictis were the same island as Vectis’. Is he not aware that in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
Pliny’s <cite>Natural History</cite><a id="FNanchor_2372" href="#Footnote_2372" class="fnanchor">2372</a> [M]ictis and Vectis are distinguished? If
he had studied Müllenhoff’s great work, he would not have attempted
to reconcile Pliny’s account of the six days’ voyage to [M]ictis with
Diodorus’s account, which ‘mentions only the causeway to Ictis’,
by assuming that the writer whom Diodorus followed lived two
centuries later than Timaeus. For Diodorus’s account was not, as
Mr. Reid fancies, based upon Posidonius; he also, like Pliny, derived
his information immediately from Timaeus, ultimately from Pytheas.
Not less hopeless is Mr. Reid’s attempt to explain Pliny’s account
of the voyage to [M]ictis. How could the Isle of Wight be described
as ‘distant inwards from Britain six days’ voyage’? Because, says
Mr. Reid, ‘the Isle of Wight and more easterly parts of the south of
England were politically part of Gaul perhaps even at that early date
[300 <small>B.C.</small>]; the tin-producing “Britain” was apparently outside
the dominion of the Belgae, and must have been Devon and Cornwall.’
This argument rests upon a doubtful ‘perhaps’, an obscure
‘apparently’, a desperate ‘must have been’, and the baseless
assumption that the Belgae had established dominion in Britain in
the time of Pytheas: it leaves the word ‘inwards’ unexplained; and
it is pulverized by the mere fact that in the very chapter from which
Mr. Reid is quoting and everywhere else Pliny uses the word Britain
not in the sense of ‘Devon and Cornwall’, but simply in the sense of
Britain. To any man who is not obliged to distort the plain meaning
of words it is clear that, from Pliny’s point of view, Ictis was six
days’ sail from Britain, and that by ‘inwards’ he meant, speaking
from the standpoint of an Italian, ‘northward.’ Thus London
might be intelligibly described as fifty-two miles ‘inwards’ from
Brighton; but to say that Brighton is a day’s sail ‘inwards’ from
Portsmouth would be gibberish. As Müllenhoff has pointed out,
Pliny confounded the distance of Ictis from Britain with that of Thule.<a id="FNanchor_2373" href="#Footnote_2373" class="fnanchor">2373</a></p>

<p>Enough of Mr. Reid’s attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable. Like
Professor Ridgeway, he does not explain why men of business preferred
to pay the cost of the long voyage from the Isle of Wight to
the mouth of the Loire, when they need only have paid for the
shorter voyage from Cornwall, or why they chose to saddle themselves
with the cost of the overland transport from Cornwall to
Hampshire. Nor does he explain why this imaginary and expensive
overland transport was substituted for the imaginary coasting
voyage. Nor again does he explain how wagons, loaded with tin
(for Diodorus does not speak of pack-horses except in connexion
with the journey across Gaul), were able to travel two hundred miles
along unmetalled trackways. The rate at which they crawled, the
numerous breaks down, the curses of the drivers, and the wear and
tear of the cattle I leave to Mr. Reid’s imagination. The eminent
archaeologist, Mr. C. H. Read, who accepts Mr. Reid’s conclusions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
assures us that a voyage from St. Michael’s Mount to the mouth of
the Loire is not to be thought of, for it would have involved a ‘long
and dangerous sea passage’.<a id="FNanchor_2374" href="#Footnote_2374" class="fnanchor">2374</a> Is he serious? This long sea passage
was far shorter than the passage from the Isle of Wight: why it was
more dangerous than a passage which involved navigation in the
neighbourhood of the Channel Islands as well as of Ushant no seaman
will be able to understand. The passage which seems so terrible to
Mr. Read was made by Pytheas.<a id="FNanchor_2375" href="#Footnote_2375" class="fnanchor">2375</a> The passage from Italy to Sardinia
was longer: several times longer was the passage from Britain
to Iceland, which was made long before the invention of the
compass;<a id="FNanchor_2376" href="#Footnote_2376" class="fnanchor">2376</a> as long or longer the passage from Scandinavia to Britain,
which was made, according to Mr. Read himself,<a id="FNanchor_2377" href="#Footnote_2377" class="fnanchor">2377</a> in the Bronze Age.
That the Veneti should have been quite willing to sail from the Isle of
Wight to the Loire, but so afraid of sailing in their stout ships from
Cornwall that they deliberately added more than a hundred miles
to the length of their voyage, is a mystery which Mr. Read must be
left to explain.</p>

<p>But Mr. Reid, in the conversation which passed between us, urged
reasons in favour of his theory which are omitted in his paper and
to which I shall endeavour to do justice. Archaeological evidence,
he remarked, shows that the people of Cornwall were far more uncivilized
than those of Hampshire: even supposing that St. Michael’s
Mount was an island, it had no real harbour; and it would have been
very dangerous for mariners to attempt to get there especially in
a fog or a south-westerly gale. I reply that it would also have been
dangerous in such weather to attempt to fetch the coast of the Isle
of Wight, as the ship would have incurred the risk of running a-tilt
against the limestone causeway; that in a fog the skipper would have
anchored; and that, notwithstanding the lack of a proper harbour,
the ship would have lain snugly in sheltered water under the lee of
St. Michael’s Mount. The comparative barbarism of the people of
Cornwall is irrelevant: as they wanted to sell their tin, there was no
danger that they would molest their customers. Besides, Mr. Reid
seems to forget that the people who produced the tin delivered it
to the traders at Ictis. The traders transacted business directly
with them; and, assuming that Ictis was the Isle of Wight, they
were as barbarous when they had crossed the limestone causeway
as they had been when they left the tin mines. Mr. Reid’s argument
compels him once more to throw overboard the ancient authority,
who, as he insists, ‘can be literally depended on’; for Diodorus
distinctly states that the tin-mining inhabitants of Belerium were
friendly to strangers, and <i>from their intercourse with foreign merchants</i>
had become comparatively civilized.<a id="FNanchor_2378" href="#Footnote_2378" class="fnanchor">2378</a> This passage proves that,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
according to Diodorus, Ictis was in the territory of Belerium, and by
itself demolishes Mr. Reid’s theory. For how could the inhabitants
have become civilized by their commercial dealings if the merchants
never came near Belerium, and the only inhabitants who came in
contact with them were wagoners or boatmen?</p>

<p>It is clear then that the case for the Isle of Wight rests upon the
geological evidence, such as it is, that at the time when Ictis was
a trading station, St. Michael’s Mount was ‘an isolated rock rising
out of a swampy wood’. Common sense and the historical evidence
are all on the other side. If St. Michael’s Mount had not been available,
there would have been nothing to prevent the traders from
shipping the tin at Falmouth or in Plymouth Sound; and acceptance
of Mr. Reid’s theory involves, besides other insuperable difficulties,
the assumption that the tin-merchants were ignorant of the first
principles of business.</p>

<p>III. We now come to the question, When did the overland trade
in tin between Corbilo and Massilia begin, and how long did it last?
That it existed before the time of Pytheas&mdash;that is to say, at least
as early as the fourth century before Christ&mdash;is certain;<a id="FNanchor_2379" href="#Footnote_2379" class="fnanchor">2379</a> for, as we
have seen, Pliny and Diodorus Siculus derived their information
about Ictis ultimately from him.<a id="FNanchor_2380" href="#Footnote_2380" class="fnanchor">2380</a> Müllenhoff,<a id="FNanchor_2381" href="#Footnote_2381" class="fnanchor">2381</a> indeed, contends for a
still earlier date. Only on this hypothesis, he argues, can we explain
the remarkable fact that the great Celtic immigration at the beginning
of the fourth century <small>B.C.</small> not only did no harm to Massilia but
actually increased its prosperity, the profits of the trade being
appreciated by the Celts themselves. Still, there is no evidence
that it existed (except in the form of intertribal barter) before the
foundation of Massilia, or even that it had begun long before Pytheas
visited Britain.</p>

<p>Professor Ridgeway insists that it is ‘obvious that when the
Belgic tribes ... made permanent settlements on the south-east coast
of Britain, the course of trade would pass regularly from Kent into
Northern France, and that the old route by Armorica, Corbilo, and
the Loire would fall into disuse’.<a id="FNanchor_2382" href="#Footnote_2382" class="fnanchor">2382</a> If anything is ‘obvious’, it is
that the course of trade would continue to follow the most convenient
route, and that merchants would not saddle themselves with
the expense of conveying tin, destined for Mediterranean markets,
all the way from Cornwall to Kent. Besides, how was it to be
conveyed thither? Certainly not by land; for Professor Ridgeway
tells us himself that the barrier interposed by the great forest of
Anderida would have rendered this impossible.<a id="FNanchor_2383" href="#Footnote_2383" class="fnanchor">2383</a> Certainly not by
sea; for, unless the merchants had taken leave of their senses, why
should they have paid for the voyage from Cornwall to Kent, then
for the voyage from Kent to Boulogne, and then for the long overland
journey to Marseilles, when, by taking the route which led
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
from St. Michael’s Mount to the mouth of the Loire, both the voyage
and the land journey would have been considerably shortened? If
Caesar does not expressly mention Corbilo, neither does he expressly
mention any other commercial port; and he does imply that the
Veneti had the lion’s share of the carrying trade with Britain.<a id="FNanchor_2384" href="#Footnote_2384" class="fnanchor">2384</a>
Possibly Corbilo had lost its importance by the time of Caesar; but
the estuary of the Loire still formed one of the two most important
harbours in the west of Gaul, and Strabo mentions it as one of the
four principal Gallic ports from which ships bound for Britain set
sail.<a id="FNanchor_2385" href="#Footnote_2385" class="fnanchor">2385</a> The argument based upon the fact that the overland journey
lasted thirty days implies that the merchants would have deliberately
preferred a longer to a shorter route; and as the distance from
the mouth of the Loire to Massilia was about four hundred and eighty
miles <i>in a straight line</i>, it does not seem incredible that the journey
should have lasted thirty days. But what puzzles me most in Professor
Ridgeway’s argument is that, while it is partly based upon the
testimony of Diodorus, it sets that testimony at defiance. The
professor holds that the authority whom Diodorus followed was
Posidonius. If so, Posidonius stated that in his time British tin
was shipped for the Continent at Ictis. Now Professor Ridgeway
identifies Ictis with the Isle of Wight. I have shown that Ictis was
St. Michael’s Mount. But, according to Professor Ridgeway, British
tin was shipped, in the time of Posidonius, neither at the Isle of
Wight, nor at St. Michael’s Mount, but in Kent.<a id="FNanchor_2386" href="#Footnote_2386" class="fnanchor">2386</a> The train of
thought which led to this conclusion is one which my poor brain is
powerless to follow.<a id="FNanchor_2387" href="#Footnote_2387" class="fnanchor">2387</a></p>

<p>Professor Haverfield<a id="FNanchor_2388" href="#Footnote_2388" class="fnanchor">2388</a> affirms that the Roman annexation of
Gallia Narbonensis ‘secured that trade route by which Diodorus
Siculus tells us that British tin reached the Mediterranean, that is the
route from Narbo by the “pass of Carcassonne” and Toulouse to
Bordeaux’; but I cannot find any evidence that this was the route
to which Diodorus referred.</p>

<p>Professor Rhys<a id="FNanchor_2389" href="#Footnote_2389" class="fnanchor">2389</a> has constructed a theory about the course of the
tin trade during the maritime supremacy of the Veneti which is even
more remarkable than that of Professor Ridgeway. He tells us that
‘at one time they probably landed British tin at the mouth of [the
Loire] ... and they fetched some of it at any rate from the south-east
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
of Britain’. In other words, the tin was conveyed at heavy cost
by the Britons three hundred miles from Cornwall to the south-east
of Britain, in order that the Veneti might add at least two hundred
miles to the voyage which they would have undertaken if they had
fetched it direct from Cornwall; and this was done although, as
Professor Rhys himself assures us, there was ‘communication between
the Dumnonii [of Cornwall] and the nearest part of Gaul during the
Venetic period’. The professor adds that ‘whatever direct trade in
tin there may have been between the tin districts of Britain and the
Loire, it must have been utterly unknown to Caesar’. I reply that if,
as Professor Rhys holds, there was trade in tin by way of South-Eastern
Britain between the tin districts of Britain and the Loire, this trade
also must, on Professor Rhys’s theory, have been unknown to Caesar,
for he mentions neither the one nor the other; but that the voyage
which Crassus made to the tin-producing districts of Cornwall, and
about which Caesar is equally silent, shows that Caesar was not
ignorant, but merely reticent.</p>

<p>But Professor Ridgeway would assign a different reason for
Caesar’s silence. Remarking that ‘when Strabo, writing as a contemporary,
is describing the exports from Britain, he omits the
mention of tin, whilst from the extract from Posidonius, quoted alike
by him and Diodorus, it is plain that when the Stoic explorer visited
North-Western Europe, the British tin trade was still of importance’,
the professor suggests that in the time of Caesar Britain ceased
to export tin.<a id="FNanchor_2390" href="#Footnote_2390" class="fnanchor">2390</a> But did not Strabo write long after Caesar died?
Professor Haverfield, on the other hand, has given reasons for the
view that ‘the early Cornish tin trade, which Posidonius and Caesar
knew, died out about the beginning of our era’; and he suggests
that it may have done so because the Romans had just discovered
‘the real site of the Cassiterides in N. W. Spain’.<a id="FNanchor_2391" href="#Footnote_2391" class="fnanchor">2391</a> ‘Very little,’ he
remarks, ‘has been found west of Exeter which can be connected
with the first two centuries of the Roman Empire.... Plainly the
Romans of the conquest period did not care to advance beyond
Exeter.... Yet if the tin trade had then been flourishing they would
hardly have stopped. We must put the halt at Exeter beside the
silence of the writers after Caesar, and suppose that for some reason
the tin trade had ceased in Cornwall. Perhaps as iron took the
place of bronze in many lands tin was no longer in such demand;
perhaps the Spanish ore was cheaper than the Cornish; perhaps the
accessible Cornish tin streams seemed exhausted. Whatever the
reason, the Cornish tin trade vanished before <small>A.D.</small> 50. It reappears
two centuries later.’<a id="FNanchor_2392" href="#Footnote_2392" class="fnanchor">2392</a></p>

<p>Now the evidence that Professor Haverfield offers of its having
<i>reappeared</i> is simply the discovery of one inscribed ingot of Cornish
tin, which belonged to the fourth century; and if no inscribed ingots
of an earlier date have been found, their absence hardly proves that
the Romans had not worked the mines before. This Professor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
Haverfield admits; but, he insists, ‘it does prove that we have no
right to say that mining was going on.’<a id="FNanchor_2393" href="#Footnote_2393" class="fnanchor">2393</a> Possibly: but if so, <i>the
absence of inscribed ingots of tin in Spain</i><a id="FNanchor_2394" href="#Footnote_2394" class="fnanchor">2394</a> <i>equally proves that we have
no right to say that mining was going on there</i>. Yet, if it was suspended
in Cornwall, it must have been contemporaneously active in Spain.
It is true that no Roman antiquities of earlier date than the third
century have been found in Cornwall, except some Samian ware and
coins of Trajan and Vespasian;<a id="FNanchor_2395" href="#Footnote_2395" class="fnanchor">2395</a> and it may be true that, as the
professor says, these discoveries ‘prove no Roman influence or
occupation’:<a id="FNanchor_2396" href="#Footnote_2396" class="fnanchor">2396</a> but, on the other hand, Cornwall has very few Roman
antiquities even of the third and fourth centuries,<a id="FNanchor_2397" href="#Footnote_2397" class="fnanchor">2397</a> and no Roman
or Romanized towns or villas.<a id="FNanchor_2398" href="#Footnote_2398" class="fnanchor">2398</a> Is it not then possible that, as
Professor Gowland suggests, the mines were worked throughout the
whole period of the Roman occupation of Britain, but not under
Roman control?<a id="FNanchor_2399" href="#Footnote_2399" class="fnanchor">2399</a> He points out that ‘the stamps had been impressed
[upon the solitary ingot] when the metal was cold, and hence not
necessarily at the mine, but very probably by a Roman trader or
officer at the coast’.<a id="FNanchor_2400" href="#Footnote_2400" class="fnanchor">2400</a> Professor Haverfield indeed states that the
ingot was found not more than a mile and a half from ‘an old working’,
which has yielded Roman coins:<a id="FNanchor_2401" href="#Footnote_2401" class="fnanchor">2401</a> but Professor Gowland supports his
own view by the argument that ‘at the Roman lead mines in Britain
the inscriptions were always cast on the ingots of lead when they
were made, and at the copper mines were stamped on the cakes of
copper while they were red hot’. ‘The real site of the Cassiterides’
was not, as Professor Haverfield thinks, ‘in N. W. Spain,’ but in
the British Isles. ‘The silence of the writers after Caesar’ in regard
to the British trade in tin, on which he lays stress, really resolves
itself into the silence of Strabo; for although the professor is quite
right in saying that ‘later authors [namely, Diodorus, Strabo, and
Pliny] merely include it in quotations from earlier literature’, those
who are familiar with their writings will admit that there was no
reason why any of them, except Strabo, should have expressly added
to those quotations the information that the British tin trade continued
in their own time. We should certainly have expected that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
Strabo would have included tin in his list of British exports if it had
been exported in his time; and I will not attempt to explain away his
silence: but can it outweigh the extreme improbability that for two
centuries the civilized world should have been entirely cut off from
one of the two sources from which its supply of tin had previously
been derived? And when Professor Haverfield suggests that ‘as
iron took the place of bronze in many lands, tin was no longer in
such demand’, does he not momentarily forget that not only in the
lands round the Mediterranean but also in those of Northern and
Western Europe iron had taken the place of bronze for many purposes
several centuries before the Christian era, and that, on the
other hand, those implements and ornaments which were still made
wholly or in part of bronze were probably in greater demand than
before?</p>

<p>IV. We have now to deal with the Phoenicians. Sir George
Cornewall Lewis<a id="FNanchor_2402" href="#Footnote_2402" class="fnanchor">2402</a> and various other writers have endeavoured to
prove that the Phoenicians (including the Carthaginians) never
traded directly with Britain for tin; and in 1896 Dr. Arthur Evans
remarked that ‘the days are gone past when it could be seriously
maintained that the Phoenician merchant landed on the coast of
Cornwall’.<a id="FNanchor_2403" href="#Footnote_2403" class="fnanchor">2403</a></p>

<p>Now Dr. Evans’s distinguished father, who holds that the Cassiterides
‘are rightly identified with Britain’, observes that ‘the
traces of Phoenician influence in this country are ... at present
imperceptible. But,’ he continues, ‘it may well be that their
system of commerce or barter was such as intentionally left the
barbarian tribes with whom they traded in much the same stage of
civilization as that in which they found them, always assuming that
they dealt directly with Britain and not through the intervention of
Gaulish merchants.’<a id="FNanchor_2404" href="#Footnote_2404" class="fnanchor">2404</a></p>

<p>Some merchants certainly landed, if not on the coast of Cornwall
at all events on that of Ictis: is there any reason in the nature of
things why Phoenician merchants should not have done so? To the
old-fashioned view there are only two objections worth considering,
namely, first, that ‘the tin trade was carried on overland through
Gaul’,<a id="FNanchor_2405" href="#Footnote_2405" class="fnanchor">2405</a> and, secondly, that the tin which was shipped to Gades may
have come not from Britain but from the mines of North-Western
Spain. But, as we have seen, there is no evidence that the overland
trade had begun before 600 <small>B.C.</small>,&mdash;the approximate date of the
foundation of Massilia; nor is there any evidence that the Phoenicians
took part in it. From Gades to Cornwall the voyage, as George
Smith observes, was shorter than the voyages ‘from Tyre to Malta,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
Carthage, or Sicily, which they were performing continuously’.<a id="FNanchor_2406" href="#Footnote_2406" class="fnanchor">2406</a>
If Desjardins<a id="FNanchor_2407" href="#Footnote_2407" class="fnanchor">2407</a> is right in affirming that ‘the name <i>Corbilo</i> unquestionably
looks Phoenician’, and that a Phoenician inscription has been
found near Guérande, it may be inferred that the carrying trade
between Britain and Corbilo was at one time either wholly or partly
in Phoenician or Carthaginian hands. That tin was obtained in
ancient times from the mines of North-Western Spain must be
admitted: not only is the fact attested by the statements of Strabo
and Pliny,<a id="FNanchor_2408" href="#Footnote_2408" class="fnanchor">2408</a> but it has been proved by the researches of Mr. W. C.
Borlase.<a id="FNanchor_2409" href="#Footnote_2409" class="fnanchor">2409</a> But there is some evidence that tin also came from Cornwall
to Gades. Festus Avienus<a id="FNanchor_2410" href="#Footnote_2410" class="fnanchor">2410</a> tells us, ultimately, it may be
assumed, on the authority of the Carthaginian traveller, Himilco,
that both the Carthaginians and the people of Gades used to sail to
the British seas.<a id="FNanchor_2411" href="#Footnote_2411" class="fnanchor">2411</a> Sir George Cornewall Lewis,<a id="FNanchor_2412" href="#Footnote_2412" class="fnanchor">2412</a> indeed, argues that
‘if the date of the voyages of Hanno and Himilco is correctly fixed,
it follows that at a period subsequent to the expedition of Xerxes,
the Carthaginians ... had not carried their navigation far along the
coasts of the Atlantic; and that they sent out two voyages of discovery&mdash;one
to the south, the other to the north&mdash;at the public
expense’. All that we know about the date of Himilco’s voyage is
that it was not later than the fifth, probably in the sixth century
B. C.,<a id="FNanchor_2413" href="#Footnote_2413" class="fnanchor">2413</a> and, according to Pliny,<a id="FNanchor_2414" href="#Footnote_2414" class="fnanchor">2414</a> its object was ‘to explore the outer
parts of Europe’. Anyhow the evidence remains that after Himilco’s
time, if not before, the Carthaginians traded by sea with Britain.<a id="FNanchor_2415" href="#Footnote_2415" class="fnanchor">2415</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
Dr. Arthur Evans, I know, warns us that ‘a truer view of primitive
trade as passing on by inter-tribal barter has superseded the idea of
a direct commerce between remote localities’.<a id="FNanchor_2416" href="#Footnote_2416" class="fnanchor">2416</a> But the testimony
of Diodorus, that is to say of Pytheas, proves that traders purchased
tin off the Cornish coast from the natives who had prepared it for
market, carried it across the Channel, and unloaded it on the coast of
Gaul, whence it was conveyed overland to the mouth of the Rhône.
If this was not ‘direct commerce’, what was? That there was
‘inter-tribal barter’ in ancient times, no well-informed person would
deny; but that there was also ‘direct commerce between remote
localities’ is as well attested as any fact of ancient history can be.</p>

<p>Mr. C. T. Newton indeed argues that ‘if the Phoenicians frequented
any portion of the British coast, it is probable that they would have
given names to the more important harbours and promontories, as
they did in Africa and Spain’.<a id="FNanchor_2417" href="#Footnote_2417" class="fnanchor">2417</a> But is it not also probable that they
found it sufficient to hold, or even to occupy temporarily, as occasion
required, one or more of the Scilly Islands, or perhaps St. Michael’s
Mount, and that they may have given names to these places,
although the names have not survived.<a id="FNanchor_2418" href="#Footnote_2418" class="fnanchor">2418</a> Their settlements in Africa
and Spain were not temporary but permanent.</p>

<p>I freely admit that the testimony of Festus Avienus is not conclusive;
but I see no reason for rejecting the statement of Strabo that
the Phoenicians traded directly for tin with the Cassiterides&mdash;that is
to say, the British Isles&mdash;and that they originally monopolized the
trade.</p>

<p>M. Salomon Reinach,<a id="FNanchor_2419" href="#Footnote_2419" class="fnanchor">2419</a> who supports the view that the Phoenicians
traded directly with Cornwall, insists, referring to a well-known
passage in Thucydides,<a id="FNanchor_2420" href="#Footnote_2420" class="fnanchor">2420</a> that the overland route must have been
earlier than the maritime. ‘Corinth,’ says Thucydides, ‘being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
seated on an isthmus, was naturally from the first a centre of commerce;
for the Hellenes within and without the Peloponnese, in the
old days when they communicated chiefly by land, had to pass
through her territory in order to reach one another.’<a id="FNanchor_2421" href="#Footnote_2421" class="fnanchor">2421</a> M. Reinach
argues that ‘nothing could have suggested to the Phoenicians the
idea of going with their ships in search of tin if they had not already
known the existence not only of the metal but also of the distant
country which produced it ... the Phoenicians of Spain no more
discovered the Cassiterides and tin than the Portuguese discovered
India and spices’. This may be freely admitted. But the Phoenicians
may well have acquired the knowledge upon which they acted
long before the direct overland trade which Diodorus describes began.
Tin was probably conveyed in very early times from Cornwall to
Gaul for the use of tribes who inhabited that country before the
immigration of the Celtic-speaking invaders; and, since Gaul was
in communication with Britain from the beginning of the Bronze
Age,<a id="FNanchor_2422" href="#Footnote_2422" class="fnanchor">2422</a> the knowledge that tin was to be obtained in Britain might
have reached Phoenician ears even before Gades was founded.</p>

<p>But the most striking contribution which M. Reinach has made
to the literature of this subject is the suggestion that the traders who
first sailed from the Mediterranean into the English Channel were
not Phoenicians but Phrygians. Speaking of the well-known passage,
which I have already quoted, in which Pliny says that Midacritus was
the first who imported tin from ‘the tin island’,<a id="FNanchor_2423" href="#Footnote_2423" class="fnanchor">2423</a> he argues that the
generally accepted identification of Midacritus with the Phoenician
Melcarth is erroneous. He points out that in Pliny’s list of discoverers
all except the most famous names are accompanied by a complementary
designation, for example (Toxius), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caeli filius</i><a id="FNanchor_2424" href="#Footnote_2424" class="fnanchor">2424</a>. Therefore,
even if, as has been supposed, what Pliny wrote was not
<i>Midacritus</i> but <i>Melicertus</i> (Melcarth), that unfamiliar name would
have been followed by some explanatory addition. M. Reinach then
quotes two passages from Hyginus<a id="FNanchor_2425" href="#Footnote_2425" class="fnanchor">2425</a> and Cassiodorus<a id="FNanchor_2426" href="#Footnote_2426" class="fnanchor">2426</a> respectively.
In the former we read that ‘King Midas, the Phrygian, son of Cybele,
was the first to discover lead and tin’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Midas rex Cybeles filius Phryx
plumbum album et nigrum primus invenit</i>); in the latter, that ‘Midas,
the ruler of Phrygia, discovered tin’ ([Aes enim Ionos Thessaliae
rex], <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plumbum Midas regnator Phrygiae reppererunt</i>). It is clear
then, says M. Reinach, that, as the Jesuit scholar, Hardouin, perceived
more than two centuries ago, for <i>Midacritus</i> in the MSS. of
Pliny we ought to read <cite>Midas Phryx</cite>. He adds that from a fragment
of the Seventh Book of Diodorus, preserved in the Chronicle of
Eusebius, we learn that the maritime supremacy of the Phrygians
began about 903 <small>B.C.</small>, and that of the Phoenicians in 824.<a id="FNanchor_2427" href="#Footnote_2427" class="fnanchor">2427</a>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="PII_Pg515">DENE-HOLES</h2>

<p>Of the various theories which have been published as to the
object of dene-holes three only are worth considering, namely, that
they were granaries; that they were refuges; and that they were
sunk in order to obtain chalk.</p>

<p>Subterranean granaries have of course been used in many countries;<a id="FNanchor_2428" href="#Footnote_2428" class="fnanchor">2428</a>
but it is said that no grain has ever been found in any dene-hole,<a id="FNanchor_2429" href="#Footnote_2429" class="fnanchor">2429</a>
whereas grain has been found in shallow pits and on numerous other
prehistoric sites in Britain.<a id="FNanchor_2430" href="#Footnote_2430" class="fnanchor">2430</a> On the other hand, a thorough exploration
of the famous group of dene-holes in Hangman’s Wood, Essex,
revealed fragments of two millstones.<a id="FNanchor_2431" href="#Footnote_2431" class="fnanchor">2431</a> The Reverend E. H. Goddard
remarks that ‘very similar places’ in Brittany were used by ‘the
peasant armies during the war in La Vendée’ as refuges and lairs,
and argues that dene-holes served a similar purpose.<a id="FNanchor_2432" href="#Footnote_2432" class="fnanchor">2432</a> Perhaps,
though it would have gone hard with the fugitives if their lairs had
been discovered; but, seeing that strongholds were available, it is
difficult to admit that they were dug with that object. The
theory that they were shafts sunk for the extraction of chalk rests
mainly upon the evidence of Pliny, who states that chalk was obtained
in Britain for manure ‘by means of pits sunk like wells with narrow
mouths to the depth commonly of one hundred feet, where they branch
out like the veins of mines’ ([creta] <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">petitur ex alto, in centenos actis
plerumque puteis, ore angustis, intus ut in metallis spatiante vena</i><a id="FNanchor_2433" href="#Footnote_2433" class="fnanchor">2433</a>).
Messrs. T. V. Holmes and W. Cole, who superintended the exploration
of the dene-holes in Hangman’s Wood, argue that ‘the above
account could not have been given to Pliny by any man who had ever
descended into one of our [Essex] ... dene-holes, which are entered
by ... narrow shafts, but whose lofty symmetrical chambers cannot
be described as “branching out like the veins of mines”.’<a id="FNanchor_2434" href="#Footnote_2434" class="fnanchor">2434</a> I think,
on the contrary, that, allowing for the natural inaccuracy of a writer
who gave his own version of information supplied by one who had
perhaps himself not descended into a dene-hole, Pliny’s description
was remarkably correct: the chambers which open out at the
bottom of the shafts in Hangman’s Wood are arranged in the shape
of a star-fish; the only material error with which Pliny can be
charged is that he compared them to the veins of mines; and that
he was alluding to them I have no doubt. Messrs. Holmes and Cole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
are, however, on firm ground when they point out that his informant
may have wrongly assumed that the shafts were sunk in order to
obtain chalk because the chalk that was extracted from them was
utilized. ‘And,’ they continue, ‘a foreigner accidentally discovering
secret pits&mdash;and our surface trenches showed our dene-holes to have
been secret excavations&mdash;would almost necessarily be deceived as
to their use by natives.’ But is it not possible that Pliny’s informant
may have been a Briton? And, assuming that he was deceived as
to the purpose of the dene-holes, why was he allowed to learn
the existence and arrangement of the chambers, and, approximately,
the depth of the shaft?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Messrs. Holmes and Cole are undoubtedly right in
the main. It has been argued that dene-holes are situated in places
which must always have been uncultivated, whereas the tracts in
which chalk lay near the surface may have been already occupied;
that chalk has been obtained in Wiltshire in modern times by mining
although it was to be had near the surface; and that the labour
of sinking the shafts may have been compensated by saving the cost
of transporting chalk from distant parts, where it was the surface
rock.<a id="FNanchor_2435" href="#Footnote_2435" class="fnanchor">2435</a> But, as Messrs. Holmes and Cole observe, ‘there is plenty
of bare chalk within a mile’ of Hangman’s Wood; and, as they
pertinently ask, if the dene-holes were sunk for chalk, why was
their position so carefully kept secret?<a id="FNanchor_2436" href="#Footnote_2436" class="fnanchor">2436</a> Again, Mr. Spurrell, who
admits that where chalk lay very deep shafts may have been sunk
merely in order to obtain it, remarks that ‘it is evident that where
the land is white with chalk the pits of great depth so often found
there could not have been dug for manure, and the natives of Kent
in such situations scout the idea as absurd’.<a id="FNanchor_2437" href="#Footnote_2437" class="fnanchor">2437</a> Messrs. T. E. and R. H.
Forster contend that the elaborate design of the chambers in Hangman’s
Wood is ‘in reality a strong confirmation’ of the truth of
‘the chalk-quarry theory’; for ‘the star-fish-shaped pit ... enables
the miner to win more chalk at one sinking; and if no examples of
it were known, it would be necessary to postulate its existence in
order to supply the missing link between the primitive bell-pit and
the pillared and galleried mine of the kind seen at Chislehurst’.<a id="FNanchor_2438" href="#Footnote_2438" class="fnanchor">2438</a>
But is the ‘bell-pit’ primitive, and is there a link, missing or otherwise?
Anyhow it is incredible that the people of Essex, if they had
undertaken the prodigious labour of sinking 70 shafts simply in
order to obtain better chalk than what they could have found hard by
at the surface, would have contented themselves, after boring through
60 feet of sand and gravel, with ‘the very uppermost [and therefore
worst] chalk’.<a id="FNanchor_2439" href="#Footnote_2439" class="fnanchor">2439</a> As Mr. Holmes remarks,<a id="FNanchor_2440" href="#Footnote_2440" class="fnanchor">2440</a> ‘it must be obvious that
the course which would commend itself to all seekers after superior
chalk would be to begin operations where chalk is at the surface,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>
make a shaft 10 to 20 feet deep, and procure chalk lying at that
depth’; and, while he freely admits that ‘a farmer might naturally
prefer to get chalk at a depth of 60 to 80 feet on his own land
rather than ... from some one else’s pit a mile or two away’, he
emphasizes the absurdity of supposing that ‘any people ... concentrated
their pits where they got the least return for their labour, and
where there was no counterbalancing advantage ... as they must
have done at Hangman’s Wood and Bexley on the Chalk-pit hypothesis’.<a id="FNanchor_2441" href="#Footnote_2441" class="fnanchor">2441</a></p>

<p>Charred wood, bones of animals, and large quantities of coarse
pottery have been found in a dene-hole near Dunstable,<a id="FNanchor_2442" href="#Footnote_2442" class="fnanchor">2442</a> which is
sufficient evidence that some dene-holes were occasionally inhabited.</p>

<p>I conclude that dene-holes were intended to serve as granaries;
that they may have been used occasionally as places of concealment;
and that the chalk which was taken out of them was used, if it was
wanted, for manure. It is significant that their name means ‘<i>Dane</i>-holes’,
that is, hiding-places from the Danes.<a id="FNanchor_2443" href="#Footnote_2443" class="fnanchor">2443</a></p>

<p>The ‘bell-pits’ which have been already mentioned, and which
are sometimes confounded with dene-holes, were undoubtedly made
for the sake of the chalk; and, unlike dene-holes, they were made
broad in order that a large amount of material might be taken out of
them at each haul.<a id="FNanchor_2444" href="#Footnote_2444" class="fnanchor">2444</a></p>

<p>Some of the Kentish dene-holes, if Mr. Goddard is rightly informed,
contained bronze implements;<a id="FNanchor_2445" href="#Footnote_2445" class="fnanchor">2445</a> and those of Essex are almost certainly
post-neolithic.<a id="FNanchor_2446" href="#Footnote_2446" class="fnanchor">2446</a> Some bell-pits are ancient, but I doubt whether
it could be proved that any were pre-Roman: Pitt-Rivers<a id="FNanchor_2447" href="#Footnote_2447" class="fnanchor">2447</a> indeed
believed that it was from the Romans that the Britons learned to use
chalk as top-dressing.</p>

<h2 id="PII_Pg517">THE COAST BETWEEN CALAIS AND THE
SOMME IN THE TIME OF CAESAR</h2>

<p>The question of the period during which the gulf of St. Omer existed
has given rise to much discussion. According to Reclus,<a id="FNanchor_2448" href="#Footnote_2448" class="fnanchor">2448</a> Desjardins,<a id="FNanchor_2449" href="#Footnote_2449" class="fnanchor">2449</a>
and many other writers,<a id="FNanchor_2450" href="#Footnote_2450" class="fnanchor">2450</a> even in the time of Caesar this so-called
gulf, which was really a shallow salt-water ‘mere’, covered the
lowlands north-east of the hills of Artois between Sangatte and
Dunkirk, and extended inland to within a short distance of St. Omer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
No evidence, however, has been adduced to show that it existed at
that time;<a id="FNanchor_2451" href="#Footnote_2451" class="fnanchor">2451</a> and it has been proved by M. J. Gosselet that it did
not exist before the latter part of the third century of our era, for
Gallo-Roman remains, including 2,354 coins, some of which belong
to the time of Postumus, have been found in the area. As M. Gosselet
says,<a id="FNanchor_2452" href="#Footnote_2452" class="fnanchor">2452</a> the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sinus Itius</i> is a mere invention of writers of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>The ancient topography of Wissant, of the estuary of the Liane,

in the article on the Portus Itius.<a id="FNanchor_2453" href="#Footnote_2453" class="fnanchor">2453</a></p>

<p>The inland extension of the bay formed by the estuary of the
Canche has steadily diminished since the time of Caesar; and
whereas, during the last century at all events, the headland on its
southern side has gained considerably on the sea, the ‘Pointe de
Lornel’ on the north and the neighbouring sand-dunes have suffered
continual erosion.<a id="FNanchor_2454" href="#Footnote_2454" class="fnanchor">2454</a></p>

<p>The country which lies between the hills of Artois and the sea,
from the mouth of the Canche to the mouth of the Somme, is, as
Reclus<a id="FNanchor_2455" href="#Footnote_2455" class="fnanchor">2455</a> remarks, of recent formation; and, as late as the ninth century,
the environs of the town of Rue, which is now about six miles
from the sea, were covered by a vast shallow lake, 20,000 hectares, or
about 78 square miles, in extent.</p>

<p>Thanet, as everybody knows, was an island in Caesar’s time; and
Bede<a id="FNanchor_2456" href="#Footnote_2456" class="fnanchor">2456</a> says that it was separated from the mainland by an estuary
three furlongs broad: but the late George Dowker<a id="FNanchor_2457" href="#Footnote_2457" class="fnanchor">2457</a> concluded from
‘an attentive examination of the estuary’ that it was ‘much shallower

Ramsgate southward to Walmer, covering the sites of Stonar and
Sandwich and indeed the whole of the low ground between Sandwich

Burrows ... <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cinque Ports</i>, 1888, p. 30,<a id="FNanchor_2462" href="#Footnote_2462" class="fnanchor">2462</a> says&mdash;“Sandwich and Stonar
are wholly English. No Roman remains have been found at either”
... there is good reason to suppose that the land upon which it
[Sandwich] stands and the land over which the Sandwich end of the
road runs were not formed when the Romans were here.’<a id="FNanchor_2463" href="#Footnote_2463" class="fnanchor">2463</a> And
again, ‘There is another reason for supposing that Each End was ...
the place where the boats left the mainland for the island [of Richborough].
[The road running northward from Dover] is marked on
the Ordnance map<a id="FNanchor_2464" href="#Footnote_2464" class="fnanchor">2464</a> as a Roman road, and if complete would run to
Each End, not to Richborough Castle or to Sandwich ... the last
mile from [Woodnesborough] to Each End, is missing.’<a id="FNanchor_2465" href="#Footnote_2465" class="fnanchor">2465</a></p>

<p>Now, in regard to Stonar, Professor Burrows, as we shall presently
see, is mistaken; and, granting that the Roman road from Dover
would, if complete, run to Each End, how can Mr. Sharpe prove
that it did not run further? The late George Dowker stated, in a
paper which was published after his death, that he had himself
‘traced the Roman road to Woodnesborough, and thence by Each
End to near the Richborough Island’;<a id="FNanchor_2466" href="#Footnote_2466" class="fnanchor">2466</a> and the views of Lewis and
Boys, which Mr. Sharpe endorses, as to the wide extent of the
estuary at the time of the Roman conquest of Britain have been
stultified by discoveries to which Mr. Sharpe does not allude. Roach
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
Smith affirms that ‘Roman remains, indicative of habitations, have
been discovered in the sand-hills considerably to the north of Sandown
Castle’, and that ‘coins have been found at Stonar, opposite to Richborough’;
and from these facts he infers that ‘the recession of
the sea from the low land between Thanet and Walmer probably
commenced at a period much earlier than has been commonly
supposed’.<a id="FNanchor_2467" href="#Footnote_2467" class="fnanchor">2467</a></p>

<p>That the hill on which Richborough Castle stood was nearly if not
quite insulated is generally admitted;<a id="FNanchor_2468" href="#Footnote_2468" class="fnanchor">2468</a> but Mr. George E. Fox
remarks that it ‘was probably not washed by the open sea, though
a broad channel may have flowed close beside it, forming one of the
southern mouths of the strait, while a narrow strip of salt-marsh
and sand-bank lay between it and the open sea’. It would be more
correct to say that the island, on its eastern side, was separated by
a channel from Stonar Beach, the southern extremity of which lay
east by north of the site of Sandwich: the sand-hills were on the
south-eastern side of this beach, from which they were divided by
a narrow channel. Mr. Fox goes on to say that ‘a large extent of
what is now marshland, lying to the west of the hill, may then have ... formed
the haven,<a id="FNanchor_2469" href="#Footnote_2469" class="fnanchor">2469</a> making of the camp hill an island’. He
argues, however, that, on the eastern side, the channel ‘could not
have hugged the hill very closely, as at no great distance to the south
of the station on this same side, and in the low ground presumably
near the shore, fragments of a Roman house were discovered in 1846’.<a id="FNanchor_2470" href="#Footnote_2470" class="fnanchor">2470</a></p>

<p>In the year 1876 Dowker affirmed that ‘the low shore and sand
hills’ which now extend from the Deal beach to the latitude of Sandwich
‘extended [in the time of Caesar] much less than at present’;<a id="FNanchor_2471" href="#Footnote_2471" class="fnanchor">2471</a>
and in a map which accompanied his paper<a id="FNanchor_2472" href="#Footnote_2472" class="fnanchor">2472</a> he contrasted the low-water
line between Walmer and Sandwich, as he believed it to have
existed in 55 <small>B.C.</small>, with the low-water line as it existed at the time
when he wrote. In the latitude of Sandwich the modern low-water
line is traced on this map a mile and a half east of the hypothetical
ancient line, which distance gradually diminishes to three-quarters
of a mile in the latitude of Worth and about one furlong in the latitude
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
of Deal. I find a difficulty in reconciling this map with Dowker’s
own statement that ‘Roman pottery, coins and traces of the Roman
occupation have been found in the sand-hills&mdash;and indeed below the
sand-hills considerably northward of Deal, beyond Sandown Castle’;<a id="FNanchor_2473" href="#Footnote_2473" class="fnanchor">2473</a>
and from the fact which this statement records it follows that, in the
time of the Roman occupation of Britain, the shore-line at the place
where the discoveries in question were made cannot have been widely
different from what it is now.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg521">II. BETWEEN SANDOWN CASTLE AND WALMER CASTLE</h3>

<p>When we endeavour to trace the shore-line, as it existed in Caesar’s
time, opposite Deal and Walmer, we find that the writers who have
dealt with the question differ widely among themselves; while
Dowker again shows himself a most troublesome witness. Unfortunately
this meritorious geologist, who laboured hard to elucidate
the geographical questions connected with the ancient history of
East Kent, was a bad writer, and sometimes failed to make his
meaning clear.</p>

<p>Major Rennell, who was in his day ‘the acknowledged head of
British geographers’,<a id="FNanchor_2474" href="#Footnote_2474" class="fnanchor">2474</a> believed that Caesar landed at Deal. ‘Of
course,’ he says, ‘the margin of the ancient beach, on which Caesar
landed, must now be very far within land, as well as very considerably
raised.’<a id="FNanchor_2475" href="#Footnote_2475" class="fnanchor">2475</a> The words ‘of course’ prepare us for the discovery that
Rennell quotes no authority and gives no reasons.</p>

<p>Professor Montagu Burrows,<a id="FNanchor_2476" href="#Footnote_2476" class="fnanchor">2476</a> also without giving either authority
or reason, tells us that Deal ‘probably had once a haven, which was
choked up in very early times’. But choked up it was not unless it
existed; and observe that its existence is only ‘probable’. As
a matter of fact, the so-called probability is unsupported by any evidence.<a id="FNanchor_2477" href="#Footnote_2477" class="fnanchor">2477</a>
The professor goes on to say that ‘the old town [of Deal]
was already separated from the sea by a considerable interval when
Henry [the Eighth] built the three castles of Deal, Sandown, and
Walmer for the protection of the coast, which had now become a continuous
stretch of steep shingly beach’. Now if, in the time of Henry
the Eighth, ‘the old town was <i>already</i> separated from the sea by a
considerable interval,’ the inference is that it had once been quite
close to the sea; and of this there is no evidence. Was the professor
thinking of Leland,<a id="FNanchor_2478" href="#Footnote_2478" class="fnanchor">2478</a> who describes ‘Deale’ as ‘half a Myle fro the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
Shore of the Se, a Fisshcher Village iii. Myles or more above Sandwic’?
If so, why should he assume that because Deal in the time of Leland,
that is to say, of Henry the Eighth, was half a mile from the sea, it
had once been on the sea? The only conceivable reply to this question
would be that as Upper Deal is now more than half a mile from the
sea,<a id="FNanchor_2479" href="#Footnote_2479" class="fnanchor">2479</a> and as, according to Leland, it was only half a mile from the
sea in the time of Henry, it may once have been actually on the seashore.
But Deal Castle was built by Henry; and the sea was therefore
at least as far from Upper Deal in his time as it is now. The
truth is that Leland’s ‘Myles’ were sometimes very long: he tells us
that Sandwich was ‘iii. Myles’ from Deal, and it is really six.</p>

<p>Dowker, in the paper which he published in 1876,<a id="FNanchor_2480" href="#Footnote_2480" class="fnanchor">2480</a> maintained
that ‘Deal probably did not exist in Roman times’, and that, when
Caesar landed in Britain, ‘the coast was cut back behind Deal’:<a id="FNanchor_2481" href="#Footnote_2481" class="fnanchor">2481</a>
that is to say, he virtually committed himself to agreement with the
view, already stated, of Major Rennell. In the same paper he affirmed
that ‘the present town of Deal is situated on a comparatively recent
beach’, and went on to say, in proof of his assertion, ‘I have evidence
of the beach at the back of Deal containing mediaeval remains.’<a id="FNanchor_2482" href="#Footnote_2482" class="fnanchor">2482</a>
What the evidence was, he did not say; and what he meant by
‘the beach at the back of Deal’, I do not know. In 1887 another
paper<a id="FNanchor_2483" href="#Footnote_2483" class="fnanchor">2483</a> was published, containing a report of his views. Herein I
find that there is ‘no evidence’ of ‘a shore-line cutting far back
beyond the Deal beach’. No evidence in 1887, though in 1876 the
evidence was irrefragable.<a id="FNanchor_2484" href="#Footnote_2484" class="fnanchor">2484</a></p>

<p>The opinion of Stukeley,<a id="FNanchor_2485" href="#Footnote_2485" class="fnanchor">2485</a> who believed that Caesar had landed
between Walmer Castle and Deal, was diametrically opposed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
that of Rennell. He maintained that Caesar’s camps must have
been ‘absorpt by the ocean, which has so long been ... wasting the
land away’. ‘Even since Henry the VIII<sup>ths</sup> time,’ he continued,
‘it has carried off the seaward esplanade of the three castles’ [of
Walmer, Deal, and Sandown].<a id="FNanchor_2486" href="#Footnote_2486" class="fnanchor">2486</a> But it does not follow that in
the interval which separated the time of Caesar from the time
of Henry the Eighth the sea in the neighbourhood of Deal had
been continuously gaining upon the land. It would appear that
in the last four centuries it has alternately advanced a little
and receded.<a id="FNanchor_2487" href="#Footnote_2487" class="fnanchor">2487</a> In 1615, 1626, and 1627 the waves were wearing
away the walls which had been erected for the protection of the
castles of Walmer and Deal.<a id="FNanchor_2488" href="#Footnote_2488" class="fnanchor">2488</a> During the latter half of the eighteenth
century, however, shingle was being rapidly thrown up along the
coast between St. Margaret’s Bay and a point which, as Mr. Elvin<a id="FNanchor_2489" href="#Footnote_2489" class="fnanchor">2489</a>
says, was ‘considerably to the north of Sandown Castle’; and,
although during the first thirty years of the nineteenth century the
sea was again encroaching, at all events at Walmer, the bank of
shingle between the Rifle Range at Kingsdown and Walmer then
began again to increase, while northward of Deal as far as Sandown
Castle the sea was simultaneously gaining ground. In 1885 shingle
was still accumulating at Walmer Castle and also at Deal, although
it was recognized that at the latter place its movements were variable.
For some years previously, however, the shingle which formerly
protected the cliffs between St. Margaret’s and Kingsdown had been
travelling northwards past Walmer to Deal; and during the fourteen
years that followed 1885 the same process was going on: I daresay
it is going on still. At Deal, wrote Dowker in 1899,<a id="FNanchor_2490" href="#Footnote_2490" class="fnanchor">2490</a> ‘the shore line
has been nearly stationary until we approach the north end of Deal,
where the ... sea had washed most of the beach away and carried
it past the Castle.’ Finally, it must be borne in mind that from
various places between Walmer and the North Foreland a great deal
of shingle has been abstracted.<a id="FNanchor_2491" href="#Footnote_2491" class="fnanchor">2491</a> Still, if <i>The North West View of
Walmer Castle</i>, by S. and N. Buck, which was published in 1735, was
approximately accurate, the sea was a good deal nearer the castle
then than it is now; and the observations that were made between
1741 and 1884 show that while in that period the sea at Sandown
Castle gained 200 feet upon the land, off Deal Castle the increase of
shingle amounted to 120 feet, and off Walmer Castle to no less than
385.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span></p>

<p>The Reverend Beale Poste, a well-known antiquary of the nineteenth
century, maintained<a id="FNanchor_2492" href="#Footnote_2492" class="fnanchor">2492</a> that the bank of beach upon which
Deal stands must have existed in the time of Caesar, ‘since numerous
Roman coins are found at neap tides at low water on the chalk
at the edge of the beach.’ He added that ‘when the piles for
the pier were driven into the beach in 1842, it was found in a
highly concrete state, almost like rock, denoting great antiquity’.
The former statement, if it is correct,<a id="FNanchor_2493" href="#Footnote_2493" class="fnanchor">2493</a> would seem to prove that the
shore-line has receded, in other words, that the sea has on the whole
gained upon the land since the days of Caesar; the argument based
upon the condition of the beach into which the piles were driven
only tends to show that the lower stratum of the beach was old.</p>

<p>Quite recently a discovery has been made which ought to set the
question at rest. Romano-British interments have been unearthed
about seven hundred yards north of Walmer Castle, ‘on the low
ground ... adjoining, and only on a slightly higher level than the
Castle meadows.’<a id="FNanchor_2494" href="#Footnote_2494" class="fnanchor">2494</a> The spot where they lay is about two hundred
and fifty feet west of the high-water mark of ordinary tides. The
discovery, as Mr. Cumberland Woodruff remarks,<a id="FNanchor_2495" href="#Footnote_2495" class="fnanchor">2495</a> proves that ‘the
shore lands [between Walmer and Deal] were protected then as now,
though probably [or rather certainly] by a much thinner line of
shingle’.<a id="FNanchor_2496" href="#Footnote_2496" class="fnanchor">2496</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span></p>

<p>The conclusion appears to be this. There is no reason to suppose
that the coast-line between Sandown Castle and Walmer Castle was
very different in Caesar’s time from that which is depicted on the
Ordnance Map; and there is positive proof that between Walmer
Castle and Deal Castle, at some period of the Roman occupation, it
was nearly the same. On the other hand, it is certain that since
Caesar landed a great deal of shingle has accumulated along this part
of the coast, especially at Walmer; and it may be inferred that the
beach was less steep then than it is now.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg525">III. THE GOODWIN SANDS</h3>

<p>Before we attempt to inquire what was the condition of the
Goodwin Sands in the time of Caesar, it will be well to state the relevant
facts which have been ascertained since exact observations
began to be recorded.</p>

<p>‘The north-eastern part of the North Goodwin,’ says the author
of the <i>Channel Pilot</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2497" href="#Footnote_2497" class="fnanchor">2497</a> ‘dries in places 7 feet at low water; the
South Goodwin not more than 4 or 5 feet at any part.’</p>

<p>The form of the sands is altered periodically by the tides. Beale
Poste argued in 1857 that the Goodwin Sands were still growing,
as ‘Kingsdown Mark, a pile ... built in the reign of Elizabeth to
show the South Sand head, is ... of no use, the sand having now
extended itself a mile further to the southward’. Moreover, he says,
it was stated in the Report of the Commission of the Harbours of
Refuge for 1845 that ‘the Brake Sand, a branch of the Goodwin
Sands in the Small Downs, had moved <i>bodily inwards</i> towards the
shore seven hundred yards within the last fifty years’. This, he
maintains, can only mean that ‘a deposit has taken place on the
inward side of the sand ... while the outward side has been eroded
by the winds and tides’.<a id="FNanchor_2498" href="#Footnote_2498" class="fnanchor">2498</a> In 1885 it was found that ‘the former
Bunthead shoal’ had ‘entirely disappeared’,<a id="FNanchor_2499" href="#Footnote_2499" class="fnanchor">2499</a> and that ‘the whole
body of the South Calliper’ had ‘moved about a mile north-eastward’.
Again, it was ascertained by ‘a re-survey of the Downs,
Goodwin Sands, and adjacent coast’, executed in 1896, that since
1887 considerable changes had taken place. ‘The Goodwin Sand,’
we learn from this source, ‘has continued its general movement
towards the coast, and the area of drying sand has largely increased.’<a id="FNanchor_2500" href="#Footnote_2500" class="fnanchor">2500</a></p>

<p>The results of borings carried out at various times in the Goodwin
Sands have shown that blue clay, resting on chalk, was found at the
depths of 7, 15, 57, and 78 feet.<a id="FNanchor_2501" href="#Footnote_2501" class="fnanchor">2501</a> From these data Sir Charles Lyell<a id="FNanchor_2502" href="#Footnote_2502" class="fnanchor">2502</a>
concludes that the Goodwins ‘are a remnant of land, and not “a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
mere accumulation of sea sand”;’ and, referring to the destructive
storm mentioned in the <cite>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</cite><a id="FNanchor_2503" href="#Footnote_2503" class="fnanchor">2503</a> as having occurred
in 1099, he conjectures that ‘the last remains of an island, consisting,
like Sheppey, of clay, may perhaps have been carried away about
that time’.</p>

<p>Dr. Guest<a id="FNanchor_2504" href="#Footnote_2504" class="fnanchor">2504</a> holds that in Caesar’s time the Goodwin Sands did not
exist. He reminds us that, according to Somner,<a id="FNanchor_2505" href="#Footnote_2505" class="fnanchor">2505</a> it was the opinion
of ‘several men of judgement’ that they had not appeared until
after the time of Earl Godwin, and, remarking that this was also the
view of Sir Thomas More, he argues that ‘we may infer that such
at that period was the opinion of educated men who had local knowledge’.
Leland,<a id="FNanchor_2506" href="#Footnote_2506" class="fnanchor">2506</a> he goes on to say, ‘attributed the decay of Sandwich
to the Goodwin Sands, and as Sandwich was a flourishing port in
the fourteenth century, we may infer that it was not till the fifteenth
that the sands attained those formidable dimensions which produced
so much mischief.’ Immediately north of Sandown Castle there is,
he observes, a tract of land covered with low sand-hills, which, in
Philipot’s map of Kent, are called the ‘smale downs’,<a id="FNanchor_2507" href="#Footnote_2507" class="fnanchor">2507</a> and upon
which the sea has long been encroaching. He accounts for the name
given to the roadstead by assuming that it once formed part of the
‘smale downs’, and affirms his belief that ‘the flats round Sandwich
once projected into the sea as a low ness or foreland,&mdash;probably
divided into islands, of which Lomea [an island which John Twine
asserted to have formerly existed about four miles from Thanet] was
the easternmost’. He assumes that as Lomea is not mentioned in
Domesday Book, it perished by some natural convulsion before the
end of the eleventh century, and goes on to say that ‘After the destruction
of this island, the Goodwin Sands may have been gradually
accumulated, not necessarily on the site of the island, but near it,
and the Downs just as gradually excavated’.<a id="FNanchor_2508" href="#Footnote_2508" class="fnanchor">2508</a> Beale Poste<a id="FNanchor_2509" href="#Footnote_2509" class="fnanchor">2509</a> also
affirms that in 1098 ‘an island named Lomea was overflowed, on
which occasion the sands are said to have been formed. This is
mentioned by Giraldus Cambrensis, and from him by Twine.... But
Earl Goodwin (<i>sic</i>) died in ... 1053, and Domesday-book negatives
that any extensive tract of land was overflowed and lost, in this
direction.’</p>

<p>Now John Twine<a id="FNanchor_2510" href="#Footnote_2510" class="fnanchor">2510</a> (or Twyne) merely says that he has read about
Lomea in the works of ‘certain writers’. It was once, he says, a
low fertile island, which was submerged in consequence of a great
storm, and covered with sand, and it is now the Goodwin Sands.
As for Giraldus Cambrensis, I have searched his writings diligently,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
and I can find no mention whatever therein either of Lomea<a id="FNanchor_2511" href="#Footnote_2511" class="fnanchor">2511</a> or of
the Goodwin Sands. The name ‘Downs’ is easily accounted for.
‘The <small>DOWNS</small>,’ says the author of the <cite>Channel Pilot</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_2512" href="#Footnote_2512" class="fnanchor">2512</a> ‘in a general sense,
implies the numerous banks lying immediately off the coast between
the South and North Forelands ... that [anchorage] which is commonly ... known
as the Downs is off the town of Deal between
Walmer Castle and the northern part of the town,’ &amp;c. I see no
reason to doubt that the name of the roadstead is derived from the
aforesaid banks and from the sand-<i>dunes</i> on the shore.</p>

<p>Somner,<a id="FNanchor_2513" href="#Footnote_2513" class="fnanchor">2513</a> remarking that, according to the common opinion,
Lomea was submerged in 1097, observes that there is no notice of
such an island either in Domesday Book or in ‘any Author whether
foreign or domestick, of any antiquity, that ever I could meet with’.</p>

<p>The late C. H. Pearson<a id="FNanchor_2514" href="#Footnote_2514" class="fnanchor">2514</a> inferred from ‘the legend of their formation’<a id="FNanchor_2515" href="#Footnote_2515" class="fnanchor">2515</a>
that the sands were ‘first remarked about the end of the
eleventh century’, and that they were ‘probably formed by bank-currents
gradually depositing sand about a shoal’.</p>

<p>On the other hand, S. Pritchard,<a id="FNanchor_2516" href="#Footnote_2516" class="fnanchor">2516</a> the historian, so called, of Deal,
argues that the sands must have existed ‘from all time’ as otherwise
Deal and the adjoining country would inevitably have been inundated.
Why? The island, the former existence of which is assumed by
Sir Charles Lyell, would have been as good a protection as the sands;
and in the time, which was certainly anterior to the Roman invasion
of Britain, when the shingle bank had not accumulated to a sufficient
height,<a id="FNanchor_2517" href="#Footnote_2517" class="fnanchor">2517</a> the very small area in the neighbourhood of Deal which is
below high-water mark may have been inundated, unless, as Dowker<a id="FNanchor_2518" href="#Footnote_2518" class="fnanchor">2518</a>
and Mr. Spurrell<a id="FNanchor_2519" href="#Footnote_2519" class="fnanchor">2519</a> believe, the level of the land has been depressed
since the Roman occupation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span></p>

<p>The reader has doubtless already concluded that it is impossible
to affirm either that the Goodwin Sands existed in the time of Caesar,
or that they had not then accumulated to such a degree as to attract
attention, or that their place was occupied by an island. If the
silence of Domesday Book and, as it should seem, the absence of any
other positive testimony constitutes an argument against the hypothesis
of Sir Charles Lyell,<a id="FNanchor_2520" href="#Footnote_2520" class="fnanchor">2520</a> the same argument may be advanced to
show that before the Norman Conquest the sands had not begun to
appear. Yet, as we shall see in a subsequent article, there is some
reason to believe that either sands or an island were there when
Caesar invaded Britain.<a id="FNanchor_2521" href="#Footnote_2521" class="fnanchor">2521</a> Tradition, vague as it is, combined with
Lyell’s authority, disposes me to accept tentatively the latter
alternative.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg528">IV. THE SOUTH FORELAND AND THE DOVER CLIFFS</h3>

<p>Professor Montagu Burrows<a id="FNanchor_2522" href="#Footnote_2522" class="fnanchor">2522</a> affirms that ‘the space over which
the tides travel [in the Straits of Dover] must be at least two miles
wider than it was some 2,000 years ago’. This is one of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedra</i>
statements in which the professor’s work abounds, and for proof of
which his amazed readers search his pages in vain. Dowker’s
estimate is more moderate: he only bids us ‘assume the Straits are
now one mile wider than when Caesar visited our shores’;<a id="FNanchor_2523" href="#Footnote_2523" class="fnanchor">2523</a> but,
like Professor Burrows, he requires us to make this assumption in the
dark.</p>

<p>In M. Vivien de St.-Martin’s great work it is stated that Cape
Grisnez ‘perd en moyenne 25 centim. par an; autrement dit, il
recule 25 m. par siècle’.<a id="FNanchor_2524" href="#Footnote_2524" class="fnanchor">2524</a> Assuming the accuracy of this statement,
and assuming, further, that the rate of erosion has been constant
since the invasion of Caesar, Cape Grisnez then projected seaward
489 metres, or about 534 yards further than it does now. I take for
granted that the statement is based upon exact and prolonged
observation; but when did that observation begin?<a id="FNanchor_2525" href="#Footnote_2525" class="fnanchor">2525</a></p>

<p>As for the South Foreland, it is certain that, as Dowker says,<a id="FNanchor_2526" href="#Footnote_2526" class="fnanchor">2526</a> it
is (or at all events was in 1885 and for some years previously) ‘being
gradually undermined by the sea’; but it would be a great mistake
to leap to the conclusion that this erosion has been going on continuously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
since the time of Caesar. In 1850 Captain K. B. Martin,
who was harbour-master of Ramsgate, affirmed that the cliff between
Dover and the South Foreland, being protected by ‘an inclined
plane of shingle’ from the sea, had ‘preserved its contour from time
immemorial’.<a id="FNanchor_2527" href="#Footnote_2527" class="fnanchor">2527</a> The phrase is somewhat vague: but the captain was
a careful observer; and we may believe him when he tells us that
since his boyhood, fifty years before the time when he wrote, there
had been no change.<a id="FNanchor_2528" href="#Footnote_2528" class="fnanchor">2528</a> Why, then, were the Dover cliffs and the
South Foreland being gradually eaten away in 1876, when Dowker
wrote, and in 1884? Simply because the supply of shingle had, from
various causes, been cut off.<a id="FNanchor_2529" href="#Footnote_2529" class="fnanchor">2529</a> The erosion, said Mr. E. R. N. Druce,
Engineer to the Government pier at Dover, takes place ‘at no particular
rate, but falls of cliff at the points above named have taken
place at intervals for some years past ... since they have lost the
protection of the shingle at their base’. He added that the loss was
‘confined to areas bare of shingle’, and that, so far as he could
ascertain, there existed no ‘data for determining the rate of erosion
from early maps or other documents’.<a id="FNanchor_2530" href="#Footnote_2530" class="fnanchor">2530</a> It would appear, then, that
Professor Burrows’s assertion is based upon pure imagination.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span></p>

<p>When the subsidence which had taken place in the Neolithic Age
was virtually complete the sea was bordered by a narrow plain, to
which the high ground descended gradually. Erosion was at first
rapid while the waters were devouring loose talus; but when beaches
had had time to form it was of course retarded.<a id="FNanchor_2531" href="#Footnote_2531" class="fnanchor">2531</a> How slow it is
where the rocks are hard is proved by the fact that the contour of
a prehistoric camp near Hastings shows that the seaward defence
was formed not by an artificial rampart but by the East Cliff.<a id="FNanchor_2532" href="#Footnote_2532" class="fnanchor">2532</a>
Yet Professor Burrows asks us to believe that erosion has been as
rapid in the chalk of the South Foreland as in the soft cliffs between
Flamborough Head and the Thames.<a id="FNanchor_2533" href="#Footnote_2533" class="fnanchor">2533</a> Generally speaking, as
erosion proceeds, cliffs become higher;<a id="FNanchor_2534" href="#Footnote_2534" class="fnanchor">2534</a> and it is obvious that if the
Channel had been two miles wider in Caesar’s time, the Dover cliffs,
if they had existed, would have been insignificant. But since Caesar
described them as ‘precipitous heights’,<a id="FNanchor_2535" href="#Footnote_2535" class="fnanchor">2535</a> and Cicero as ‘astonishing
masses of cliff’,<a id="FNanchor_2536" href="#Footnote_2536" class="fnanchor">2536</a> they were evidently little lower then than now.
Let the reader ponder these things, and he will realize how monstrously
exaggerated is the estimate which assigns to the Straits
of Caesar’s time a breadth two miles less than our modern maps
show.<a id="FNanchor_2537" href="#Footnote_2537" class="fnanchor">2537</a></p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg530">V. DOVER HARBOUR</h3>

<p>That a natural harbour existed at Dover in the time of Caesar is
beyond dispute. It is mentioned under the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Portus Dubris</i>
in the <cite>Itinerary</cite> of Antonine;<a id="FNanchor_2538" href="#Footnote_2538" class="fnanchor">2538</a> and it was connected by a Roman road
with Canterbury and London, and also with Richborough. Napoleon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
the Third<a id="FNanchor_2539" href="#Footnote_2539" class="fnanchor">2539</a> affirms that it was entirely choked up about 950 <small>A.D.</small>;
but this is a blunder, for the harbour is mentioned in Domesday Book.<a id="FNanchor_2540" href="#Footnote_2540" class="fnanchor">2540</a>
Even as late as 1582 it was stated by an engineer, named Thomas
Digges, that ‘Before the peere was builte out, there are men alyue
can remember that was no banckes or shelues of beache to be seene
before Douer,<a id="FNanchor_2541" href="#Footnote_2541" class="fnanchor">2541</a> but all cleane sea betwene Arteclif [Archcliff] tower
and the castle clyffe’.<a id="FNanchor_2542" href="#Footnote_2542" class="fnanchor">2542</a> Captain Martin<a id="FNanchor_2543" href="#Footnote_2543" class="fnanchor">2543</a> holds that the remains of
anchors which have been dug up out of meadows in the valley
prove that the estuary was navigable as far as Crabble;<a id="FNanchor_2544" href="#Footnote_2544" class="fnanchor">2544</a> and he
believes that it actually extended to Water’s End,<a id="FNanchor_2545" href="#Footnote_2545" class="fnanchor">2545</a> and covered the
sites of the villages of Charlton and Buckland. Canon Puckle, however,
argues that ‘the primitive haven’ covered a space which
extended barely a quarter of a mile inland, ‘bounded by the lower
half of St. James’ Street, Dolphin Lane, and Russell Street, and the
east end of Dolphin Lane,’<a id="FNanchor_2546" href="#Footnote_2546" class="fnanchor">2546</a> and he states that when this area was
‘partly uncovered in excavating for the new Russell Street gas
works, quays and hawser-rings were brought to light’. Captain
Martin’s estimate, which is based upon very uncertain data, must
be regarded as an exaggeration: the estuary may possibly have extended
up to Crabble, but was certainly not navigable so far except
perhaps by coracles. Many years ago the remains of a Roman bath
were discovered on the site of St. Mary’s church,<a id="FNanchor_2547" href="#Footnote_2547" class="fnanchor">2547</a> and in 1887 a
statue belonging to the period of the Roman occupation was found
‘during excavations for the foundation of the Carlton Club, in the
Market Place’.<a id="FNanchor_2548" href="#Footnote_2548" class="fnanchor">2548</a> These discoveries help to define approximately the
western limit of the harbour; and I believe that Planche 17 of the
Atlas accompanying Napoleon’s <cite>Histoire de Jules César</cite><a id="FNanchor_2549" href="#Footnote_2549" class="fnanchor">2549</a> represents
it with tolerable accuracy.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg531">VI. BETWEEN DOVER AND SANDGATE</h3>

<p>During the last three centuries, at all events, the coast between
Sandgate and Dover has undergone considerable changes. Large
quantities of stone have been removed from the Folkestone cliffs; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
landslips have occurred at Shakespeare’s Cliff, between Folkestone and
Sandgate, and behind East Wear Bay.<a id="FNanchor_2550" href="#Footnote_2550" class="fnanchor">2550</a> It would be useless, however,
for our purpose, to describe these changes in detail; for they do not
affect the topographical questions that belong to the history of
Caesar’s invasions of Britain. Excepting the disappearance of the
little haven that once existed at Folkestone, the general character of
this section of the coast was much the same in 55 <small>B.C.</small> as to-day. It
may be, however, that the aspect of the high ground above East
Wear Bay was different. Between the cliffs and the heights which
rise about a quarter of a mile to the north of them there is a wild and
broken plateau, called the Warren, through which the railway
runs. Referring to this, William Phillips, a geologist of some repute,
wrote in 1821, ‘The cliff, bounding this ruin towards the sea, is, from
its position, not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i>; and it is equally clear that the enormous
masses of which it is composed, have fallen forward [probably by
‘repeated falls’] from near the summit of the cliff <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_2551" href="#Footnote_2551" class="fnanchor">2551</a> When
these convulsions began to transform the landscape cannot, as far
as I know, be ascertained.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg532">VII. ROMNEY MARSH</h3>

<p>Between Hythe and Dungeness, on the other hand, there has
been complete transformation. There, within the brief span of
historical time, wind, tide, and river, and finally the labour of man,
have wrought changes as remarkable as those that in other regions
required the lapse of ages which the imagination fails to conceive.
The antiquary who walks from Westenhanger Station to the brow of
Lympne Hill, and looks out over the vast field of shingle that extends
seaward, and, on his left, towards Hythe, and then over the broad
level of the marsh that stretches away on his right between the
Wealden upland and Dymchurch Wall, will easily picture to himself
the scene that once was there.</p>

<p>1. Before we attempt to construct a map which may represent
the coast-line between Sandgate and Dungeness, as it was in the
time of Caesar, it will be well to state those relevant facts which are
accepted by all geographers. There was a time when the area of
Romney Marsh was covered by a bay. At a later epoch the marsh
was fringed by a bar of shingle, which extended from Winchelsea to a
point nearly opposite Shorncliffe. Between West Hythe and
Shorncliffe streams flowed down from the hills, gradually forced an
opening in the shingle opposite Hythe, through which the sea entered,
and thus formed Hythe harbour, which, after remaining open for
many centuries, was finally choked up about 300 years ago. For
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>
some time after the marsh became habitable the shingle protected it
from the sea on the south, but gradually was so diminished that it
became necessary to construct a sea wall. The river Rother debouched
at some point within the area of Romney Marsh. During
the Roman occupation of Britain there was a harbour called the
Portus Lemanis, which has been located by one writer at Romney
and by others at Lympne, while some have identified it with Hythe
Haven. West of West Hythe Oaks, the marsh ‘is a rich mould ... while
all to the east, as far as Sandgate, is (with the exception of a
narrow strip to the south and east of Hythe, between the sea-beach
and the hills) one vast bed of shingle’.<a id="FNanchor_2552" href="#Footnote_2552" class="fnanchor">2552</a></p>

<p>2. The whole of Romney Marsh, properly so called,<a id="FNanchor_2553" href="#Footnote_2553" class="fnanchor">2553</a> is even now
below the level of high water at spring tides. The hills which form
its northern boundary have themselves changed since the time when
the waves broke against their base. In the course of ages they
have lost their original sharpness of outline, and, as we learn from
the geologist who has described the formation of the Weald, have
been ‘worn down into undulating ground’;<a id="FNanchor_2554" href="#Footnote_2554" class="fnanchor">2554</a> and nearly 200 years
ago a local observer described how, after an unusually wet season,
Lympne Hill had been completely transformed, in a single night, by
a landslip.<a id="FNanchor_2555" href="#Footnote_2555" class="fnanchor">2555</a> But these changes are insignificant in comparison with
that by which the old Bay of Appledore has become a fertile pasture.
Of what material is this land composed? According to the late
Thomas Lewin, it is ‘absolutely and exclusively a sea deposit’; and,
in proof of this assertion, he pointed to ‘the marine shells which
pervade the whole mass’.<a id="FNanchor_2556" href="#Footnote_2556" class="fnanchor">2556</a> But it needs little acumen to see that
the presence of marine shells in the marsh does not justify Lewin
in using the words ‘absolutely and exclusively’; and the late Colonel
George Greenwood maintained that the marsh had been formed by
material brought down from the Weald by ‘the aqueous erosion
of the Rother’.<a id="FNanchor_2557" href="#Footnote_2557" class="fnanchor">2557</a> As a matter of fact, it was formed by the combined
action of river and sea.<a id="FNanchor_2558" href="#Footnote_2558" class="fnanchor">2558</a> But unless and until a series of borings are
systematically made, it will be impossible to describe the recent
strata with precision.<a id="FNanchor_2559" href="#Footnote_2559" class="fnanchor">2559</a></p>

<p>According to Topley, ‘The cause of the original formation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>
Romney Marsh is altogether unknown. It is usually attributed to
“the meeting of the tides”; but as this takes place over a rather wide
area, and as shingle beaches and alluvial flats occur where no tides
meet, the explanation is not altogether satisfactory.’<a id="FNanchor_2560" href="#Footnote_2560" class="fnanchor">2560</a> The well-known
geologist, F. Drew, explains that as soon as the bay had
become so shallow from the accumulation of silt that its bed was
exposed at low water, the sediment carried down by the Rother
began to be deposited on the surface. Like Topley, he confesses
that how the silt had accumulated is ‘not quite clear’; and he
thinks that ‘the newly formed surface’ may have been ‘actually
upheaved by oscillation of level, forming a plain well raised above
the level of the sea’,<a id="FNanchor_2561" href="#Footnote_2561" class="fnanchor">2561</a> which, however, before the historic period,
must have suffered a subsidence.<a id="FNanchor_2562" href="#Footnote_2562" class="fnanchor">2562</a> This supposition was based upon
the fact that trees are found near Appledore a few feet below the
surface, which, if they are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i>, must have grown at a time when
the marsh was above the level of the sea, and were perhaps contemporaneous
with the submerged forests of Devonshire and Cornwall.<a id="FNanchor_2563" href="#Footnote_2563" class="fnanchor">2563</a>
Some authorities, however, as we shall presently see, hold<a id="FNanchor_2564" href="#Footnote_2564" class="fnanchor">2564</a>
that they were drifted into their present position.</p>

<p>The late James Elliott, who in the middle of the nineteenth century
was engineer of Dymchurch Wall, diligently investigated the
history of the marsh, and added much to our knowledge. While
the marsh was being formed it was gradually closed by a bar of
shingle, composed of pebbles which had been partly broken off
from the cliffs on the south-west, partly carried down by rivers,<a id="FNanchor_2565" href="#Footnote_2565" class="fnanchor">2565</a> and
had been driven up the Channel by the prevailing winds.<a id="FNanchor_2566" href="#Footnote_2566" class="fnanchor">2566</a> Elliott
remarks that ‘the result of such a protection from the open sea
would be, that all matter brought down by the hills would rest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>
nearly where it was first deposited, and, in process of time, dry land,
at certain states of the tide, would appear’; and that, on the ebb
of every tide, ‘all the water in the bay gradually receded towards the
hills, and ... made its exit at the eastern end of the shingle bank.’<a id="FNanchor_2567" href="#Footnote_2567" class="fnanchor">2567</a>
He concludes that the shingle extended rapidly until it reached the
eastern end of what is now Dymchurch Wall, but that its progress
thenceforward was extremely slow. Meanwhile the sediment deposited
by the sea was gradually raising the surface of the marsh.<a id="FNanchor_2568" href="#Footnote_2568" class="fnanchor">2568</a>
Elliott, whose statements and opinions were incorporated by Lewin
in his book on the invasions of Caesar, affirms that the advancing
shingle spit was ‘intersected only by a channel between Lydd and
Romney’, which was ‘the mouth of the estuary which lay behind
the shingle’;<a id="FNanchor_2569" href="#Footnote_2569" class="fnanchor">2569</a> but Lewin, in a later article on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Portus Lemanis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2570" href="#Footnote_2570" class="fnanchor">2570</a>
appears to have abandoned this view, for he there implies that the
spit was continuous. At some period which preceded the erection
of the Rhee Wall, that is to say, the first enclosure or ‘inning’ of
the marsh, it would appear to have reached the foot of the hills at
West Hythe Oaks.<a id="FNanchor_2571" href="#Footnote_2571" class="fnanchor">2571</a> The result, according to Lewin, was that the
marsh was temporarily enclosed. But, he says, ‘this bar to the exit
of waters from the marsh could not long continue, for, though the
sea was excluded, the Limen [that is to say, the Rother] ... and
twenty smaller streams were continually increasing the volume of
water within the marsh, and ... the shingle spit was burst asunder
between Romney and Lydd.’ Thus, if Lewin’s final view is correct,
the sea again found an entrance on the west of Romney, and continued
to overflow the marsh at high tide until it was finally shut out by
the erection of the Rhee Wall. West Hythe Oaks was not the final
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>
goal of the shingle spit. For a long period, as Lewin remarks, ‘the
shingle from the west continued to advance ... and for a time without
again touching the hills;’ but at length the advancing spit ‘was
again wrested aside and dashed against the hills at Hythe, between
the present barracks and the more eastern of the two Hythe bridges
over the canal’. According to Elliott, however, whose view was
adopted by Lewin in the Appendix to his book on the invasion of
Britain by Caesar, the shingle was not ‘dashed against the hills at
Hythe’, but opposite Shorncliffe. Anyhow the final result was
that from the eastern end of what is now Dymchurch Wall to a point
nearly opposite Shorncliffe there extended an irregular tract of shingle,
broken only opposite Hythe by an opening, which led to a narrow
harbour extending along the foot of the hills. This opening was
due to the streams which flowed down from the hills and found
a vent by bursting the barrier of shingle, and the scour of which kept
the harbour open until, about three hundred years ago, it was finally
choked up. According to Elliott, the western extremity of this
harbour was at West Hythe Oaks; according to Lewin’s final view
at Hythe itself. Between Dymchurch and Hythe the shingle formed
a broad field; but the section between Hythe and Shorncliffe, which
formed the southern boundary of Hythe harbour, was long and narrow.
The whole tract was ‘perfectly flat and <i>above high-water mark</i>’; and
Elliott argues that it extended much further seaward in Caesar’s
time than it does now, because, while the supply of shingle drifted
from the south-west was cut off by the gradual elongation of Dungeness,
the eastward movement of the shingle along the fringe of the
marsh still went on.<a id="FNanchor_2572" href="#Footnote_2572" class="fnanchor">2572</a> This argument he supports by a comparison of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
the Ordnance Survey map executed in 1817 with an old map of the
marsh, probably made about the year 1550, which is in the Cottonian
MSS.<a id="FNanchor_2573" href="#Footnote_2573" class="fnanchor">2573</a> at the British Museum. Assuming the accuracy of the old
map, it would appear that in the 267 years the shingle had receded
about two furlongs; and Elliott concluded that in Caesar’s time the
coast line at Hythe must have been nearly a mile from the hills.
Having had considerable experience in the handling of old maps,
I so far differ from Elliott that I am rather disposed to assume the
inaccuracy of the one on which he relies; but he is quite justified in
concluding that the coast line was much further from the Hythe
hills in 55 <small>B.C.</small> than now.<a id="FNanchor_2574" href="#Footnote_2574" class="fnanchor">2574</a></p>

<p>Elliott’s account of the formation of the Marsh has, however, been
recently disputed in a paper by George Dowker,<a id="FNanchor_2575" href="#Footnote_2575" class="fnanchor">2575</a> which, although it
swarms with bibliographical and historical mistakes,<a id="FNanchor_2576" href="#Footnote_2576" class="fnanchor">2576</a> cannot safely
be ignored. The author begins by endeavouring to show that the
Rother originally entered the sea at Romney; that it gradually
raised both its bed and its banks by depositing sediment; and that
‘the Rhee Wall was, in the first place, a natural river-bank’&mdash;the
bank of the Rother&mdash;‘subsequently raised and altered by the Barons
of the Cinque Port of Romney’,<a id="FNanchor_2577" href="#Footnote_2577" class="fnanchor">2577</a> but (if I have grasped his meaning,
which is often obscure) only between Snargate and Warehorn.<a id="FNanchor_2578" href="#Footnote_2578" class="fnanchor">2578</a> He
tells us that ‘The sequence of changes in the Marsh may be summarized
as follows:&mdash;Firstly, a shallow bay existed in a depression in the
underlying rocks. Into this bay the waters of the Rother, Tillingham,
and Brede, on their way to their outlet near Romney, deposited
their silt, so that the northern half of the Marsh had become dry land
previous to the time of the Romans. Around this bay were formed
sand-hills. In time of flood the waters of the river that ran out at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
Romney overflowed, and, depositing silt, raised the banks on either
side. A slight depression of the land commenced, and has continued.
Beaches accumulated, especially between Romney and Hythe, and
between Romney and Winchelsea. Romney probably formed a
promontory near Dymchurch, near where the ancient river, then
called the Limen, discharged its waters.’<a id="FNanchor_2579" href="#Footnote_2579" class="fnanchor">2579</a> He explains that originally
the sea was excluded from the marsh by sand-hills, and that ‘the
sand-hills appear to have been formed at a period before the accumulation
of the beaches had commenced, since the beach effectually stops
the formation of sand-hills’.<a id="FNanchor_2580" href="#Footnote_2580" class="fnanchor">2580</a> No sand-hills now exist in the marsh,
except between Rye and Lydd, near New Romney, and near West
Hythe; but, says Dowker, ‘We may connect these sand-hills by
a hypothetical line extending from Rye to Hythe.’<a id="FNanchor_2581" href="#Footnote_2581" class="fnanchor">2581</a> The reason
which he gives for believing that there has been a depression of the
land since the time of the Romans is that he has found evidences of
post-Roman subsidence in ‘the neighbourhood of Richborough,
Reculvers, and the Swale marshes of Sittingbourne’.<a id="FNanchor_2582" href="#Footnote_2582" class="fnanchor">2582</a></p>

<p>Now Dowker gives no sufficient reason for refusing to accept
Elliott’s view (which he travesties) that the sea once found its way
over the marsh through a gap between the advancing shingle and
the hills, and also through a break in the shingle spit,&mdash;in other words,
for maintaining that the marsh had become dry land before the shingle
beach was formed. The notion that the Rhee Wall was, ‘in the first
place, a natural river-bank’ is simply fantastic. To begin with, its
direction is almost a straight line, whereas it is well known that in
open plains, where the slope is slight, rivers invariably pursue tortuous
courses.<a id="FNanchor_2583" href="#Footnote_2583" class="fnanchor">2583</a> Along what is now called the Rhee Wall runs the high
road from Appledore to New Romney. It occupies what was formerly
a channel embanked on either side; and this channel provided an
outlet for the waters of the Rother, whose actual mouth was at
Appledore.<a id="FNanchor_2584" href="#Footnote_2584" class="fnanchor">2584</a> As Elliott says, ‘In erecting this wall it became necessary
to provide some exit for the waters from the hills as well as for
the drainage of the land enclosed. This was done by cutting a
channel parallel with the wall from the pool or lake at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embouchure</i>
of the river Limene at Appledore to the sea at Romney ... the wall was
necessary to be continued across this lake until it met the high land
at Appledore.’<a id="FNanchor_2585" href="#Footnote_2585" class="fnanchor">2585</a> Again, I cannot understand why, if Romney Marsh
Proper became dry land before the time of the Romans without being
artificially enclosed, Walland Marsh and Guildford Marsh, which lie
west and south of the Rhee Wall, should still have been periodically
overflowed by the sea; nor is it clear how in that case the Rother
could have excavated its hypothetical channel along the line of the
Rhee Wall. Lastly, it is impossible, on Dowker’s theory, to locate
the Portus Lemanis. He denies that it was at Lympne: it could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span>
not, on his theory, have been at Hythe or at West Hythe, for he
implies that the shingle beach, behind which lay the historic Hythe
Haven, did not yet exist;<a id="FNanchor_2586" href="#Footnote_2586" class="fnanchor">2586</a> and Romney&mdash;the only other possible
site&mdash;is, as I shall afterwards show, out of the question.</p>

<p>I am not concerned to dispute Dowker’s theory that the sea was
excluded from the marsh on the south by sand-hills before the shingle
beach was formed, though the mere presence of patches of blown sand
near West Hythe and near Romney does not justify him in connecting
them by ‘a hypothetical line extending from Rye to Hythe’; nor
does he offer any theory to account for the disappearance of this
hypothetical line after it began to be protected by a barrier of
shingle. The important point is that the fact of the erection of the
Rhee Wall proves that before it existed Romney Marsh Proper was
liable to be flooded by high tides.</p>

<p>3. It has long been a vexed question where, in the time of Caesar,
and during the Roman occupation of Britain, the Rother discharged
itself. Hasted<a id="FNanchor_2587" href="#Footnote_2587" class="fnanchor">2587</a> affirms that the bed of the river ‘may yet very
easily be traced ... under the hills from <i>West Hythe</i> to Appledore’.
Beale Poste,<a id="FNanchor_2588" href="#Footnote_2588" class="fnanchor">2588</a> who agrees with him, says that, according to the
<cite>Itinerary</cite> of Antonine, the port of the river Lemanis, which he identifies
with the Rother, was the Portus Lemanis; that, according
to Somner, ancient records mention ‘the Lymne branch of the
Rother as still in existence in ... 820 at ... Warehorne, at about
... three miles from the bend of our river towards Lymne’; and
that ‘we find the name Portus Limneus in Ethelwerd’s <cite>Chronicle</cite>, iv,
3, in his annals of ... 893, which seems to imply the “Port of the river
Lemanis”.’ Holloway,<a id="FNanchor_2589" href="#Footnote_2589" class="fnanchor">2589</a> the historian of Romney Marsh, after
saying, like Hasted, that ‘traces of the ancient bed of a river are
still visible under the foot of the Kentish cliffs’, adds that ‘our
ancient chroniclers, according to Lambarde, called this same place
“Limene Mouthe”, and which is interpreted by Leland to betoken
the mouth of the river Rother’. Drew<a id="FNanchor_2590" href="#Footnote_2590" class="fnanchor">2590</a> holds that the river Limen,
or, as it is called by the anonymous geographer of Ravenna, Lemana,<a id="FNanchor_2591" href="#Footnote_2591" class="fnanchor">2591</a>
must in the ninth century have flowed past Sandtun, ‘the patch of
Blown Sand between West Hythe and Butter’s (or Botolph’s) Bridge,’
because in a charter of the year 833 allusion is made to ‘a piece of
land at Sandtun that was bounded on the south by the river Limen’.
Finally, Mr. F. P. Gulliver thinks it probable that the Rother had,
a thousand years ago, two ‘main distributaries’, one of which flowed
out ‘through an inlet in the bar south-west of Hythe’.<a id="FNanchor_2592" href="#Footnote_2592" class="fnanchor">2592</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span></p>

<p>Hasted’s statement is quite incorrect. Elliott, who knew every
inch of Romney Marsh, positively affirms that ‘between Lymne and
Appledore ... not the slightest trace of any river remains’;<a id="FNanchor_2593" href="#Footnote_2593" class="fnanchor">2593</a> and
his statement is confirmed by Topley.<a id="FNanchor_2594" href="#Footnote_2594" class="fnanchor">2594</a> Dowker<a id="FNanchor_2595" href="#Footnote_2595" class="fnanchor">2595</a> also observes that
if the Rother had ever flowed out near Hythe, ‘it must have occupied
the space where the Military Canal exists, in which case it has left
no historical or other trace behind, and against such a river the Ree
Wall could have been no protection.’ Moreover, if there is any
force in the argument of Drew, the river flowed south of the blown
sand near Butter’s Bridge, that is to say, a good mile from the hills.<a id="FNanchor_2596" href="#Footnote_2596" class="fnanchor">2596</a>
Elliott accounts for the belief that the river entered the sea near
Lympne by the fact that a depression exists along the foot of the
hills, ‘many taking that to be the river which in truth was only an
estuary ... and which would only assume something of the character
of a river at low water.’<a id="FNanchor_2597" href="#Footnote_2597" class="fnanchor">2597</a> In reply to Beale Poste, it is sufficient to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
remark that the <cite>Itinerary</cite> does <i>not</i> say that the port of the river
Lemanis (or rather Lemana) was the Portus Lemanis, nor does it
even mention the river: it simply gives the distance of the Portus
Lemanis from Durovernum, or Canterbury.<a id="FNanchor_2598" href="#Footnote_2598" class="fnanchor">2598</a> Beale Poste misquotes
Somner, who does not say a single word about ‘the Lymne branch of
the Rother’.<a id="FNanchor_2599" href="#Footnote_2599" class="fnanchor">2599</a> It is quite true that we find the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">portu Limneo</i> in
the Chronicle of Ethelwerd;<a id="FNanchor_2600" href="#Footnote_2600" class="fnanchor">2600</a> but it is not easy to see how these words
convey any more information about the geographical position of the
port than the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">portus Lemanis</i>. As to Holloway’s argument,
all that Lambarde<a id="FNanchor_2601" href="#Footnote_2601" class="fnanchor">2601</a> says is that Robert Talbot,<a id="FNanchor_2602" href="#Footnote_2602" class="fnanchor">2602</a> ‘a man of our time,’
was of opinion that Shipway, near West Hythe, was so called ‘because
it lay in the way to the Haven where the ships were woont to ride.<a id="FNanchor_2603" href="#Footnote_2603" class="fnanchor">2603</a>
And that haven,’ adds Lambarde, ‘taketh hee to be the same
which ... is called ... of Antoninus <i>Limanis</i>, of our chroniclers
Limene Mouth, and interpreted by Leland to betoken the mouth of
the river of Rother.’ The <cite>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</cite> states distinctly
that the mouth of the Limen was at Appledore;<a id="FNanchor_2604" href="#Footnote_2604" class="fnanchor">2604</a> and Leland was far
too acute to be duped by the notion that it had ever been at Lympne:
‘where the Ryver <i>Limene</i> should be,’ he says, ‘I can not tel, except
yt should be that that cummeth above Appledor ... and that ys
Cowrs ys now changed.’<a id="FNanchor_2605" href="#Footnote_2605" class="fnanchor">2605</a> With regard to Drew’s argument, allusion
is made in two charters<a id="FNanchor_2606" href="#Footnote_2606" class="fnanchor">2606</a> to ‘a piece of land at Sandtun, that was
bounded on the south by the river Limen’, namely, a charter of King
Aethilberht of Kent, dated February 20, 732, and a charter of King
Ecgberht of Kent, dated 833. In the latter it is stated that there
were salt-pans ‘in the same place’, namely at Sandtun;<a id="FNanchor_2607" href="#Footnote_2607" class="fnanchor">2607</a> and in
both the boundaries of the land are defined in almost identical
terms,&mdash;‘the boundaries of this piece of land are, on the east the
King’s land; on the south the river called the Limen; on the west
and on the north the Hudan Fleot.’<a id="FNanchor_2608" href="#Footnote_2608" class="fnanchor">2608</a> That Sandtun was the patch
of blown sand between West Hythe and Botolph’s Bridge is a
pure assumption on the part of Drew. Furthermore, he would have
found it difficult to indicate the position of ‘the King’s land’ on the
east, seeing that on the east, if the Limen debouched opposite
Lympne, there was only shingle or sea. Finally, it is certain that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
before 833 Romney Marsh Proper had been enclosed; and how a
river could have flowed along the north of the marsh across the Rhee
Wall, or how, if it had worked this miracle, it should have subsequently
disappeared without leaving any trace of its existence, is
more than I can understand.<a id="FNanchor_2609" href="#Footnote_2609" class="fnanchor">2609</a> At all events the level of the marsh,
which is 6 feet 6 inches lower at Appledore Dowles than at West
Hythe Oaks, proves that, even assuming the former existence of such
a river, centuries must have elapsed from the time when it ceased to
flow beneath the hills to the time when the shingle closed the marsh
at West Hythe Oaks.<a id="FNanchor_2610" href="#Footnote_2610" class="fnanchor">2610</a></p>

<p>Elliott<a id="FNanchor_2611" href="#Footnote_2611" class="fnanchor">2611</a> concluded, ‘from several careful surveys of the whole
district,’ that the mouth of the Limen was at Appledore, where it
entered the estuary; and, as Roach Smith<a id="FNanchor_2612" href="#Footnote_2612" class="fnanchor">2612</a> truly remarks, this
conclusion is confirmed by the <cite>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</cite>. ‘We now,’
says Elliott,<a id="FNanchor_2613" href="#Footnote_2613" class="fnanchor">2613</a> ‘find the whole country about the mouth of the Limene,
at Appledore, in a circuit of about a mile (and at no other part), at
a few feet under the present surface, covered with trees of the oak,
alder, and birch ... evidently, from their position, having been
drifted from a distance, and deposited where now found.’ Lewin<a id="FNanchor_2614" href="#Footnote_2614" class="fnanchor">2614</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>
points out that this ‘is the very lowest part of the marsh’; and he
holds that ‘the presence of oak trees ... decides that the trees are
not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2615" href="#Footnote_2615" class="fnanchor">2615</a> for ... there is something in the Marsh mould uncongenial
to the oak’. The course of the river, Elliott tells us, is ‘still
traceable between Appledore and the Isle of Oxney, and thence into
the estuary, about half a mile south of Appledore’. Once, as we
have seen, according to Elliott, the estuary found an exit opposite
Lympne: when this was closed, there remained only the channel between
Romney and Lydd.<a id="FNanchor_2616" href="#Footnote_2616" class="fnanchor">2616</a></p>

<p>4. It is now necessary to inquire what was the geographical position
of the Portus Lemanis. The reader will, of course, see that this
question is quite distinct from that which he has just been considering.
Whether the Rother ever flowed along the north of the marsh or
not, everybody admits that the sea once had access there even at
low tide; and the question is whether the Portus Lemanis was this
estuary, or rather that part of it which lay below Lympne Hill.
This is the generally accepted view.<a id="FNanchor_2617" href="#Footnote_2617" class="fnanchor">2617</a> In support of it Appach<a id="FNanchor_2618" href="#Footnote_2618" class="fnanchor">2618</a>
argues as follows:&mdash;First, the name ‘Lympne’ is obviously a corruption
of <i>Lemanis</i>, and Leland found a tradition existing that
Lympne had once been a port. Secondly, at Lympne, Stone Street,
the Roman road from Canterbury, ‘terminates abruptly,’ and ‘no
trace whatever of its continuance southward into the marsh can be
discovered’. ‘For what reason,’ asks Appach, ‘could this road have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>
been made if Lympne was not then a port?’ He goes on to observe
that, according to the <cite>Itinerary</cite> of Antonine, ‘Portus Lemanis was
one stage distant from Canterbury;’ that, besides Stone Street,
the only Roman roads which converged at Canterbury were those
which led to Reculver, Richborough, and Dover; and therefore that
the Portus Lemanis must have been situated on Stone Street, and
obviously at its termination. Thirdly, according to the <cite>Itinerary</cite>,
the distance from Canterbury to the Portus Lemanis was 16
Roman miles, or about 25,872 yards;<a id="FNanchor_2619" href="#Footnote_2619" class="fnanchor">2619</a> and the actual distance from
‘the margin of the marsh below Lympne measured along the Stone
Street to the point where all the Roman roads at Canterbury would
converge, if produced, is fifteen statute miles’, or 26,400 yards.<a id="FNanchor_2620" href="#Footnote_2620" class="fnanchor">2620</a>
Fourthly, the existence of Stutfall Castle proves that the Portus
Lemanis was at Lympne; and, moreover, the castle ‘had no southern
wall because the sea came up to the foot of the fortifications’.
Fifthly, in the <cite>Table of Peutinger</cite>, Lemanis is ‘marked with a castle,
like Richborough and Dover’.</p>

<p>These arguments may, at first sight, appear conclusive: in reality
they are worthless. (1) Leland<a id="FNanchor_2621" href="#Footnote_2621" class="fnanchor">2621</a> does not mention any tradition
about the port: he simply asserts that ‘Lymme Hill or Lyme was
sumtyme a famose Haven, and good for Shyppes that might cum
to the Foote of the Hille’. Lambarde,<a id="FNanchor_2622" href="#Footnote_2622" class="fnanchor">2622</a> it is true, says that there was
in his time a tradition that Shipway was so called because ‘it lay
in the way to the Haven where the ships were woont to ride’; and
he calls this tradition ‘the report of the countrie people, who hold
faste the same opinion which they have by tradition receaved from
their Elders’. Also he himself asserts that ‘at the first, ships were
accustomed to discharge at Lymme’. But Shipway ‘lay in the way’
to West Hythe, not to Lympne. As for the alleged tradition, everything
depends upon the date of its origin; and this cannot be ascertained.
The name ‘Lympne’ may be connected with <i>Lemanis</i>; but
this does not prove that the Portus Lemanis was at the foot of the
heights on which Lympne stands: if it had been east of Stutfall
Castle, and the nearest town in Roman times or later had been on
the site of Lympne, the origin of the name would be perfectly clear.
(2) Appach insists that Stone Street ‘terminates abruptly’ at Lympne;
but, as a matter of fact, a road diverges to the right from the straight
course of Stone Street at New Inn Green, and terminates just north
of Stutfall Castle.<a id="FNanchor_2623" href="#Footnote_2623" class="fnanchor">2623</a> Mr. Thurston of Ashford points out that if the
course of Stone Street were continued in a straight line from New Inn
Green, it ‘would point to the Shipway [or Shepway] Cross, and
continue down the present roadway which descends the hill to West
Hythe; and’, he adds, ‘this is the only place along the hill where a
roadway could possibly descend it in a straight line, and I believe it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>
was naturally selected as the road to the ships or port.’<a id="FNanchor_2624" href="#Footnote_2624" class="fnanchor">2624</a> (3) As for
the argument based upon the distance given in the <cite>Itinerary</cite> from
Canterbury to the Portus Lemanis, a moment’s reflection will convince
any reader who uses his map that it holds good for the theory that
the Portus Lemanis was at West Hythe as well as for the view which
Appach defends. (4) The situation of Stutfall Castle may no doubt
be used as an argument to prove that the Portus Lemanis was at
Lympne: but the castle is barely a mile and a half from West Hythe
Oaks, which, as we shall presently see, was in all probability the
western end of the port; and, although it was believed when Appach
wrote that the castle had no southern wall, excavation has since
proved that it had.<a id="FNanchor_2625" href="#Footnote_2625" class="fnanchor">2625</a> Appach’s last argument depends, like the one
which precedes it, upon the assumption that Stutfall Castle would
have been useless unless it had stood in <i>immediate proximity</i> to the
Portus Lemanis. What if Lemanis was ‘marked with a castle’?
Why should not the castle have protected the neighbouring part of
‘the Saxon shore’ and a harbour at West Hythe?</p>

<p>The late antiquary, W. H. Black,<a id="FNanchor_2626" href="#Footnote_2626" class="fnanchor">2626</a> remarked further, that the
discovery of a Roman altar in Stutfall Castle, erected by the ‘admiral
of the British fleet’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praefectus classis Britannicae</i>), proves that the
Portus Lemanis was at Lympne; and, observing that ‘the Saxon
Chronicle tells us of the arrival of a fleet of Danes at “Limene mouth”’,
he argues that ‘it is impossible to deny the identity of Lymne with
that name’. But, whatever may be the etymological connexion
between <i>Lympne</i> and <i>Limene</i>, it has been shown already that
according to the very chronicle which Black cites, the mouth of the
Limen was at Appledore;<a id="FNanchor_2627" href="#Footnote_2627" class="fnanchor">2627</a> and the discovery of the Roman altar is
perfectly consistent with the view that the harbour which was the
admiral’s naval base was near West Hythe.</p>

<p>Elliott originally held that the Portus Lemanis was the estuary at
Lympne;<a id="FNanchor_2628" href="#Footnote_2628" class="fnanchor">2628</a> and his opinion was quoted by superficial writers in
support of this view several years after he had himself discarded it.
For he finally came to the conclusion that, even as early as Caesar’s
time, there was no harbour at Lympne.<a id="FNanchor_2629" href="#Footnote_2629" class="fnanchor">2629</a> He tells us that ‘recent
investigations in taking a series of levels over the whole of Romney
Marsh have established the fact that the estuary must have been
closed at the eastern extremity (where the Portus Lemanis is commonly
looked for) many centuries before the sea was shut out from ... Romney
Marsh Proper; for at the extreme eastern end of Romney
Marsh, by Hythe Oaks, the surface of the land is 18 inches higher
than it is a mile westward, a state of things that could not have
existed had there been any outlet towards the east after the closing
of the Marsh westward. The inset and outset of the tides twice a
day to and from the estuary would have counteracted the silting,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span>
and produced not an elevation, but a depression of the surface.
There is ... a regular and continuous fall of the land next the hills,
from Hythe Oaks into Appledore Dowles ... the lowest part of the
Marsh being 6 feet 6 inches lower than the land at Hythe Oaks.
There could have been no silting after the inclosure of the Marsh,
and the present level is such as it was when the Marsh was reclaimed.... The
barrier which sealed up the eastern mouth of the estuary was
the accumulation of shingle from the west, and (<i>sic</i>) which long before
the historic period had reached the hills at Hythe Oaks. If Romney
Marsh, at the foot of the castrum [Stutfall Castle], was dry land at
that time [<small>A.D.</small> 368-9, when Theodosius<a id="FNanchor_2630" href="#Footnote_2630" class="fnanchor">2630</a> was in Britain] and occupied
by the Romans (as we know to have been the case), Stutfall could
not have been the “Portus Lemanis” ... as it was not accessible
from the sea, and lay a mile and a half at least from it. The sea
could not have flowed there without putting the whole of Romney
Marsh Proper under water to the depth of eight or ten feet every
springtide.’ Similarly, Lewin<a id="FNanchor_2631" href="#Footnote_2631" class="fnanchor">2631</a> states, on the authority of Elliott,
that ‘the greater elevation of the soil towards the east of Romney
Marsh Proper can be only accounted for by the fact that when the
shingle “full” had been thrown quite across the Marsh at West
Oaks ... the sea still entered from the west, and that, thenceforth,
the process of silting went on for many centuries ... most rapidly
towards the east, where the water was tranquil, and less rapidly
towards the [site of the subsequently erected] Rhee Wall, in which
direction was the scour of the current’.</p>

<p>‘Many centuries’ is a vague expression; but for ‘many’ substitute
‘three’, and, even for the time of Caesar, the argument still
holds good,&mdash;unless Elliott’s theory of the formation of the marsh
is to be rejected.</p>

<p>But there are writers whom Elliott’s reasoning (if indeed they have
considered it) leaves unconvinced. According to Mr. George E. Fox,
it has been proved by excavation that the existing <i>castellum</i> at
Stutfall is not earlier than the time of Constantine;<a id="FNanchor_2632" href="#Footnote_2632" class="fnanchor">2632</a> but Sir Victor
Horsley, while confirming this statement, tells us that he has himself
found ‘in the foundation of the chief gate an altar ... marked with
barnacles, having been clearly at one time under the sea’; and
from this he infers that an earlier fort was ‘overwhelmed by an
incursion of the sea over Romney level’. Sir Victor also tells us
that he has found ‘in the concrete boulder formation of the south
wall ... a coin of Maximinus, who flourished 237 <small>A.D.</small>’, and ‘at the
foot of the wall on the inner side, a Gaulish coin of Tetricus the elder,
of a date about 260, and finally in the black soil of the camp, i.e. in the
most recent and superficial layers, numerous coins of the Constantine
family’.<a id="FNanchor_2633" href="#Footnote_2633" class="fnanchor">2633</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span></p>

<p>I do not know whether Sir Victor Horsley concludes from these
discoveries that there was a harbour at Lympne when the earlier
hypothetical <i>castellum</i> at Stutfall was destroyed; but at all events
that is the opinion of Mr. Fox. But the ‘incursion of the sea’ which
Sir Victor Horsley believes to have overwhelmed the original fort,
if it was not caused by an abnormally high tide rushing in between
Romney and Lydd before the erection of the Rhee Wall, may have
been due to a similar tide which burst the bar of shingle between
Dymchurch and West Hythe. Even after the marsh had been
artificially enclosed, such floods occurred. Stukeley<a id="FNanchor_2634" href="#Footnote_2634" class="fnanchor">2634</a> tells us that
‘George Hunt, an old man, living in the farm-house ... says, once
the sea-bank broke, and his house with all the adjacent marshes
was floated’,<a id="FNanchor_2635" href="#Footnote_2635" class="fnanchor">2635</a> &amp;c.</p>

<p>Lewin maintained that the Portus Lemanis was neither at Lympne
nor at West Hythe, but at Hythe. This, it should be noted, was the
conclusion at which he finally arrived:<a id="FNanchor_2636" href="#Footnote_2636" class="fnanchor">2636</a> when he wrote his book on
the invasion of Julius Caesar, he held that in 55 <small>B.C.</small> there was a port
at Lympne, although in the Appendix to that book he discarded this
view, and argued that the only port was a pool harbour extending
behind a shingle spit from West Hythe Oaks to a point opposite
Shorncliffe. His final view, as we have already seen,<a id="FNanchor_2637" href="#Footnote_2637" class="fnanchor">2637</a> was that this
harbour extended no further westward than Hythe itself: but in
giving utterance to this opinion he did not explain why he had abandoned
the one which preceded it, and indeed made no allusion to it
at all.</p>

<p>He states that ‘in the course of ages’, after the shingle had reached
West Hythe Oaks, it ‘was again wrested aside and dashed against
the hills at Hythe, between the present barracks and the more eastern
of the two Hythe bridges over the canal’. He goes on to say that
‘the part between Hythe Oaks and Hythe (now Duck Marsh) was
thus barred from the sea, and became a lake into which flowed the
rivulet called Slabrook and other springs, and these waters accumulating
forced their way back at Hythe Oaks, and there opened a way
for themselves ... into the estuary in the west; but, as the flood was
not considerable, the outlet was of no great breadth. The shingle spit ... was
again carried along eastward until it reached Shorncliffe.... Between
Hythe and Shorncliffe, however, was left behind (i.e. north
of) the spit, a triangular space, into which flowed two streams ... one
from Saltwood and the other called Seabrook, and the waters
within this spit were gradually swollen, until they forced a passage
through the shingle, at a point near the end of the elm avenue at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
Hythe.’ The change which his opinion underwent will be at once
apparent to any one who compares the map which Elliott constructed
for <cite>The Invasion of Britain by Julius Caesar</cite> (facing page liii) with that
which accompanies the article in the fortieth volume of <cite>Archaeologia</cite><a id="FNanchor_2638" href="#Footnote_2638" class="fnanchor">2638</a>
(facing page 369). Lewin argues that it was so easy to exclude the
sea from Duck Marsh that ‘probably the inclosure was made by the
Britons before the arrival of the Romans. On the south-east,’ he
explains, ‘the shingle bank was continuous up to the hills ... on the
west the sea entered only from the marsh at the foot of the hills by
a narrow channel; and all that was required was a short dam at
this point between the shingle bed and the hills.’ The remains of
this dam, Lewin observes, are ‘still distinguishable ... at Hythe
Oaks, but the part next the hills has been swept away by the military
canal. This partial inclosure, prior to the inclosure of Romney Marsh,
accounts for a fact otherwise inexplicable, viz. that Duck Marsh is
not within the jurisdiction of Romney Marsh.’<a id="FNanchor_2639" href="#Footnote_2639" class="fnanchor">2639</a></p>

<p>Perhaps. But the date of the construction of the dam is not
known. May it not have been made after, or simultaneously with, the
erection of the Rhee Wall, to secure Romney Marsh against all possibility
of inundation, not to protect Duck Marsh, which, according to
Lewin’s earlier view, was originally overflowed by Hythe harbour?
In other words, is it not possible that when the dam was made Hythe
harbour extended westward as far as West Hythe Oaks? This, as I
have already said, was not merely Lewin’s original view: it was also
the view which Elliott, his friend and adviser, retained <i>after</i> the
publication of the article in <cite>Archaeologia</cite>. At all events this view
finds expression in a map which Elliott prepared for Furley’s <cite>History
of the Weald of Kent</cite>, which was not published until 1871, five years
after the appearance of Lewin’s article. That being the case, and
considering that Lewin did not explain the reasons which led him
to change his opinion, I am unable to follow him.</p>

<p>In support of the theory that the Portus Lemanis was at Hythe
Lewin argues, first, that Stone Street terminated at West Hythe;
secondly, that the port could not have been at West Hythe; otherwise
‘<i>the whole of West Hythe ... would have been deluged</i>’. ‘The very
name,’ he adds, ‘shows that Hythe was the principal town, and West
Hythe an accretion to it.’ Thirdly, he affirms that Roman remains
have been found at Hythe; and, fourthly, that a branch from Stone
Street led to Hythe. He also bases an argument upon the itinerary
of Richard of Cirencester, which, as every scholar now knows, is a
forgery.<a id="FNanchor_2640" href="#Footnote_2640" class="fnanchor">2640</a></p>

<p>Stone Street does terminate, as Lewin says, at West Hythe; but
the fact goes to prove that it gave access to a harbour which was at
West Hythe.<a id="FNanchor_2641" href="#Footnote_2641" class="fnanchor">2641</a> Granting that West Hythe would have been ‘deluged’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
if the port had been there, what then? Why should it not have been?
Lewin does not explain what he means by ‘the whole of West Hythe’;
and, in default of this explanation, it is impossible to understand his
argument.<a id="FNanchor_2642" href="#Footnote_2642" class="fnanchor">2642</a> He himself, as we have seen, in his book on the invasion
of Britain by Julius Caesar makes the port extend westward as far
as West Hythe Oaks; and Black shows that, so far from its being
true that West Hythe is merely an ‘accretion’ of Hythe, Hythe is
merely East Hythe, and that it is so called in Ogilby’s <cite>Britannia</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_2643" href="#Footnote_2643" class="fnanchor">2643</a>
The discovery of Roman remains at Hythe does not prove that Hythe
was the Portus Lemanis any more than the discovery of Roman
remains at Dymchurch proves that the Portus Lemanis was there.
Or rather, the discovery does not prove that the Portus Lemanis
extended no further westward than Hythe; for I freely admit that it
extended in front of and to the east of it. It is not proved that a
branch from Stone Street led to Hythe;<a id="FNanchor_2644" href="#Footnote_2644" class="fnanchor">2644</a> and if there was such
a branch, the fact does not prove that the harbour did not extend as
far as West Hythe Oaks. Finally, Black points out that, whereas the
distance of Lympne (and, he might have added, of West Hythe) from
Canterbury corresponds with that of the Portus Lemanis from
Durovernum, as given in the <cite>Itinerary</cite> of Antonine, the distance of
Hythe by road from the same place is two miles further.<a id="FNanchor_2645" href="#Footnote_2645" class="fnanchor">2645</a></p>

<p>5. The first step taken for the enclosure of Romney Marsh was the
erection of the Rhee Wall. By whom and at what date this work was
executed is not certainly known. It is generally attributed to the
Romans; but Lewin<a id="FNanchor_2646" href="#Footnote_2646" class="fnanchor">2646</a> assures us that Mr. Smiles, in his <cite>Lives of the
Engineers</cite>, ‘expresses an opinion that the Marsh was reclaimed by
the Belgae.’ What Mr. Smiles<a id="FNanchor_2647" href="#Footnote_2647" class="fnanchor">2647</a> really says is that ‘the reclamation of
this tract is supposed to be due to the Frisians’; and he does not tell
us by whom the supposition is entertained, or on what grounds it is
based. Lewin himself, asking whether [Appledore] ‘Dowles’ is not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span>
derived from the Celtic word <i>dol</i>, says that ‘if a part of Romney
Marsh was named by the Ancient Britons, the marsh itself must have
been reclaimed by them’.<a id="FNanchor_2648" href="#Footnote_2648" class="fnanchor">2648</a> From the same word Appach<a id="FNanchor_2649" href="#Footnote_2649" class="fnanchor">2649</a> draws
precisely the opposite inference. ‘Apuldore Dowles,’ he says,
‘appears to be allied to the Welsh <i>dol</i>, a bend. If so, it would mean
a bend or curve, and so a recess or bay; and Apuldore Dowles would
mean the bay of Apuldore.’ Whatever may be the value of this
argument, the name ‘Apuldore Dowles,’ does not go to prove that
Romney Marsh was ‘inned’ by the Britons; for, as Appach<a id="FNanchor_2650" href="#Footnote_2650" class="fnanchor">2650</a> truly
remarks, there is no other local name in Romney Marsh Proper which
shows any trace of a Celtic derivation.</p>

<p>Mr. W. A. S. Robertson,<a id="FNanchor_2651" href="#Footnote_2651" class="fnanchor">2651</a> on the other hand, states, on the authority
of Professor Skeat, that ‘Rumenea’, the name by which, according
to Lambarde,<a id="FNanchor_2652" href="#Footnote_2652" class="fnanchor">2652</a> Romney was known to the Saxons, is compounded of
the Gaelic word <i>ruimen</i> (marsh) and the Saxon affix <i>ea</i> (river); and
he concludes that ‘before the Roman occupation there was in this
great estuary sufficient land, uncovered by water, to be denominated ... <i>Rum</i>
or <i>Ruimen</i>’. Again, arguing that the καινὸς λιμήν, or ‘new
harbour’, mentioned by Ptolemy,<a id="FNanchor_2653" href="#Footnote_2653" class="fnanchor">2653</a> was at Romney, he says that
‘if it was called into existence by ... the Rhee Wall, it follows that
the Rhee Wall’ was ‘probably formed at least as early as the first
century of the Christian era’.</p>

<p>If the ‘new harbour’ was at Romney! There is not the slightest
evidence that it was there.<a id="FNanchor_2654" href="#Footnote_2654" class="fnanchor">2654</a> As for the word <i>ruimen</i>, how can
Mr. Robertson prove that it was applied to Romney Marsh ‘before the
Roman occupation’? Moreover, supposing that the marsh was not
embanked by the Britons, there was ‘sufficient land uncovered by
water to be denominated <i>Ruimen</i>’ twice every day, when the tide
was low, before the Rhee Wall was made; and the name lends no
support to Mr. Robertson’s theory.</p>

<p>I do not attach much importance to the argument, first propounded
by Sir W. Dugdale<a id="FNanchor_2655" href="#Footnote_2655" class="fnanchor">2655</a> and often repeated since, that because the
Britons, according to Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_2656" href="#Footnote_2656" class="fnanchor">2656</a>&mdash;or rather, according to a speech put
by Tacitus into the mouth of a British chief&mdash;were employed by the
Romans in draining and embanking marshes, therefore the Romans
enclosed this particular marsh. But, considering that Roman
remains have frequently been discovered in that part of the marsh
which lies on the east of the Rhee Wall,<a id="FNanchor_2657" href="#Footnote_2657" class="fnanchor">2657</a> it is surely inexplicable that
if the wall was built by the Britons, no Celtic remains have ever been
found there.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span></p>

<p>Appach<a id="FNanchor_2658" href="#Footnote_2658" class="fnanchor">2658</a> not only rejects the theory that the Britons built the
Rhee Wall, but denies that Romney Marsh Proper was enclosed
during the Roman occupation. He maintains that, in Caesar’s
time, ‘the northern portion, at all events, and possibly the whole of
the interval between the island of Romney and the high ground of
Kent was open sea.’ For, he argues, ‘Lympne was the ancient
Portus Lemanis ... that place could not have been a port unless there
had been free access to it from the Channel, and it is clear from the
manner in which the marsh and shingle were deposited, that there
was always open sea between Lympne and the Channel until the
interval between the ancient island at Romney and the high ground
of Kent had been closed by the gradual growth of the marsh and
shingle.’</p>

<p>The assumption upon which this argument rests has been already
disproved: the Portus Lemanis was not at Lympne. Appach’s
theory forces him to assume that the sediment which formed the
marsh was deposited at an incredibly rapid rate. He maintains<a id="FNanchor_2659" href="#Footnote_2659" class="fnanchor">2659</a>
that ‘the upper portion of Romney Marsh, for a depth of thirty
feet ... below its present surface (which would give sufficient water
for the heaviest of Caesar’s ships at the lowest Spring tides) might
very well have been deposited’ in ‘about five hundred years’.
But, according to Elliott,<a id="FNanchor_2660" href="#Footnote_2660" class="fnanchor">2660</a> the average rate at which the silt was
deposited was not more than about one-eighth of an inch <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per annum</i>.</p>

<p>Dowker, on the other hand, although he once regarded it as ‘evident
that at the period of Caesar’s invasion the marsh was little
better than a swamp, great part being under water at high tide’,
maintained that the discovery of Roman pottery on the west of
Dymchurch disproved Appach’s theory.<a id="FNanchor_2661" href="#Footnote_2661" class="fnanchor">2661</a> But he did not take
account of dates. Appach himself<a id="FNanchor_2662" href="#Footnote_2662" class="fnanchor">2662</a> noted the discoveries which had
been made near Dymchurch; but he observed that while some of
the objects discovered had been pronounced by the Society of
Antiquaries to be ‘decidedly Roman’, others had been attributed
by the same body to subsequent periods; and he concluded that
the marsh had not been enclosed before the middle of the fifth
century.</p>

<p>This theory is pulverized by one fact which Appach ignores.
Dymchurch is not the only place in Romney Marsh Proper where
Roman remains have been found: they have been discovered in
Eastbridge, at Newchurch, at Ivychurch, and indeed over the whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>
area.<a id="FNanchor_2663" href="#Footnote_2663" class="fnanchor">2663</a> On the other hand, Welland Marsh, Guildford Marsh, and
Denge Marsh&mdash;those parts of Romney Marsh, popularly so called,
which extend westward of the Rhee Wall&mdash;have yielded none.<a id="FNanchor_2664" href="#Footnote_2664" class="fnanchor">2664</a> The
inference is certain: Romney Marsh Proper was enclosed during the
Roman occupation of Britain.</p>

<p>6. The conclusions which we have now reached are, first, that the
Rother did not, in the time of Caesar, enter the sea at Lympne, but
debouched into the estuary near Appledore; secondly, that the
marsh was then closed at West Hythe Oaks, and therefore that there
was no harbour at Lympne; thirdly, that the Rhee Wall had not
then been built, and therefore that the marsh was still flooded at
spring tides by the inrush of the sea between Romney and Lydd;
fourthly, that the Portus Lemanis was a pool harbour extending from
West Hythe to a point nearly opposite Shorncliffe; and, lastly, that
the Rhee Wall was built in Roman times.</p>

<p>But, as the reader will hereafter see, if these conclusions are
erroneous, the error will not lead us astray when we have to determine
the place where Caesar landed in Britain.</p>

<h2 id="PII_Pg552a">PORTUS ITIUS</h2>

<h3 id="PII_Pg552b">I. REVIEW OF THE CONTROVERSY</h3>

<p>The greater part of the vast literature which has accumulated on
the question of the identity of the Portus Itius is obsolete;<a id="FNanchor_2665" href="#Footnote_2665" class="fnanchor">2665</a> and it
is now sometimes taken for granted that the choice is restricted to
Wissant and Boulogne. Nevertheless, as I am determined to set
the question at rest, I shall examine the claims of three other ports,
which, in recent times, have found advocates whose names command
respect,&mdash;the estuary of the Somme, Ambleteuse, and Calais.</p>

<p>The question began to be seriously discussed in the fifteenth
century. The Italian geographer, Raymond de Marliano, identified
the Portus Itius with Calais;<a id="FNanchor_2666" href="#Footnote_2666" class="fnanchor">2666</a> and in the following century the
famous Ortelius<a id="FNanchor_2667" href="#Footnote_2667" class="fnanchor">2667</a> did the same. Chifflet<a id="FNanchor_2668" href="#Footnote_2668" class="fnanchor">2668</a> and other scholars, well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span>
known in their day, chose St. Omer, situated, as they believed, at
the head of a wide and shallow gulf, which was erroneously assumed
to have covered the low-lying lands between Sangatte and Dunkirk.<a id="FNanchor_2669" href="#Footnote_2669" class="fnanchor">2669</a>
Adrien de Valois<a id="FNanchor_2670" href="#Footnote_2670" class="fnanchor">2670</a> declared for Étaples; and numerous other absurd
suggestions were defended with more or less ingenuity. From Dieppe
to Ghent there was not a harbour, a roadstead, or a fishing port,
which had not its champion. But the controversy soon began to
centre itself between Wissant and Boulogne. Camden<a id="FNanchor_2671" href="#Footnote_2671" class="fnanchor">2671</a> was the
first to declare for Wissant. Du Fresne<a id="FNanchor_2672" href="#Footnote_2672" class="fnanchor">2672</a> (commonly called Du
Cange), one of the most illustrious French scholars of the seventeenth
century, defended its claims against Sanson; and d’Anville,<a id="FNanchor_2673" href="#Footnote_2673" class="fnanchor">2673</a>
Henry,<a id="FNanchor_2674" href="#Footnote_2674" class="fnanchor">2674</a> Walckenaer,<a id="FNanchor_2675" href="#Footnote_2675" class="fnanchor">2675</a> and Sir Richard Colt Hoare<a id="FNanchor_2676" href="#Footnote_2676" class="fnanchor">2676</a> followed his
example. Cluver<a id="FNanchor_2677" href="#Footnote_2677" class="fnanchor">2677</a> wrote briefly but effectively on the other side;
and Scaliger<a id="FNanchor_2678" href="#Footnote_2678" class="fnanchor">2678</a> characteristically exclaimed that those who did not,
like himself, decide for Boulogne, were lunatics. During the last
half-century, although Wissant has not lacked able defenders, the
case for Boulogne has been tending to prevail. But the arguments
of Haigneré, of Napoleon the Third, of Desjardins, and finally
of Rudolf Schneider failed to silence opposition. Men so able as
George Long, Dr. Guest, Dean Merivale, Dr. Hodgkin, Karl Müller,
and Alphonse Wauters remained unconvinced: Freeman<a id="FNanchor_2679" href="#Footnote_2679" class="fnanchor">2679</a> roundly
asserted that ‘since Dr. Guest’s exposition of the matter it is hardly
necessary to say that “Portus Itius” or “Iccius” is not Boulogne’:
Professor Ridgeway and Mr. H. E. Malden, in their animated controversy<a id="FNanchor_2680" href="#Footnote_2680" class="fnanchor">2680</a>
on the question of Caesar’s landing-place, agreed in
identifying the harbour from which he sailed with Wissant: more
recently Dr. Emil Hübner<a id="FNanchor_2681" href="#Footnote_2681" class="fnanchor">2681</a> has done the same; and the well-known
Caesarian scholar, Professor H. J. Heller, at the close of a pungent
criticism<a id="FNanchor_2682" href="#Footnote_2682" class="fnanchor">2682</a> of Schneider’s dissertation, concluded that the identity
of the Portus Itius was still an open question. Mr. H. F. Tozer,<a id="FNanchor_2683" href="#Footnote_2683" class="fnanchor">2683</a>
indeed, has recently pronounced the question to be insoluble; and
Mommsen,<a id="FNanchor_2684" href="#Footnote_2684" class="fnanchor">2684</a> who in 1889 still adhered to his old belief, that ‘among
the many possibilities most may perhaps be said in favour of the
view that the Itian port ... is to be sought near Ambleteuse’, nevertheless
remained convinced that ‘it requires the implicit faith of local
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span>
topographers to proceed to the determination of the locality with
such data’.</p>

<p>Evidently, then, unless the problem is to be abandoned in despair,
there is room for another treatise. But this treatise must justify
its existence. I have not ‘the implicit faith of local topographers’:
but there are more data than Mommsen had leisure to examine;
and the locality can be determined with absolute certainty.</p>

<p>There is indeed a summary way of dealing with the question which
has long since satisfied practical men: doubt is confined to the minds
of scholars and of those who look to them for guidance. Men
who are familiar with war and who have a sufficient knowledge of
the conditions of navigation in the Straits of Dover know that
there was only one port on the north-eastern coast of Gaul which
would have answered all Caesar’s requirements, and that Caesar
would not have made a foolish choice. Accordingly the greatest
of modern soldiers affirmed without hesitation that the greatest
soldier of Rome had sailed to Britain from Boulogne. But this
reasoning, perhaps because of its simplicity, has not seemed conclusive
to the learned world.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg554">II. THE DATA FURNISHED BY CAESAR, STRABO,
AND PTOLEMY</h3>

<p>Caesar says that, before his first expedition to Britain, he sent
Gaius Volusenus to reconnoitre the British coast and ascertain what
harbours were capable of accommodating a large fleet, and that
he himself marched with his whole force for the country of the
Morini, ‘because the shortest passage to Britain was from their
country’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod inde erat brevissimus in Britanniam traiectus</i>); and
he goes on to say that he ordered ships from the neighbouring
districts, and likewise the fleet which he had built in the previous
summer for the war with the Veneti, to assemble there. He set sail
soon after midnight with about 80 transports, some ships of war,
and some small fast-sailing vessels (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">speculatoria navigia</i>) from a
port which he does not name, and sent his cavalry to ‘a further
port’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in ulteriorem portum</i>) about 8 Roman miles off, with orders
to embark there in eighteen transports, which had been prevented
by contrary winds from reaching the port whence he himself sailed,
and to follow him. In another chapter he speaks of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior
portus</i> as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">superior portus</i>; and it is admitted that this port was
either north or east of the one from which he himself sailed. On the
fourth day after he landed in Britain (the day of landing being
doubtless reckoned as the first day<a id="FNanchor_2685" href="#Footnote_2685" class="fnanchor">2685</a>) the eighteen transports set sail.
They were getting close to Britain and were descried from the
Roman camp when a storm suddenly arose, and none of them could
keep on its course, but some were carried back to the place from
which they had started, that is to say, to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">superior portus</i>; while
the rest were driven down ‘in great peril to the lower and more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>
westerly part of the island’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad inferiorem partem insulae, quae est
propius solis occasum magno suo cum periculo deicerentur</i>), whence,
after anchoring for a time and shipping a quantity of water, they
were compelled to stand out to sea, and ran for the Continent. When
Caesar returned to Gaul, two of his ships were unable to reach
‘the same ports’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eosdem portus</i>) as the rest of the fleet, and were
carried ‘a little further down’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paulo infra</i>). Before his second
expedition he assembled a fleet of about 540 transports and 28 ships
of war at the Portus Itius, ‘from which port he had ascertained that
the passage to Britain was most convenient,<a id="FNanchor_2686" href="#Footnote_2686" class="fnanchor">2686</a> being about 30 [Roman]
miles from the Continent’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quo ex portu commodissimum in Britanniam
traiectum esse cognoverat, circiter milium passuum</i> XXX <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">transmissum
a continenti</i>). His entire flotilla amounted to more than
800 sail, as it included privately owned vessels. The transports were
of small draught and comparatively broad, and were constructed
for rowing as well as sailing. Caesar was delayed at the Portus Itius
for about 25 days by north-westerly winds.<a id="FNanchor_2687" href="#Footnote_2687" class="fnanchor">2687</a> His entire army,
which was with him all that time, amounted to 8 legions and 4000
cavalry. He set sail about sunset, accompanied by 5 legions and
2000 cavalry, with a light south-westerly wind, or, to speak more
accurately, the wind called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Africus</i>, which may have blown from
any quarter between south-west and W. by S. ⅓ S. Labienus was
left behind with 3 legions and 2000 cavalry ‘to protect the ports’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut portus tueretur</i>), which implies that on the second expedition, as
on the first, Caesar thought it necessary to keep more than one port
under his control; and during his absence Labienus built 60 ships.<a id="FNanchor_2688" href="#Footnote_2688" class="fnanchor">2688</a></p>

<p>Strabo,<a id="FNanchor_2689" href="#Footnote_2689" class="fnanchor">2689</a> evidently referring to Caesar’s first expedition, says that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span>
he sailed from ‘the Itian’ [naval station?] (τὸ Ἴτιον), and that the
length of his voyage to the point which he reached ‘about the fourth
hour’ was 320 stades, which is equivalent to 40 Roman miles.</p>

<p>Ptolemy<a id="FNanchor_2690" href="#Footnote_2690" class="fnanchor">2690</a> mentions the Itian promontory. Its longitude, he says,
was 22° 15′, and its latitude 53° 30′; and he places it on the west of
Gesoriacum, or Boulogne. The longitude of Gesoriacum, he says,
was 22° 30′, and its latitude 53° 30′.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg556">III. CAESAR SAILED FROM THE PORTUS ITIUS ON
BOTH HIS EXPEDITIONS</h3>

<p>It is necessary to inquire whether Caesar sailed from the same
port on both his expeditions; for he mentions the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i>
only in connexion with the first; and if on that occasion he sailed
from the Portus Itius, the search for the Portus Itius is conditioned
by the existence of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i>. Drumann,<a id="FNanchor_2691" href="#Footnote_2691" class="fnanchor">2691</a> remarking that
Caesar chose the Portus Itius in 54 <small>B.C.</small> because he had ascertained
that the passage from it to the island was <i>the most convenient</i>, argues
that ‘before it was consequently unknown to him’, and that ‘at
first he sought <i>the shortest passage</i>’. Long,<a id="FNanchor_2692" href="#Footnote_2692" class="fnanchor">2692</a> on the other hand,
insists that when Caesar says that he had ascertained that the
passage from the Portus Itius was the most convenient, he apparently
means ‘that he had by his first voyage found out that this
was the best place to sail from’. ‘His first voyage,’ Long continues,
‘was very lucky, and there was no reason to change his place of
embarkation, particularly as he intended to land, and did land,
at the place where he had landed before. Besides this, when he
speaks (v. 8) of his landing-place on the second voyage, he says,
“qua optimum esse egressum superiore aestate cognoverat”; the
same form of expression that he uses in speaking of the place of
embarkation (v. 2), except that he does not there use the words
“superiore aestate”.’ I may observe that it is not quite true that
Caesar in 54 <small>B.C.</small> ‘intended to land, and did land, at the place
where he had landed before’.<a id="FNanchor_2693" href="#Footnote_2693" class="fnanchor">2693</a> On the other hand, Mr. H. E. Malden
has remarked (though he has since abandoned the conclusion to
which his remarks led him) that Caesar ‘names the second [port]
and does not name the first ... he especially mentions that he
disembarked on both occasions at the same place, he gives himself
every opportunity for saying that he sailed from the same port,
if he did so, but yet he never says it’.<a id="FNanchor_2694" href="#Footnote_2694" class="fnanchor">2694</a> Strabo admittedly implies
that in the first expedition Caesar’s point of departure was the
Portus Itius: but his testimony does not settle the question;
for he may only have been putting his own construction on Caesar’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span>
words. Rudolf Schneider<a id="FNanchor_2695" href="#Footnote_2695" class="fnanchor">2695</a> concludes that it is impossible to <i>prove</i>
that the Portus Itius was the starting-point of both voyages, but
that it most probably was, because Caesar, before his first expedition,
had stayed long enough in the country of the Morini to find out
the most convenient harbour. I go further, and shall prove, in
the course of this discussion, that, on his first as on his second
expedition, Caesar sailed from the Portus Itius.<a id="FNanchor_2696" href="#Footnote_2696" class="fnanchor">2696</a></p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg557">IV. THE VALUE OF CAESAR’S ESTIMATE OF THE
DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PORTUS ITIUS AND BRITAIN</h3>

<p>Rudolf Schneider<a id="FNanchor_2697" href="#Footnote_2697" class="fnanchor">2697</a> insists that it is idle to lay stress on Caesar’s
estimate of the distance from the Portus Itius to Britain, first,
because he had no means of making an accurate calculation, and,
secondly, because we cannot tell whether he reckoned the distance
to the nearest point of Britain or to his own landing-place. As
regards correspondence with Caesar’s estimate, Schneider continues,
there is nothing to choose between Boulogne, Wissant, and
Calais: Dover is 34 Roman miles from Boulogne, 25 from Wissant,
28 from Calais. It might perhaps be argued that, if Caesar took
his own landing-place as the terminus, it would be hardly safe to
ignore his estimate. For Wissant is 27 Roman miles from Deal,
and Boulogne 39; and, assuming that Caesar landed near Hythe,
Wissant is 32 Roman miles from that port, and Boulogne 37. It
appears, however, to me almost certain that Caesar’s estimate
referred to the distance from the Portus Itius to the nearest frequented
port of Britain;<a id="FNanchor_2698" href="#Footnote_2698" class="fnanchor">2698</a> and it must not be forgotten that the ancient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span>
writers generally overestimated the distance from one port to
another.<a id="FNanchor_2699" href="#Footnote_2699" class="fnanchor">2699</a> Moreover, it is not absolutely certain that Caesar estimated
the distance of the Portus Itius from Britain at 30 Roman miles.
<i>XXX</i> is indeed found in all the extant <i>MSS.</i>;<a id="FNanchor_2700" href="#Footnote_2700" class="fnanchor">2700</a> but as Strabo unquestionably
used the <cite>Commentaries</cite> when he wrote his notice of Caesar’s
voyage, and estimated its length as 320 stades, it is not improbable
that he found in his copy the number <i>XXXX</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2701" href="#Footnote_2701" class="fnanchor">2701</a> Schneider, however,
points out that Strabo’s estimate of the length of the south coast
of Britain differs from Caesar’s; and the accuracy of the <i>MSS.</i>,
as regards the number <i>XXX</i>, may perhaps, as he says, be supported
by a comparison of Pliny with Caesar. Pliny<a id="FNanchor_2702" href="#Footnote_2702" class="fnanchor">2702</a> says that the shortest
passage between Ireland and Britain is 30 miles, and Caesar<a id="FNanchor_2703" href="#Footnote_2703" class="fnanchor">2703</a> says
that the passage from Ireland to Britain is equal in length to the
passage from Britain to Gaul. On the whole, we may conclude that
Caesar’s estimate of the distance between the Portus Itius and
Britain does not help us to decide whether the Portus Itius is to be
identified with Wissant or with Boulogne. But, in considering the
arguments for the identity of the Portus Itius with the mouth of the
Somme, Caesar’s estimate must obviously be taken into account.<a id="FNanchor_2704" href="#Footnote_2704" class="fnanchor">2704</a></p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg558">V. THE ESTUARY OF THE SOMME</h3>

<p>The advocate of the Somme was the late Astronomer-Royal,
Sir George Airy. His arguments shall be considered for the benefit
of those who are influenced by his great reputation; but one fact,
which he ignores, is alone sufficient to wreck his theory. If Caesar
sailed from the mouth of the Somme, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">superior portus</i>, from
which his cavalry transports sailed was, as Airy of course maintains,
the mouth of the Authie, and the place where he landed in Britain
was, as Airy likewise maintains, Pevensey. Therefore, on Airy’s
theory, the cavalry transports, when they were approaching Britain
and were seen in the offing from Caesar’s camp, were approaching
Pevensey; and the gale which prevented them from reaching their
destination and drove some of them ‘in great peril’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magno cum
periculo</i>) westward down the coast, carried the others back to the
mouth of the Authie.<a id="FNanchor_2705" href="#Footnote_2705" class="fnanchor">2705</a> But, as the harbour-master of Dover remarked
to me, and as any one may see for himself who has the most rudimentary
knowledge of seamanship, it would have been utterly impossible
for them to fetch the mouth of that river.</p>

<p>But to timid reasoners this may appear too summary a method
of disposing of Airy’s theory. Let us then hear what he has to say.</p>

<p>First, Airy maintains that Caesar, when he says that he ‘set out
for the country of the Morini’ (<i>in Morinos proficiscitur</i>), merely implies
that he arrived ‘near it or close to it’, not necessarily that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">559</span>
he actually entered it. He insists that in every instance in which
Caesar ‘uses the inflexions or derivatives of “proficiscor”’ ‘another
sentence or another clause is required to denote arrival at the
journey’s end’.<a id="FNanchor_2706" href="#Footnote_2706" class="fnanchor">2706</a></p>

<p>Now Caesar uses <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proficisci</i> with <i>in</i> thirty-five times. If the reader
will turn to the lists of those passages in Meusel’s <i>Lexicon Caesarianum</i>
(ii, 96, 1240), he will find that in almost every instance in which
Caesar says that he himself or any one else ‘started for’ or was about
to ‘start for’ this or that place, the context proves that the place
was reached. Of course the proof is generally furnished by ‘another
sentence or another clause’, or by more than one other sentence.
But this is not always the case.<a id="FNanchor_2707" href="#Footnote_2707" class="fnanchor">2707</a> And for the passage in question
similar proof is forthcoming. Immediately after telling us that he
marched for the country of the Morini, Caesar goes on to say that
he ordered his fleet to assemble there.<a id="FNanchor_2708" href="#Footnote_2708" class="fnanchor">2708</a> As Long sensibly remarks,<a id="FNanchor_2709" href="#Footnote_2709" class="fnanchor">2709</a>
‘when a man says that he “marches for” or “towards the country
of the Morini because the passage from there to Britain was the
shortest”; that he ordered all his ships to come there; and that
while he was waiting “in these parts” (<i>in his locis</i><a id="FNanchor_2710" href="#Footnote_2710" class="fnanchor">2710</a>) to get his ships
ready, ambassadors from a large part of the Morini came to him,
there is only one conclusion, which is, that he was in the country of
the Morini and sailed from it.’ If Caesar had removed his ships
from the country where he had assembled them and had sailed from
some other place, he would surely have said something to warn his
readers against drawing the conclusion which, to every one except
Airy, has always appeared inevitable.</p>

<p>Secondly, Airy points to the passage<a id="FNanchor_2711" href="#Footnote_2711" class="fnanchor">2711</a> in which Caesar relates that
while he was collecting ships for the first expedition envoys came
to him from the Morini: ‘the visit of the ambassadors,’ he argues,
‘without any mention of hostile occupation, seems to imply that
neither Caesar nor any part of his army was in the country of the
Morini at the time of preparing the naval expedition, and appears
to render it most improbable that he had passed through their
country.’<a id="FNanchor_2712" href="#Footnote_2712" class="fnanchor">2712</a></p>

<p>No unbiassed reader would assent to this conclusion. The
Morini naturally sent ambassadors to Caesar because they wished to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span>
deprecate his wrath. Similarly in 53 <small>B.C.</small> the Ubii sent envoys to
him when he was in their country, not as an enemy but as a friend.<a id="FNanchor_2713" href="#Footnote_2713" class="fnanchor">2713</a>
Besides, Airy, not having a really intimate knowledge of the <cite>Commentaries</cite>,
overlooked another important point:&mdash;the Morini did
not act as one undivided state; some only of their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pagi</i>, or sub-divisional
communities, sent ambassadors: others sent none.<a id="FNanchor_2714" href="#Footnote_2714" class="fnanchor">2714</a></p>

<p>Thirdly, Airy refers to Caesar’s statement, that, on returning to
the Portus Itius from his second expedition, he directed Gaius
Fabius to winter in the country of the Morini with one legion.<a id="FNanchor_2715" href="#Footnote_2715" class="fnanchor">2715</a>
‘It appears to me,’ he says, ‘that the order (after his second return)
for legions to march <i>from the Portus Itius</i><a id="FNanchor_2716" href="#Footnote_2716" class="fnanchor">2716</a> “in Morinos” makes it
certain that he was not in their country.’<a id="FNanchor_2717" href="#Footnote_2717" class="fnanchor">2717</a></p>

<p>The words ‘from the Portus Itius’ beg the question. One
legion (not ‘legions’) was sent into the country of the Morini, not
from the Portus Itius but from Samarobriva, in the country of
the Ambiani, where, as the context shows, all the legions were
temporarily assembled.<a id="FNanchor_2718" href="#Footnote_2718" class="fnanchor">2718</a> Similarly in the following year, 53 <small>B.C.</small>,
Caesar concentrated all his legions at Durocortorum, or Reims,
immediately before distributing them in their respective quarters
for the winter.<a id="FNanchor_2719" href="#Footnote_2719" class="fnanchor">2719</a></p>

<p>Fourthly, Airy refers to the well-known passage in which Strabo<a id="FNanchor_2720" href="#Footnote_2720" class="fnanchor">2720</a>
says that ‘the Itian’ [naval station?] is παρὰ (τοῖς Μορινοῖς). Παρά,
he seriously affirms, means ‘near to’, not ‘in’ (the country of the
Morini<a id="FNanchor_2721" href="#Footnote_2721" class="fnanchor">2721</a>).</p>

<p>If Airy’s sense of humour had not been dormant, it would surely
have occurred to him that, in a matter of pure scholarship, it was
unlikely that all Greek scholars should be wrong while he alone was
right. Dr. Guest took the trouble to refute him;<a id="FNanchor_2722" href="#Footnote_2722" class="fnanchor">2722</a> and if he had
referred to other passages in Strabo,<a id="FNanchor_2723" href="#Footnote_2723" class="fnanchor">2723</a> he would have seen for himself
that παρ’ οἷς means ‘in whose country’.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">561</span></p>

<p>Airy was far too vigilant a controversialist not to see that there
were well-grounded objections to his theory; and he attempted
to anticipate them. Caesar, as we have seen, states that when
his fleet was returning to Gaul after the first expedition, two of
the ships failed to make the same harbours as the rest, and ‘were
carried a little lower down’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">duae</i> [naves] <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eosdem quos reliqui portus
capere non potuerunt et paulo infra delatae sunt</i><a id="FNanchor_2724" href="#Footnote_2724" class="fnanchor">2724</a>); and he goes on to
say that the troops who landed from these two ships were attacked
by the Morini while they were marching from the place where they
had disembarked to his own camp. The words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paulo infra delatae
sunt</i> are interpreted by almost every commentator except Airy<a id="FNanchor_2725" href="#Footnote_2725" class="fnanchor">2725</a>
as meaning that the two ships were carried a little further down
the coast than the other ships; and if this interpretation is correct,
it is obvious that the harbours in which the other ships came to land
were in the country of the Morini. But Airy is unmoved by this
consensus of opinion. ‘The word “delatae”,’ he says, ‘is repeatedly
used by Caesar for “drifted”, and “infra delatae” is
“drifted down”, the word “down” apparently relating not to any
geographical direction, but to the force of the wind.’<a id="FNanchor_2726" href="#Footnote_2726" class="fnanchor">2726</a></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Caesar uses the past participle of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">defero</i> in
the sense of ‘drifted’ four times,<a id="FNanchor_2727" href="#Footnote_2727" class="fnanchor">2727</a> namely, in the passage which we
are now considering and in <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, v, 8, § 2 (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">longius delatus aestu
orta luce sub sinistra Britanniam relictam conspexit</i>), <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Civile">B. C.</abbr></cite>, iii, 14, § 2
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">una ex his</i> [navibus] ... <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">delata Oricum atque a Bibulo expugnata est</i>),
and <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Civile">B. C.</abbr></cite>, iii, 30, § 1 (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetervectas Apolloniam Dyrrachiumque naves
viderant ... sed quo essent eae delatae ... ignorabant</i>). None of these
passages lends the slightest support to Airy’s theory; and the other
three passages in which he uses the adverb <i>infra</i><a id="FNanchor_2728" href="#Footnote_2728" class="fnanchor">2728</a> in a local sense,
namely, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, vi, 35, § 6 (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">transeunt Rhenum ... XXX milibus
passuum infra eum locum ubi pons erat perfectus</i><a id="FNanchor_2729" href="#Footnote_2729" class="fnanchor">2729</a>), <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, vii,
61, § 3 (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuntiatur ... magnum ire agmen adverso flumine sonitumque
remorum in eadem parte exaudiri et paulo infra milites navibus transportari</i><a id="FNanchor_2730" href="#Footnote_2730" class="fnanchor">2730</a>),
and <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Civile">B. C.</abbr></cite>, i, 64, § 6 (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reliquas legiones expeditas educit
magnoque numero iumentorum in flumine supra atque infra constituto
traducit exercitum</i><a id="FNanchor_2731" href="#Footnote_2731" class="fnanchor">2731</a>), are fatal to it.</p>

<p>Again, the passage in which Caesar says that the distance from
the Portus Itius to Britain is about 30 [Roman] miles,<a id="FNanchor_2732" href="#Footnote_2732" class="fnanchor">2732</a> assuming
that it is genuine, might well have disconcerted a less resourceful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>
reasoner; for the distance from the mouth of the Somme to St.
Leonards, off which place Airy maintains that Caesar anchored on
his first voyage,<a id="FNanchor_2733" href="#Footnote_2733" class="fnanchor">2733</a> is about 65 Roman miles; and to Pevensey Level,
where he makes Caesar land, a little more. But Airy confidently
grapples with the difficulty. ‘I conceive,’ he remarks, ‘that the
sentence has been mistranslated. The Portus Itius and the continent
are placed in contradistinction. The <i>convenient passage</i> was from
the Portus Itius, the distance of 30 miles was from the continent.’<a id="FNanchor_2734" href="#Footnote_2734" class="fnanchor">2734</a></p>

<p>Read the sentence again,&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">portum Itium ... quo ex portu commodissimum
in Britanniam traiectum esse cognoverat, circiter milium
passuum XXX transmissum a continenti</i>. Classical scholars are
agreed that these words can only mean what Airy insists that they
do not mean, namely, that the distance from the Portus Itius to
Britain was about 30 Roman miles. If not from the Portus Itius,
from what port? What would have been the good of specifying
the distance if Caesar had been thinking of some other port which
he did not use?<a id="FNanchor_2735" href="#Footnote_2735" class="fnanchor">2735</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, the distance from the mouth of the Somme to
Pevensey Level is about twice the distance from Boulogne to Dover,
to Hythe, or to Lympne; and Caesar says that the reason why he
marched for the country of the Morini was that the passage from
their country to Britain was the shortest.</p>

<p>But it would seem that Airy was not quite convinced of the
soundness of his own reasoning. ‘If,’ he says, ‘any reader thinks
that the reasons for excluding the Portus Itius from the land of the
Morini are not sufficiently cogent, the whole is easily reconciled
with the hypothesis that the Portus Itius was the mouth of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">563</span>
Somme by supposing that in the time of Caesar the Morini stretched
south-west of the Somme ... the geography which limits their
territory to the north of the Somme is 120 years later. Any one
who reflects on the change of boundary of Russia, of Prussia, of
Turkey, and of other European States, within a period of much
less than 120 years, will find no difficulty in admitting this change
in the limits of the Morini.’<a id="FNanchor_2736" href="#Footnote_2736" class="fnanchor">2736</a></p>

<p>It is sufficient to answer that there is no analogy between the
political history of Europe in the earlier half of the nineteenth century
and that of Gaul in the 120 years that followed the invasion of Britain
by Caesar. The Gallic peoples during that period were not at war
with one another; and there is not the slightest reason to suppose
that the Morini possessed a wider seaboard in Caesar’s time than
120 years later. Lewin’s reply to Airy is worth quoting<a id="FNanchor_2737" href="#Footnote_2737" class="fnanchor">2737</a>:&mdash;‘He
offers, as a solution of the difficulty, that in the time of Caesar the
Morini stretched south-west of the Somme. If so, then the Somme
itself, from which Caesar sailed, and to which he returned, was,
according to the Astronomer-Royal, in the country of the Morini;
and yet, a few lines before, the Astronomer-Royal had stated that
the order (after Caesar’s second return) for legions to march into the
country of the Morini made it <i>certain</i> that he was <i>not in their country</i>!
Thus to avoid Scylla, it is laid down, as <i>certain</i> that Caesar did not
sail from the Morini; and then, to avoid Charybdis, the reader is
invited to assume that the place of embarkation was amongst the
Morini.’</p>

<p>Finally, Airy affirms that the mouth of the Somme was by far
the best harbour which Caesar could have selected, and that its
capability for his purpose ‘is proved by the ... experience of William
of Normandy, who at one tide floated out of it 1400 ships’.<a id="FNanchor_2738" href="#Footnote_2738" class="fnanchor">2738</a></p>

<p>Now William the Conqueror assembled his fleet and embarked
his army not in the mouth of the Somme but in the mouth of the
Dive:<a id="FNanchor_2739" href="#Footnote_2739" class="fnanchor">2739</a> he was merely obliged, as Lewin says,<a id="FNanchor_2740" href="#Footnote_2740" class="fnanchor">2740</a> ‘to take temporary
shelter ... at the mouth of the Somme.’ But this blunder is of no
great consequence. The Somme might have served Caesar’s purpose
if only it had not been twice as far from that part of Britain to which
he intended to go as Boulogne.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg563">VI. AMBLETEUSE</h3>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Commission de la Topographie des Gaules</i><a id="FNanchor_2741" href="#Footnote_2741" class="fnanchor">2741</a> identify the Portus
Itius with Ambleteuse; and Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_2742" href="#Footnote_2742" class="fnanchor">2742</a> is disposed to agree with
them. They argue that Strabo<a id="FNanchor_2743" href="#Footnote_2743" class="fnanchor">2743</a> affirms the existence of two ports
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">564</span>
in the country of the Morini; that one of the two was evidently
Gesoriacum; and that the Portus Itius was therefore something
different. The passage in Strabo to which the commission refers
will be most conveniently examined in a later section.<a id="FNanchor_2744" href="#Footnote_2744" class="fnanchor">2744</a> Meanwhile
it is enough to say that if it proves that the Portus Itius was not
Gesoriacum, it does not prove that the Portus Itius was Ambleteuse.</p>

<p>General Creuly<a id="FNanchor_2745" href="#Footnote_2745" class="fnanchor">2745</a> decides for Ambleteuse on the ground that its
distance from Wissant corresponds with Caesar’s statement of the
distance which separated his own port of embarkation from the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i>, and that the intervention of Cape Grisnez between
Ambleteuse and Wissant would have justified Caesar in describing
the latter as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i>. He remarks that if the Portus
Itius is identified with Boulogne, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i> must have been
Ambleteuse. But, referring to Vergil’s well-known line&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tendebantque
manus ripae ulterioris amore</i><a id="FNanchor_2746" href="#Footnote_2746" class="fnanchor">2746</a>&mdash;he argues that the word
<i>ulterior</i> implies the intervention between the Portus Itius and the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i> of an ‘objet disjonctif’, such as a promontory; and
he insists that no such ‘objet’ intervenes between Boulogne and
Ambleteuse. But Heller<a id="FNanchor_2747" href="#Footnote_2747" class="fnanchor">2747</a> observes that a passage in the <cite>Germania</cite><a id="FNanchor_2748" href="#Footnote_2748" class="fnanchor">2748</a>
of Tacitus&mdash;(Gerunt et ferarum pelles), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proximi ripae negligenter,
ulteriores exquisitius</i>&mdash;would seem to show that <i>ulterior</i> means
much the same as <i>longinquior</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2749" href="#Footnote_2749" class="fnanchor">2749</a> Besides, if the distance from
Ambleteuse to Wissant justifies us in identifying Ambleteuse with
the Portus Itius and Wissant with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i>, the distance
from Boulogne to Ambleteuse, as I shall presently show, equally
justifies us in identifying Boulogne with the Portus Itius and
Ambleteuse with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2750" href="#Footnote_2750" class="fnanchor">2750</a></p>

<p>Not a single valid argument ever has been or can be adduced in
favour of Ambleteuse. The harbour is far too small to have contained
Caesar’s fleet; and the merest tiro in his army could have
decided at a glance between its merits and those of Boulogne.<a id="FNanchor_2751" href="#Footnote_2751" class="fnanchor">2751</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span></p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg565a">VII. CALAIS</h3>

<p>I only consider the claims of Calais because their one modern
advocate, General von Göler,<a id="FNanchor_2752" href="#Footnote_2752" class="fnanchor">2752</a> was a distinguished Caesarian scholar.
There is no evidence that Calais was ever used as a harbour in,
or for twelve centuries after, the time of Caesar. If Caesar started
from the Portus Itius on his first expedition, it is impossible, on the
theory that Calais was the Portus Itius, to find the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i>.
Moreover, it would have been impossible for Caesar to sail, on his
second expedition, from Calais to any point of the Kentish coast
between Walmer and Sandwich.<a id="FNanchor_2753" href="#Footnote_2753" class="fnanchor">2753</a> For, as the wind was from the
south-west, he would have had to sail within seven points and a half
of the wind on a flood tide, which would have tended to carry him
into the North Sea, and with shallow flat-bottomed vessels which
made excessive lee-way.<a id="FNanchor_2754" href="#Footnote_2754" class="fnanchor">2754</a> Finally, Calais Harbour is not natural
but artificial; and it is certain that it did not exist in the time of
Caesar.<a id="FNanchor_2755" href="#Footnote_2755" class="fnanchor">2755</a></p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg565b">VIII. WISSANT</h3>

<p>Wissant is between Cape Grisnez and Cape Blancnez, both of
which, in Caesar’s time, projected somewhat further out to sea than
they do now.<a id="FNanchor_2756" href="#Footnote_2756" class="fnanchor">2756</a> Dr. Guest argues that the sandy waste, more than
two miles long and varying in breadth from a quarter to half a mile,
which lies between the uplands and the sand-hills, was once covered
by the sea;<a id="FNanchor_2757" href="#Footnote_2757" class="fnanchor">2757</a> and he conjectures that the ‘pool-harbour’ thus formed
communicated with the English Channel by ‘the gap through which
flows the Rieu des Aiguilles’, a rivulet which crosses the sandy
plain. At the same time he admits that it is very difficult to say
what the limits of the ancient harbour were.<a id="FNanchor_2758" href="#Footnote_2758" class="fnanchor">2758</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span></p>

<p>Dr. Guest’s theory, which was regarded by Mr. Freeman and Dean
Merivale as conclusive, is a theory and nothing more. Mariette,
the famous Egyptologist, states that the dunes themselves (without
which Dr. Guest’s harbour could not have been) were not formed
before the time of Edward the Third;<a id="FNanchor_2759" href="#Footnote_2759" class="fnanchor">2759</a> and M. H. Rigaux concludes,
from a recent minute exploration of the coast between Cape Grisnez
and Sangatte, that the dune which extends from the ‘ruisseau de
Guiptun’, near Tardinghem, to the ‘ruisseau d’Herlan’ at Wissant
did not exist in Caesar’s day.<a id="FNanchor_2760" href="#Footnote_2760" class="fnanchor">2760</a> Moreover, pottery, pre-Roman and
Roman, has been found in the sand behind the dunes between
Wissant and Tardinghem as well as east of Wissant;<a id="FNanchor_2761" href="#Footnote_2761" class="fnanchor">2761</a> numerous
finds have proved that the coast between Sangatte and Dunkirk
has undergone subsidence and extended further seaward in Roman
times than now;<a id="FNanchor_2762" href="#Footnote_2762" class="fnanchor">2762</a> and it may be concluded that the sandy plain at
Wissant was not then covered by the sea. It would appear, then,
that Dr. Guest’s pool-harbour was imaginary. Haigneré,<a id="FNanchor_2763" href="#Footnote_2763" class="fnanchor">2763</a> moreover,
remarks that if there ever had been such a harbour, it must have
been speedily choked up by sand blown from the very dunes which
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex hypothesi</i> formed it; and this argument is confirmed by the fact
that irruptions of blown sand, before the dunes were ‘fixed’ by
being planted with coarse grass, engulfed many buildings at Wissant.<a id="FNanchor_2764" href="#Footnote_2764" class="fnanchor">2764</a>
It has, however, been pointed out by Mr. E. C. H. Day<a id="FNanchor_2765" href="#Footnote_2765" class="fnanchor">2765</a> that ‘a shoal
having less than a fathom of water on it at the lowest tides, extends
from Cape Grisnez, in a north-easterly direction, in such a manner
as to cut off a channel about half a mile in width, and having a
depth of from two to three fathoms of water in it, directly abreast
of Wissant. The shoal,’ he adds, ‘during the course of centuries
of exposure to the heavy seas that break upon the coast, must have
undergone some considerable amount of destruction. Formerly,
therefore, this shoal must have formed a natural breakwater, and
have rendered the channel within it a convenient harbour.’ But,
assuming the correctness of Mr. Day’s deduction, this ‘harbour’
would have been exposed to the fury both of the west and of the north-east
wind. M. Léon Lejeal,<a id="FNanchor_2766" href="#Footnote_2766" class="fnanchor">2766</a> who tells us that a French engineer,
M. J. Voisin, supposes that the shoal was once connected with the
mainland, and thus formed a partially-sheltered harbour, concludes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span>
that there is nothing to show that it was large enough to shelter
the fleet ‘que voulut y ancrer l’imagination d’une archéologie en
délire’;<a id="FNanchor_2767" href="#Footnote_2767" class="fnanchor">2767</a> and M. Leblanc, who in the year 1863 was engineer of
the port of Calais and was intimately acquainted with the geology
of Wissant, ridicules such a notion. ‘Toutes les fois,’ he remarks,
‘que j’allais de Calais au Gris-Nez ... je traversais Wissant, en
étudiant cette question, et je me disais à moi-même: quelle preuve
peut on avoir d’une pareille absurdité?’<a id="FNanchor_2768" href="#Footnote_2768" class="fnanchor">2768</a> Hariulf, a chronicler
who lived in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, described the
harbour of Wissant as an ‘inlet’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ingressum maris</i>),<a id="FNanchor_2769" href="#Footnote_2769" class="fnanchor">2769</a> which would
seem to imply that it was simply a creek formed by one of the
rivulets which meander across the sand. Henry, the historian of
Boulogne, who was bent upon proving the identity of Wissant with
the Portus Itius, would certainly have anticipated Guest’s theory
if he could have done so with truth; but, after a careful examination
of the site, he came to the conclusion that Caesar’s ships must have
been drawn up on an exposed beach.<a id="FNanchor_2770" href="#Footnote_2770" class="fnanchor">2770</a></p>

<p>1. Long<a id="FNanchor_2771" href="#Footnote_2771" class="fnanchor">2771</a> argues that the distance of Wissant from Sangatte
corresponds with the distance between the port from which Caesar
started on his first expedition and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">superior portus</i>; that its
distance from the English coast agrees ‘at least as well as any other
place’ with Caesar’s estimate of the distance from the Portus Itius
to Britain; that its name, which [according to Michel Baudrand,<a id="FNanchor_2772" href="#Footnote_2772" class="fnanchor">2772</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">568</span>
a writer of the seventeenth, century] French sailors used to call
Esseu and the Flemings Isten, ‘is near enough to Itius to add to
the probability of the identity of the two places’; that there are
traces of a Roman road from Wissant to Thérouanne; that in the
neighbourhood of Wissant ‘fresh water was abundant, the soil rich,
and the beach the best that there could be for such ships as Caesar’s’;
and that, if Wissant was not, strictly speaking, a port at all, ‘Caesar
did not want a port in the modern sense of the word. He wanted
his ships at the nearest place to Britain.... His vessels would be
hauled up on the beach till the wind was fair. He had no port on
the British coast, and he hauled up all his ships after they were
damaged by a storm.’ ‘This long sandy beach,’ he says, ‘was the
best place along all this coast for Caesar’s purpose.’<a id="FNanchor_2773" href="#Footnote_2773" class="fnanchor">2773</a></p>

<p>Of these arguments the first, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i>, is equally applicable
to Boulogne. The argument from nomenclature is worthless:<a id="FNanchor_2774" href="#Footnote_2774" class="fnanchor">2774</a>
‘Wissant’ is not derived from ‘Itius’; it is said to be merely a
corruption of ‘Weiss-sand’ (Whitesand).<a id="FNanchor_2775" href="#Footnote_2775" class="fnanchor">2775</a> There is no evidence
for the alleged Roman road. The Roman road which, according to
Henry,<a id="FNanchor_2776" href="#Footnote_2776" class="fnanchor">2776</a> led from Thérouanne to Wissant, really led to Sangatte.<a id="FNanchor_2777" href="#Footnote_2777" class="fnanchor">2777</a>
Dr. Guest, who carefully explored Wissant and its neighbourhood,
found that the soil, which Long calls ‘rich’, is ‘notoriously barren’.<a id="FNanchor_2778" href="#Footnote_2778" class="fnanchor">2778</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">569</span>
And, in reply to the last of Long’s arguments, it is sufficient to say
that, although Caesar did perforce beach his ships on the coast of
Britain, yet he suffered heavily from not having a port; and the
mere fact that he sent Volusenus to ascertain what ports on the
British coast were capable of accommodating a large fleet proves
that his original intention was to land in a port, and not on an open
beach. Long’s assertion, that the beach at Wissant ‘was the best
place along all this coast for Caesar’s purpose’, Dr. Guest, who agrees
with him in identifying the Portus Itius with Wissant, treats with
utter scorn; but his criticism is founded upon the groundless
assumption that the sand-dune between Wissant and Tardinghem
then existed.<a id="FNanchor_2779" href="#Footnote_2779" class="fnanchor">2779</a> However, Long admits that ‘it would not be possible
<i>now</i> to draw up a fleet like Caesar’s on the beach’. ‘But,’ he persists,
‘if there have been such great changes on this coast that Dr.
Guest’s huge harbour is filled up, why may not my beach have
undergone some change also?’<a id="FNanchor_2780" href="#Footnote_2780" class="fnanchor">2780</a> The reply is obvious. What
Long calls ‘my beach’ may have undergone changes: but, unless
it can be proved not only that ships could have been hauled up on
the beach of Wissant in Caesar’s time, but also that there then
existed at Wissant a harbour large enough to accommodate Caesar’s
fleet, the claim of Wissant to be identified with the Portus Itius
cannot be admitted.</p>

<p>But Long is not the only writer who maintains that the Portus
Itius was not a port properly so called; and this question is so important
that we must fairly examine the arguments that have been
adduced in support of Long’s view.</p>

<p>Heller argues that since Caesar beached his ships on his return
from the second expedition, we may conclude that the Portus Itius
was not a harbour in the strict sense, as, if the shelter of a harbour
had been available, he would not have taken the trouble to draw
them up on shore.<a id="FNanchor_2781" href="#Footnote_2781" class="fnanchor">2781</a></p>

<p>But Heller forgets that the ancients never left their ships at anchor
for any lengthened period, but invariably laid them up high and
dry for the winter.<a id="FNanchor_2782" href="#Footnote_2782" class="fnanchor">2782</a> Moreover, if eight hundred ships had been
beached at Wissant, would it not have been necessary, in order to
protect them from storm-driven spring tides, to construct an
enormous naval camp, the earth necessary for which did not exist?</p>

<p>Professor Ridgeway insists that, if Strabo is to be believed, the
Portus Itius can only be identified with Wissant.<a id="FNanchor_2783" href="#Footnote_2783" class="fnanchor">2783</a> Strabo<a id="FNanchor_2784" href="#Footnote_2784" class="fnanchor">2784</a> calls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">570</span>
Caesar’s place of embarkation τὸ Ἴτιον. This word, the professor
observes, is obviously an adjective, and, as it agrees with a neuter
word understood, it cannot agree with λιμήν or κόλπος (a harbour),
but must agree with ἄκρον or ἀκρωτήριον (a headland). Evidently,
then, Strabo’s τὸ Ἴτιον is the same as Ptolemy’s Ἴτιον ἄκρον. Similarly
Strabo<a id="FNanchor_2785" href="#Footnote_2785" class="fnanchor">2785</a> speaks of Cape Finisterre as Νέριον,, while Ptolemy<a id="FNanchor_2786" href="#Footnote_2786" class="fnanchor">2786</a> calls it
Νέριον ἀκρωτήριον. Now Strabo does not call Ἴτιον a harbour,
but only a roadstead ναύσταθμον, a term which Thucydides<a id="FNanchor_2787" href="#Footnote_2787" class="fnanchor">2787</a>
applies to Cape Malea. Thus, if Strabo was right, the Portus
Itius was the roadstead sheltered by the Itian promontory.</p>

<p>The professor’s argument is not convincing. Granted that Ἴτιον
must agree with ἄκρον, on him lies the burden of proving that the
headland in question was not Cap d’Alprech, which shelters the
estuary of the Liane, and the geographical position of which corresponds
closely enough with that which Ptolemy assigns to Ἴτιον
ἄκρον.<a id="FNanchor_2788" href="#Footnote_2788" class="fnanchor">2788</a> When the professor remarks<a id="FNanchor_2789" href="#Footnote_2789" class="fnanchor">2789</a> that ‘the advocates of both
Wissant and Boulogne support the claim of Grisnez’ against Alprech
he is mistaken. Desjardins is only one of many French writers
who ‘support the claim’ of Alprech against Grisnez. Moreover,
supposing that the professor is right in identifying the Itian promontory
with Grisnez, he is wrong in assuming that the word
ναύσταθμον necessarily excludes the idea of a harbour. Sometimes
it is used to denote a port already described as a λιμήν, or harbour
properly so called, in order to draw attention to the fact that that
harbour was a naval station. Thus Strabo,<a id="FNanchor_2790" href="#Footnote_2790" class="fnanchor">2790</a> immediately after
mentioning the Piraeus and the other two harbours of Athens,
says that the ναύσταθμον was capable of accommodating the four
hundred ships which composed the Athenian fleet. And Pausanias,<a id="FNanchor_2791" href="#Footnote_2791" class="fnanchor">2791</a>
speaking of Nauplia, the port of Argos, which, according to Strabo,<a id="FNanchor_2792" href="#Footnote_2792" class="fnanchor">2792</a>
was the ναύσταθμον of the Argives, says, ‘there are harbours in
Nauplia’ (λιμένες εἰσὶν ἐν Ναυπλίᾳ).<a id="FNanchor_2793" href="#Footnote_2793" class="fnanchor">2793</a> To anybody who knows
anything about ancient navigation, the suggestion that Caesar
would have kept 800 ships riding at anchor for several weeks in an
open roadstead, exposed to the fury of the north-west wind, while,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">571</span>
a few miles off in the Liane, there was an ample sheltered harbour
available, must appear simply ridiculous. And, assuming that
Strabo did intend to convey that τὸ Ἴτιον was merely a roadstead,
the answer is that Strabo is refuted by Caesar, who says that his
ships assembled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad portum Itium</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2794" href="#Footnote_2794" class="fnanchor">2794</a>&mdash;‘in the Itian harbour.’ The
Portus Itius must have been a port, properly so called; and the
more discerning advocates of Wissant naturally accept this view.<a id="FNanchor_2795" href="#Footnote_2795" class="fnanchor">2795</a></p>

<p>Long maintains, further, that, although Caesar does not say
directly that the passage from the Portus Itius to Britain was
actually the shortest, yet he does so indirectly; for he tells us
that he went to the country of the Morini ‘because the shortest
passage to Britain was from their country’; and the port in their
country which he selected was the Portus Itius.<a id="FNanchor_2796" href="#Footnote_2796" class="fnanchor">2796</a> But, as all who
are familiar with the <cite>Commentaries</cite> will admit, Long throws an
undue strain upon Caesar’s language. Caesar tells us, in general
terms, that the shortest passage to Britain was from the country of
the Morini: but it is bad logic to conclude from this statement
that the passage from the Portus Itius must have been actually the
shortest as the crow flies. Caesar would never have chosen the
passage which was in this sense the shortest if it had been on other
grounds objectionable: obviously what he meant to say was that
of the regular passages to Britain that from the country of the Morini
was the shortest; and the passage from the Portus Itius being, as he
says, ‘the most convenient,’ was, for all practical purposes, the
shortest.</p>

<p>It is clear, then, that Long failed to establish the identity of the
Portus Itius with Wissant. Let us see what better informed advocates
of the same theory have to say.</p>

<p>2. Not to mention the arguments which are common to him and
Long, Dr. Guest gives the following reasons for his belief:&mdash;that
the (assumed) harbour of Wissant was large enough to hold Caesar’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">572</span>
fleet; that it lay beneath Cape Grisnez, which he identifies with
the Itian promontory; and that William of Poitiers, a chronicler
of the eleventh century, called it ‘Portus Icius’.<a id="FNanchor_2797" href="#Footnote_2797" class="fnanchor">2797</a> He will not admit
that William was simply stating his own opinion: ‘I think,’ he
says, ‘this name may have been handed down to him by the Romanised
Gauls, inasmuch as the name of Ician seems to have been long
kept afloat in the recollection of the Celtic population of these
islands’; and he points out that ‘the old Irish name for the English
Channel is <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Muir n’ Icht</i>’, or ‘the Itian sea’. But the fact on which
he lays most stress is the proximity of Wissant to Cape Grisnez.
He freely admits, indeed, that Cap d’Alprech may, in Caesar’s
time, have been a more considerable promontory than it is at
present;<a id="FNanchor_2798" href="#Footnote_2798" class="fnanchor">2798</a> but he cannot conceive that the promontory which Ptolemy
selected for especial mention should have been any other than the
famous cape which is and must always have been the most conspicuous
feature of the north-eastern coast of France, and which marks the
point where the coast, making a sharp angle, begins to trend towards
the east. ‘Cape Grisnez,’ he concludes, ‘there can hardly be a
doubt, was the Ician promontory, and if so, the great port which
lay beneath it must have been the Ician Port.’<a id="FNanchor_2799" href="#Footnote_2799" class="fnanchor">2799</a></p>

<p>‘The great port which lay beneath it,’&mdash;these words, Dr. Guest,
beg the whole question. That the harbour of Wissant was large
enough to hold Caesar’s fleet would be true, if Dr. Guest’s conjectural
tracing of its outline were <i>correct</i>: but the fact, if it were a fact,
would simply remove one of the objections which have been brought
against Wissant; it would not prove that Wissant was the Portus
Itius. For the harbour of Boulogne was also large enough, and
was also, as will presently appear, in other respects far more convenient.
The argument that William of Poitiers called Wissant
the Portus Itius has no weight. Maistre Wace, who wrote about
a century after William of Poitiers, believed that Caesar had sailed
from Boulogne.<a id="FNanchor_2800" href="#Footnote_2800" class="fnanchor">2800</a> Moreover, Hericus, a monk of the ninth century,<a id="FNanchor_2801" href="#Footnote_2801" class="fnanchor">2801</a>
identified Bibracte with Autun; but it is now universally admitted,
and it is certain, that Hericus was wrong.<a id="FNanchor_2802" href="#Footnote_2802" class="fnanchor">2802</a> It may be admitted
that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> it would seem much more likely that the Itian promontory
was Cape Grisnez than that it was Cap d’Alprech; but if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">573</span>
the former identification is to be accepted, it is necessary to assume
that Ptolemy made a gross blunder. It is of course quite true,
as Dr. Guest says,<a id="FNanchor_2803" href="#Footnote_2803" class="fnanchor">2803</a> that Ptolemy did make mistakes; but still the
fact remains that the geographical position which he assigns to the
Itian promontory is, allowing for a slight error in longitude, that of
Cap d’Alprech. As Mr. Peskett puts it, ‘Ptolemy, proceeding
northward, places the headland between the Somme and Boulogne’;<a id="FNanchor_2804" href="#Footnote_2804" class="fnanchor">2804</a>
and I may add that if you only know Cap d’Alprech by the map,
you will be surprised, when you actually see it, to find how bold
a headland it is. Moreover, even if Ptolemy was mistaken, it does
not follow that the Itian harbour was Wissant. Professor Rhys,
who believes that the Gauls as well as the Irish called the Channel
‘the sea of Icht’, remarks that ‘in that case Portus Ictius would
designate Caesar’s place of embarcation, somewhat in the same way
that Dover might in English be termed the Channel Harbour. The
former probably had a Gaulish name of its own, which may have
become the Latin one also as soon as the Romans began to be a
little more at home in the north of Gaul; so that it would be labour
in vain to try to detect <i>Ictius</i> in any place-name still current on the
French coast.’<a id="FNanchor_2805" href="#Footnote_2805" class="fnanchor">2805</a> Let us, however, assume, for the sake of argument,
that Professor Rhys is mistaken. Even then it does not follow that
the Portus Itius was Wissant. For it will not be denied that Boulogne
was, in Caesar’s time as in the time of the emperors, a frequented
harbour; and it is certain that Wissant was not a harbour capable
of containing Caesar’s fleet. Therefore Boulogne, which is only
nine statute miles south of Cape Grisnez, was obviously the nearest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">574</span>
important harbour to that promontory. Why, then, if Cape
Grisnez was the Itian promontory, should Boulogne not have been
called the Itian harbour? Even on the desperate theory that when
Caesar spoke of a harbour, he did not mean a harbour but only
a roadstead, that roadstead was not at Wissant; for if Caesar’s
ships had waited there, either at anchor or on the beach, exposed
to the north-west winds for twenty-five days, they would have been
in extreme peril.</p>

<p>Dr. Guest admits of course that Boulogne, not Wissant, was the
permanent harbour of the Romans in North-Eastern Gaul under the
empire; but in this fact he sees no objection to his theory. He
believes that the Romans, when they had to choose a permanent
harbour, rejected Wissant and chose Boulogne because of the
sterility of the country in the neighbourhood of the former. ‘Wissant,’
he remarks, ‘or rather the port adjacent to Wissant, may have
answered Caesar’s purpose, when he had hundreds of ships to supply
the wants of his commissariat; but when a port was to be provided
to meet the ordinary purposes of traffic, it was necessary to select
one that possessed local resources.’<a id="FNanchor_2806" href="#Footnote_2806" class="fnanchor">2806</a></p>

<p>The reason which Dr. Guest gives for the choice of Boulogne is
sound enough as far as it goes; but what support does it lend to
the theory that Caesar used Wissant as a temporary harbour?
The sterility of the neighbourhood would hardly have recommended
it. It must have had some great advantage to compensate for this
defect if it was really to be preferred, even as a temporary harbour,
to Boulogne. But it is impossible to point out one single advantage
which Wissant could have had, for Caesar’s purpose, over Boulogne,
save only that, as the crow flies, it was a little nearer to Britain.</p>

<p>Dr. Guest, indeed, assures us that ‘Caesar had no time for weighing
the comparative merits of the ports north and south of him, and for
determining which of them was “the most convenient”’.<a id="FNanchor_2807" href="#Footnote_2807" class="fnanchor">2807</a> No
time! Had he not five days to spare for Volusenus’s reconnaissance?
A single day would have sufficed to ride along the coast
from Wissant to Boulogne; a few minutes spent at each of those
places would have sufficed ‘for determining which of them was “the
most convenient”’: but the greatest general of Rome could not
spare even one day for a duty which the worst would not have
neglected; so he pitched upon Wissant, because, as Dr. Guest tells
us, ‘it afforded him the shortest passage’! So argued the man who,
according to Freeman, ‘settled the whole matter,’ the man who,
from Freeman’s point of view, appeared to stand, side by side with
Stubbs, ‘at the head of living students of English history.’<a id="FNanchor_2808" href="#Footnote_2808" class="fnanchor">2808</a></p>

<p>3. Heller is not as ardent an advocate of Wissant as Guest; but
he has written some very ingenious papers in defence of Guest’s
view. Many of his reasons are virtually identical with those of the
English scholar; but from Caesar’s narrative of his second voyage he
deduces a fresh argument, which deserves special attention. Caesar,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">575</span>
as we have seen, set sail about sunset with a light south-westerly
wind. About midnight the wind dropped: the fleet, borne by the
tide, drifted out of its course;<a id="FNanchor_2809" href="#Footnote_2809" class="fnanchor">2809</a> and ‘at daybreak Caesar saw
Britain lying behind on the port quarter’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">orta luce sub sinistra
Britanniam relictam conspexit</i><a id="FNanchor_2810" href="#Footnote_2810" class="fnanchor">2810</a>). From the last statement Heller
infers that Caesar’s ship must have drifted to some point off the
North Foreland: otherwise, he argues, the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">relictam</i> would be
meaningless. For, he remarks, Caesar believed that one side of
Britain faced the north. Therefore it must be assumed that he
had no knowledge of that part of the coast which trends northward
beyond the mouth of the Thames: he must have thought that the
coast, at the North Foreland, turned sharply towards the west.
Otherwise he could not have believed that he had left Britain
behind; nor could he have believed this unless he had drifted to
some point off the North Foreland. Now Caesar started on his
voyage about the 6th of July.<a id="FNanchor_2811" href="#Footnote_2811" class="fnanchor">2811</a> On that day the sun set about
8.16; and on the following morning it rose about 3.54. There
must have been light enough to show the British coast as early as
3.15 or 3.20. Heller maintains that Caesar could by daybreak
have reached a point about 2 German [or 9½ English] miles south-east
of the North Foreland, not quite as far north as the latitude
of Ramsgate, if he had sailed from Wissant; but he insists that if
he had sailed from Boulogne, he could not have drifted further northward
than the latitude of Deal, in which case he could not have said
that he ‘saw Britain left <i>behind</i> on the port quarter’.<a id="FNanchor_2812" href="#Footnote_2812" class="fnanchor">2812</a></p>

<p>This argument rests upon a strained interpretation of the word
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">relictam</i>. It is probably true that Caesar could not have drifted
as far north as the latitude of Ramsgate if he had sailed from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">576</span>
Boulogne;<a id="FNanchor_2813" href="#Footnote_2813" class="fnanchor">2813</a> but even if he had only drifted as far north as the
latitude of Walmer, he would have been perfectly justified in using
the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">relictam</i>. For that word does not imply that Caesar
believed himself to have left the <i>northern</i> coast of Britain behind:
it simply implies that, as the current was carrying him in a north-easterly
direction<a id="FNanchor_2814" href="#Footnote_2814" class="fnanchor">2814</a> and therefore sweeping him every minute further
and further away from Britain, ‘he saw Britain lying behind on the
port quarter.’ There is a parallel passage in the twenty-first chapter
of the <cite>Acts of the Apostles</cite>, which shows that this was his meaning.
In the second and third verses of that chapter the writer, after
describing the voyage of himself and St. Paul from Ephesus by
way of Cos and Rhodes to Patara, says, ‘Having found a ship
crossing over unto Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail. And
<i>when we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand</i>, we
sailed unto Syria, and landed at Tyre’ (καὶ εὑρόντες πλοῖον διαπερῶν
εἰς Φοινίκην ἐπιβάντες ἀνήχθημεν, ἀναφάναντες δὲ τὴν Κύπρον καὶ καταλιπόντες
αὐτὴν εὐώνυμον ἐπλέομεν εἰς Συρίαν καὶ κατήλθομεν εἰς Τύρον).
If the reader will look at his map, he will see that the writer of the
<i>Acts</i>, when he came in sight of Cyprus and left it on the left hand,
was in precisely the same position with regard to Cyprus as Caesar
would have been in with regard to Britain if, drifting in a north-easterly
direction, he had descried the coast of Britain from some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">577</span>
point in the latitude of Deal.<a id="FNanchor_2815" href="#Footnote_2815" class="fnanchor">2815</a> And if Heller will use his common
sense he will see that if a ship about the latitude of Deal were
drifting away from Britain, that ship would have left Britain behind
just as really as if it had passed Cape Wrath and were drifting towards
Iceland.</p>

<p>Lastly, even if Heller’s explanation of the word <i>relictam</i> were
correct, the argument which he builds upon it would be unsound;
for obviously that argument would only hold good if Caesar had
drifted north of the latitude of the North Foreland. Heller himself
admits that he had hardly drifted so far north as the latitude of
Ramsgate; and at this point, on Heller’s own theory, he could no
more have said that he had left <i>the northern coast</i> of Britain <i>behind</i>
than if he had been in the latitude of Deal.</p>

<p>Both Heller<a id="FNanchor_2816" href="#Footnote_2816" class="fnanchor">2816</a> and Guest<a id="FNanchor_2817" href="#Footnote_2817" class="fnanchor">2817</a> deduce an argument in favour of Wissant
from a well-known passage of Strabo.<a id="FNanchor_2818" href="#Footnote_2818" class="fnanchor">2818</a> It runs as follows:&mdash;‘There
are four regular passages from the Continent to the island,
namely, from the mouths of the Rhine, the Seine, the Loire, and the
Garonne. People who cross from the country near the Rhine do
not sail from the mouth of that river, but from the country of the
Morini ... <i>and</i> in their country is the Itian (harbour), which Caesar
used as his naval station, when he was crossing to the island’ (τέτταρα
δ’ ἐστὶ διάρματα, οἷς χρῶνται συνήθως ἐπὶ τὴν νῆσον ἐκ τῆς ἠπείρου, τὰ
ἀπὸ τῶν ἐκβολῶν τῶν ποταμῶν, τοῦ τε Ῥήνου καὶ τοῦ Σηκοάνα καὶ τοῦ
Λείγηρος καὶ τοῦ Γαρούνα. τοῖς δ’ ἀπὸ τῶν περὶ τὸν Ῥῆνον τόπων
ἀναγομένοις οὐκ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν τῶν ἐκβολῶν ὁ πλοῦς ἐστιν, ἀλλὰ ἀπὸ τῶν
ὁμορούντων τοῖς Μεναπίοις Μορινῶν, παρ’ οἷς ἐστι καὶ τὸ Ἴτιον, ᾧ
ἐχρήσατο ναυστάθμῳ Καῖσαρ ὁ θεός, διαίρων εἰς τὴν νῆσον). I have
italicized the word <i>and</i>, because the meaning of καί has been disputed.
Dr. Guest argues that the port from which the inhabitants
of the country near the Rhine sailed must have been Boulogne;
and, he continues, ‘every unprejudiced reader ... will be of opinion
that he (Strabo) distinguishes it from his “Itium”.’ In other words,
Guest would translate the doubtful clause by ‘in whose country
there is <i>also</i> the Itian (harbour)’.</p>

<p>I, for one, fully agree with Dr. Guest; but some scholars are
unable to do so. Long,<a id="FNanchor_2819" href="#Footnote_2819" class="fnanchor">2819</a> remarking that a similar use of καί, particularly
in clauses which begin with a relative, as παρ’ οἷς, is common
in Strabo and also in Thucydides, affirms that ‘the purpose of καί,
when it is so used, is to mark emphatically some thing or circumstance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">578</span>
in addition to one which has been mentioned’. Guest<a id="FNanchor_2820" href="#Footnote_2820" class="fnanchor">2820</a>
retorts that Xylander, in his Latin version of Strabo, first published
in Casaubon’s edition of 1597, and revised by Siebenkees, who did
not alter Xylander’s translation of the passage in question, and
Groskurd, in his German version of 1831&mdash;‘the most careful and
conscientious translation of Strabo that has yet appeared’&mdash;both
render καί by ‘also’. This array of authorities does not disconcert
Long. He remarks<a id="FNanchor_2821" href="#Footnote_2821" class="fnanchor">2821</a> that the old Latin versions of Strabo and other
Greek writers, although they were very useful in their day, ‘are not
of much value when there is any great difficulty.’ Groskurd’s
translation&mdash;‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">wo auch der Hafen Ition ist</span>’&mdash;he regards as ambiguous.
Had Groskurd desired to express, in his translation, that Strabo
meant to affirm the existence of another harbour, besides those
which he had just mentioned, he would have written, not ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">wo <i>auch</i></span>’,
but ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">wo <i>ebenfalls</i></span>’ (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">der Hafen Ition ist</span>). But, says Long, ‘Strabo
mentions four usual points of transit from Gallia to Britain, and
if in this passage he means that there was another besides the Itius,
then there would be five points of transit instead of four, and Strabo
would contradict himself.’<a id="FNanchor_2822" href="#Footnote_2822" class="fnanchor">2822</a> Long then quotes two passages in
support of his interpretation of καί. ‘Strabo,’ he remarks, ‘says
that Sinuessa is in the gulf of Setia, and adds ἀφ’ οὗ καὶ τὸ ὄνομα.<a id="FNanchor_2823" href="#Footnote_2823" class="fnanchor">2823</a>
Groskurd translates καί by “auch”, which has no meaning here....
Again, Strabo, speaking of the high Alps, says περὶ ὃ δὴ καὶ συνίσταντο
οἱ λῃσταί;<a id="FNanchor_2824" href="#Footnote_2824" class="fnanchor">2824</a> which Groskurd translates, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">die Gipfel, um welche
denn auch die Räuber sassen</span>.” Xylander simply says “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">ubi degebant
latrones</span>”, which I prefer to Groskurd’s version, though
Xylander’s version is not quite exact.’</p>

<p>To these arguments Guest made no reply; but Heller<a id="FNanchor_2825" href="#Footnote_2825" class="fnanchor">2825</a> did so.
He admits that Thucydides, in relative sentences, often did use καί
in the sense which Long claims for it; but this sense, he maintains,
is restricted to phrases of which the meaning is unmistakable.</p>

<p>If Strabo did really mean to say that the Itian port was different
from that port of the Morini which was commonly used as the point
of departure for Britain, then I can only say that I believe, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">579</span>
Rudolf Schneider,<a id="FNanchor_2826" href="#Footnote_2826" class="fnanchor">2826</a> that Strabo was mistaken. As Caesar was the
only other ancient writer who mentioned the Portus Itius, and as he
did not say exactly where it was, it would have been quite natural
for Strabo to suppose that the Portus Itius was not the same as
the well-known port of the Morini.</p>

<p>4. Finally, it has been affirmed by Henry<a id="FNanchor_2827" href="#Footnote_2827" class="fnanchor">2827</a> and many other writers
that the so-called ‘Camp de César’ and the various hillocks known
as ‘mottes’ which are to be found in the neighbourhood of Wissant
were defensive works erected by Caesar or his lieutenants for the
protection of the Portus Itius; and de Saulcy tells us that an
inhabitant of Wissant, whose trustworthiness he had proved, informed
him that about two kilometres north-east of the village,
at Haute-Sombre, there existed a camp several hectares in extent,
in which, he says, ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">il faudra reconnaître le camp des trois légions
et des deux mille cavaliers de Labienus</span>.’<a id="FNanchor_2828" href="#Footnote_2828" class="fnanchor">2828</a></p>

<p>All these allegations have been disproved. The so-called tradition
which ascribed the ‘Camp de César’ to the invader of Britain
originated in the eighteenth century:<a id="FNanchor_2829" href="#Footnote_2829" class="fnanchor">2829</a> at all events it is not mentioned
by any of the earlier advocates of Wissant; and the camp has
been proved to be of post-Roman date.<a id="FNanchor_2830" href="#Footnote_2830" class="fnanchor">2830</a> Moreover, its area is not
more than 50 ares 30 centiares, or 6,016 square yards, less than one
acre and a quarter, which would not have sufficed to accommodate
more than 500 men.<a id="FNanchor_2831" href="#Footnote_2831" class="fnanchor">2831</a> As for the ‘mottes’, they have been
excavated, and have been proved to be simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tumuli</i>, which
contained skeletons, flint implements, and bone pins. And the
Abbé Haigneré<a id="FNanchor_2832" href="#Footnote_2832" class="fnanchor">2832</a> has shown, in an amusing paragraph, that the
so-called camp of Labienus, which, needless to say, is not marked
on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Carte de l’État-Major</i>, is purely imaginary.</p>

<p>Every argument which has been adduced in favour of Wissant
has now been examined; and if I could have accepted them or
any one of them, I would gladly have done so, for I myself once
argued that the Portus Itius was at Wissant. But my knowledge
was then imperfect. It is not possible to prove that the Portus Itius
was at Wissant: it is possible to prove that it was not.</p>

<p>1. Although Wissant is nearer to England than Boulogne, yet
Caesar would have gained nothing, even in regard to his mere
voyage, by making Wissant his place of departure. Captain Iron,
the harbour-master of Dover, unhesitatingly affirmed, after we had
studied the chart together, that the fleet would have ‘made a better
run’ from Boulogne than from Wissant. The reader will have no
difficulty in understanding this if he will consult the Admiralty
Chart (<cite>Dungeness to the Thames</cite>), and the Atlas entitled <cite>Tidal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">580</span>
Streams in the English and Irish Channels</cite>. It must be remembered
that both in 55 and in 54 <small>B.C.</small> Caesar started from Gaul when the
tide was running down the Channel; and that on his first voyage
the tide turned north-eastward between 4.30 and 5 a.m., when
he had been three or four hours at sea, and on his second about
9.30 p.m., two hours or so after he had set sail. Thus, on each
occasion, the latter and greater portion of the voyage was made on
the flood tide.<a id="FNanchor_2833" href="#Footnote_2833" class="fnanchor">2833</a></p>

<p>Wauters does indeed succeed in proving that, in the middle
ages, Wissant was very frequently used as a place of embarkation
by travellers, merchants, and even troops sailing for the opposite
coast;<a id="FNanchor_2834" href="#Footnote_2834" class="fnanchor">2834</a> and the point of his argument is that if, in the middle ages,
a large army could embark at Wissant, Caesar’s army could have done
the same; and that if Wissant was a convenient point of departure
for a voyage to Britain in the middle ages, it was not less convenient
in the time of Caesar. Haigneré<a id="FNanchor_2835" href="#Footnote_2835" class="fnanchor">2835</a> retorts, truly enough, that the
quantity of merchandise which passed through the port at any one
time was very small, and that, as a rule, not more than two or three
vessels left the port simultaneously; but when he affirms<a id="FNanchor_2836" href="#Footnote_2836" class="fnanchor">2836</a> that the
largest army which ever sailed from Wissant was a force of 2,000
men, which John of Hainault led in 1327 to assist Edward the Third
against the Scots,<a id="FNanchor_2837" href="#Footnote_2837" class="fnanchor">2837</a> he lays himself open to criticism. Wauters<a id="FNanchor_2838" href="#Footnote_2838" class="fnanchor">2838</a>
replies that the force with which the Earl of Leicester sailed from
Wissant in 1173 must have been very large; for in the battle of
Fornham, in which the earl suffered defeat soon after he had landed
in Suffolk, 10,000 of his men were killed. This statement, which
was accepted by the late Bishop of Oxford,<a id="FNanchor_2839" href="#Footnote_2839" class="fnanchor">2839</a> was made on the
authority of Benedict of Peterborough,<a id="FNanchor_2840" href="#Footnote_2840" class="fnanchor">2840</a> who also describes the army
of the Earl of Leicester as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">infinitus exercitus</i>. But (if we are to
accept the statement of a mediaeval monk as to the number of
men who were killed in a battle) Benedict does not say that
<i>the army</i> set sail from Wissant, while Ralph de Diceto<a id="FNanchor_2841" href="#Footnote_2841" class="fnanchor">2841</a> merely says
that the Earl of Leicester embarked in a ship at Wissant, accompanied
by a numerous band (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">venit apud Witsant, ubi ... plurima
comitante caterva, navem ascendit</i>); and, assuming that the troops
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">581</span>
all embarked at Wissant, there is no evidence that all the transports
which carried them sailed together. It is generally admitted even by
the partisans of Wissant (though not by Dr. Guest) that the mediaeval
port was merely the creek formed by the Rieu d’Herlan, otherwise
called Rieu de Sombre; and if it is true that an army which lost
10,000 men in a single battle embarked at Wissant in 1173, the bulk
of the ships which carried it must have been anchored in the roadstead.
The frequency with which Wissant was used as a place of
embarkation in the middle ages undoubtedly proves that it was
convenient, and this fact has been slurred over by the advocates
of Boulogne; but it nevertheless remains certain that Caesar
would not have found it convenient to sail from Wissant when
<i>the greater part of his voyage would have to be made upon the eastward
stream, and with a south-west wind</i>. At the same time I admit that
we do not know from what quarter the wind was blowing in his
first voyage: we only know that when he set sail it was favourable.<a id="FNanchor_2842" href="#Footnote_2842" class="fnanchor">2842</a></p>

<p>2. There is another objection to Wissant, which Dr. Guest, if
he had been consistent, would have been the first to urge. Like
all the other advocates of Wissant, he identifies the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">superior portus</i>
with Sangatte. Yet he tells us himself that it is hard to see how
there could ever have been a harbour at Sangatte.<a id="FNanchor_2843" href="#Footnote_2843" class="fnanchor">2843</a> Similarly,
H. L. Long, himself an advocate of Wissant, who was well acquainted
with the coast between Boulogne and Calais, observes that ‘as a
port, in our acceptation of the term, Sangatte has fewer pretensions ... than
even Wissant; but still it is, and always has been a small
station’.<a id="FNanchor_2844" href="#Footnote_2844" class="fnanchor">2844</a> The theory that it was a naval station is no doubt
supported by the fact that it was the terminus of a Roman road:
but Caesar speaks of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">portus</i>; and when Dr. Guest has to confute
George Long, he is most emphatic in insisting that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">portus</i> means
‘a harbour’ in the strictest sense of the word.<a id="FNanchor_2845" href="#Footnote_2845" class="fnanchor">2845</a></p>

<p>Let us, however, assume that Sangatte may conceivably have
possessed a harbour in Caesar’s time. Even so, it is impossible
to admit that Sangatte can have been the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">superior portus</i>. For,
if the eighteen ships which carried the cavalry had started from
Sangatte, the conditions of wind and tide which would have rendered
a voyage from Wissant to Kent less favourable than from Boulogne
would obviously have been more unfavourable still.</p>

<p>3. There is one passage in Caesar’s narrative which, to a sailor,
would be alone sufficient to prove that Wissant was not the port
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">582</span>
from which Caesar sailed in 55 <small>B.C.</small> We have seen that the gale
which drove some of the cavalry transports from the point where they
were first sighted westward down the coast carried the others back
to the port from which they had started. I will assume that the
latter were laid to on the port tack:<a id="FNanchor_2846" href="#Footnote_2846" class="fnanchor">2846</a> if they could not work to
windward, a glance at the map will show that they could not have
returned to any point east of Wissant. The gale must obviously have
blown from some point between the east and the north; and, if Caesar
sailed from Wissant, the place from which the transports started
must, as we have seen, have been Sangatte. Now it is absolutely
incredible that a gale which drove some of these ships from a point
near the South Foreland<a id="FNanchor_2847" href="#Footnote_2847" class="fnanchor">2847</a> westward down the coast should have
carried the others back to Sangatte. Caesar says that the former
were ‘in great peril’, and that, when they anchored, the waves
broke over them. A sailor would at once understand what their
peril was. They were in no danger of being driven ashore; for
while the gale was at its height they stood out to sea.<a id="FNanchor_2848" href="#Footnote_2848" class="fnanchor">2848</a> They ran
before the wind; and they were in danger either of broaching
to or, possibly, of being ‘pooped’.<a id="FNanchor_2849" href="#Footnote_2849" class="fnanchor">2849</a> From this we should conclude
that the wind, when it struck the ships somewhere east or north-east
of the South Foreland,<a id="FNanchor_2850" href="#Footnote_2850" class="fnanchor">2850</a> blew from about the north-east: indeed,
as the waves broke over the ships, it may have blown from north-east
by east; for, if it had blown from the north-east or north-east
by north, the ships, if they anchored close in shore, west of Folkestone,
would have been in a sheltered position.<a id="FNanchor_2851" href="#Footnote_2851" class="fnanchor">2851</a> The most easterly point
at which they can be assumed to have been when they were caught
by the gale is NW. 4° N. of Sangatte. Therefore if the wind had
blown from the north-east, the ships that were carried back to the
port from which they had started would have had to sail within
less than eight points and a half of it in order to reach Sangatte.
But, as Falconer<a id="FNanchor_2852" href="#Footnote_2852" class="fnanchor">2852</a> says, a ship laid to in a gale makes from
5½ to 6½ points of lee-way. Reduce this estimate to four, and
you will see that the transports would have had to lie within less
than four points and a half of the wind in order to make Sangatte.
No ancient ship could have done this. Close-hauled and under
short canvas, as they would necessarily have been, the transports,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">583</span>
as Commander Richmond remarked to me, would ‘just have sagged
to leeward’. It may be objected that the tide would have helped
them if it was running up the Channel. But the flood tide is almost
neutralized by a north-easterly gale, and simply makes the sea
more vicious: the ships would have moved so slowly that they could
not have crossed the Channel in one tide; and when it turned and
began to sweep them westward, their prospect of reaching Sangatte
would have been more hopeless than ever. With a north-easterly gale,
or even one which blew from north-east by north, it would have been
absolutely impossible, so Commander Richmond and the harbour-master
of Dover have separately and independently affirmed, for
the vessels to fetch that anchorage.<a id="FNanchor_2853" href="#Footnote_2853" class="fnanchor">2853</a></p>

<p>4. Desjardins<a id="FNanchor_2854" href="#Footnote_2854" class="fnanchor">2854</a> shows that, whereas four Roman roads, meeting
at Gesoriacum, are mentioned in the itineraries,<a id="FNanchor_2855" href="#Footnote_2855" class="fnanchor">2855</a> not a single Roman
road led to Wissant. The advocates of Wissant have, indeed,
replied that this proves nothing, since, in Caesar’s time, there were
no Roman roads in any part of Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_2856" href="#Footnote_2856" class="fnanchor">2856</a> But this reply is nugatory.
Since no Roman roads led to Wissant, it is clear that if Wissant was
the Portus Itius, this harbour, which Caesar had ascertained to be
‘the most convenient’ port of departure for Britain, was regarded
by his successors as useless. Such a hypothesis is not tenable.</p>

<p>5. The mention of roads suggests another objection to Wissant.
We have seen that Caesar’s army, consisting of five legions and
2,000 cavalry, remained weatherbound at the Portus Itius in 54 <small>B.C.</small>
for about twenty-five days; and that with them were three other
legions and 2,000 cavalry, who were left behind under the command
of Labienus to guard the ports during Caesar’s absence.<a id="FNanchor_2857" href="#Footnote_2857" class="fnanchor">2857</a> Thus for
twenty-five days a force amounting to at least 32,000 men and
4,000 horses had to be fed; and of these not less than 12,500 men
and 2,000 horses for about ten weeks more.<a id="FNanchor_2858" href="#Footnote_2858" class="fnanchor">2858</a> No calculation is needed
to show that these multitudes could not possibly have been supplied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">584</span>
by the country in the neighbourhood of Wissant, even if it were as
fertile as (according to Dr. Guest himself) it is ‘notoriously barren’.<a id="FNanchor_2859" href="#Footnote_2859" class="fnanchor">2859</a>
Their food must have come from a distance; and to transport it
to Wissant without roads would have been a task of extreme difficulty.
Dr. Guest assumes that Caesar’s fleet would have supplied
his wants.<a id="FNanchor_2860" href="#Footnote_2860" class="fnanchor">2860</a> But the fleet could only have procured grain from a
port. Surely, then, Caesar would have found it most convenient
to start from a port which was in communication by road or by
river with the interior. Such a port was Boulogne, which enjoyed
both these means of transit. What would have been gained by
abandoning it for the isolated Wissant?</p>

<p>Again, it will be remembered that Labienus built sixty ships
during Caesar’s absence in Britain;<a id="FNanchor_2861" href="#Footnote_2861" class="fnanchor">2861</a> and we have seen that most of
the modern advocates of Wissant admit that there was no harbour
there, except the tiny creek formed by the ruisseau d’Herlan, or
possibly a roadstead which may have been partially sheltered by
the Banc de Laine. Not one of them has attempted to explain how
Labienus could have found the means of building sixty ships upon
an exposed beach. But let us admit that his genius could have
improvised dockyards.<a id="FNanchor_2862" href="#Footnote_2862" class="fnanchor">2862</a> Let us even admit that the harbour of
Dr. Guest’s imagination did really exist. Still, sixty ships cannot
be built without timber. How was all this timber to be brought to
Wissant without roads and without a river? Even assuming that
there was a Gallic road, it is doubtful whether Labienus could have
impressed the amount of carriage necessary to transport the timber
from the forests. But a few miles off at Boulogne the difficulty
would have disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_2863" href="#Footnote_2863" class="fnanchor">2863</a></p>

<p>6. Another objection is so obvious that it must impress every
candid inquirer. If Wissant was the Portus Itius, why was Wissant
never once mentioned during the first millennium of our era? There
is no evidence worthy of the name that it was used as a port before
the year 1013.<a id="FNanchor_2864" href="#Footnote_2864" class="fnanchor">2864</a> It is surely inexplicable that the port which Caesar
regarded as the most convenient for his purpose should have been
found so inconvenient or so superfluous by his successors that during
the imperial epoch it fell into entire disuse. Wauters indeed
retorts that if Wissant was eclipsed by Gesoriacum under the Empire,
so was the Gallic town of Bibracte by the Gallo-Roman Augustodunum,
and that, although the naval station was Gesoriacum,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">585</span>
Wissant <i>may</i> have been a great commercial port.<a id="FNanchor_2865" href="#Footnote_2865" class="fnanchor">2865</a> But he omits
to explain how a great commercial port could have been left unnoticed
by history, or how it could have existed without a river
and roads to connect it with the interior. Nor is there any analogy
between Wissant and Bibracte. The hill-fort of Bibracte gradually
fell into disuse because when Gaul settled down under the Roman
dominion it was no longer required.<a id="FNanchor_2866" href="#Footnote_2866" class="fnanchor">2866</a></p>

<p>7. Finally, Mariette<a id="FNanchor_2867" href="#Footnote_2867" class="fnanchor">2867</a> argues that the mere name of Wissant,
which, like the names of many other villages in the Boulonnais,
is of German origin, proves that it was not founded before the fifth
century, and consequently that there could have been no frequented
harbour there in Caesar’s time.</p>

<p>It has now been demonstrated that Caesar did not sail from Wissant.
That it was the point of departure of his first expedition is out of
the question; for in that case the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">portus ulterior</i>, from which the
cavalry transports set sail, must have been Sangatte; and we have
seen that they could not have returned to Sangatte when they were
dispersed by the gale. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">portus ulterior</i> can only have been
Ambleteuse; and therefore Caesar sailed in 55 <small>B.C.</small> from Boulogne.
But nobody will believe that, having had experience of the advantages
of Boulogne, he would have discarded it in favour of a place which,
for his purpose, was in all respects inferior.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, to satisfy doubters, I shall state the case for and
against Boulogne.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg585">IX. BOULOGNE</h3>

<p>The reasons which point to the identification of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Portus Itius</i>
with Boulogne are, speaking generally, that Boulogne, and Boulogne
only, satisfies all the requirements of Caesar’s narrative.</p>

<p>To begin with, the passage for sailing-vessels from Boulogne to
the south-eastern part of Britain is, and always has been, in circumstances
such as Caesar described, not only very convenient but
by far the most convenient. This is the testimony of seafaring
men, both English and French, who have practical experience of the
winds and the currents in the Channel: it was admitted, or rather
strenuously maintained, by Henry,<a id="FNanchor_2868" href="#Footnote_2868" class="fnanchor">2868</a> who advocated the claims of
Wissant; and any man who studies the Admiralty Chart&mdash;<cite>Dungeness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">586</span>
to the Thames</cite>&mdash;the <cite>Channel Pilot</cite>, and the Atlas, published by the
Admiralty, which is entitled <cite>Tidal Streams in the English and Irish
Channels</cite>, may convince himself of its truth. Captain Pollet, the
harbour-master of Calais and Boulogne, furnished information to
Ernest de Saulcy, who was determined, by hook or by crook, to make
out a plausible case in support of Wissant; but he avowed his own
opinion that Caesar must have sailed from Boulogne.<a id="FNanchor_2869" href="#Footnote_2869" class="fnanchor">2869</a> Captain
Iron, the harbour-master of Dover, in conversation with me, has
done the same.</p>

<p>Secondly, the whole of Caesar’s fleet could easily have assembled
in the port of Boulogne; and they certainly could not have assembled
in any other port, properly so-called, on the coast of the Morini,<a id="FNanchor_2870" href="#Footnote_2870" class="fnanchor">2870</a>
except the mouth of the Canche, which was several miles further
from Britain than Boulogne, and was in no respect more convenient.
Desjardins<a id="FNanchor_2871" href="#Footnote_2871" class="fnanchor">2871</a> has shown that the estuary of the Liane was much
broader and deeper in Caesar’s time than it was in the nineteenth
century before the harbour was modernized, and that, as the
headland which sheltered it has suffered greatly from erosion, it
extended further seaward; and not only was it ample in extent,
but it was the only port protected from every wind.<a id="FNanchor_2872" href="#Footnote_2872" class="fnanchor">2872</a> No one has
described its merits more eloquently than Henry, the advocate
of Wissant; and no one was more competent to form an opinion.
He describes Gesoriacum as ‘le havre le plus commode et le mieux
situé de toute la Gaule-Belgique, pour le commerce, la construction
et l’équipement des vaisseaux’.<a id="FNanchor_2873" href="#Footnote_2873" class="fnanchor">2873</a> But, although it is certain that
there would have been ample room in the Liane for Caesar’s 800
small vessels,<a id="FNanchor_2874" href="#Footnote_2874" class="fnanchor">2874</a> Airy insists that it would have been impossible for
them to clear the harbour in a single tide.<a id="FNanchor_2875" href="#Footnote_2875" class="fnanchor">2875</a> Now Caesar does not
say that they did clear the harbour in a single tide; nor is it necessary
to assume that they did. Captain Iron has, however, assured me
that Caesar’s fleet of shallow vessels could have cleared the harbour
in a single tide even if the depth of the water then had been no
greater than in 1877. In that year the depth <i>at low tide</i> was
1 metre 60, or more than 5 feet<a id="FNanchor_2876" href="#Footnote_2876" class="fnanchor">2876</a>; and it may be regarded as certain
that the draught of Caesar’s vessels in the second expedition was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">587</span>
much less than five feet.<a id="FNanchor_2877" href="#Footnote_2877" class="fnanchor">2877</a> The estuary of the Liane has been silted
up so much since Caesar’s time that it would hardly be an exaggeration
to say that its depth then was three times as much as in 1877;<a id="FNanchor_2878" href="#Footnote_2878" class="fnanchor">2878</a>
and it has been ascertained from the sinking of artesian wells at the
cement works of M. Demarle at Capécure<a id="FNanchor_2879" href="#Footnote_2879" class="fnanchor">2879</a> that at that place the
ancient bed of the river is 19 metres below the level of spring tides.<a id="FNanchor_2880" href="#Footnote_2880" class="fnanchor">2880</a></p>

<p>Thirdly, the distance of Ambleteuse from Boulogne corresponds
closely enough with Caesar’s estimate of the distance of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior
portus</i> from the Portus Itius. This does not prove the identity of
the Portus Itius with Boulogne: but, if it is not a fact, the Portus
Itius was not Boulogne; and it is therefore necessary to examine
the arguments of those who have denied it. ‘On measuring,’ says
Airy,<a id="FNanchor_2881" href="#Footnote_2881" class="fnanchor">2881</a> ‘upon the beautiful Admiralty Chart the distance between
the centre of the entrance to Boulogne and the centre of the entrance
to Ambleteuse, I find it to be not quite 4½ nautical miles, or 5½
Roman miles; instead of the 8 miles given by Caesar.’ This
estimate is accurate; but it is also irrelevant; for Airy measures
the distance by sea; and Caesar must have meant the distance by
land. ‘It was quite immaterial,’ says Lewin,<a id="FNanchor_2882" href="#Footnote_2882" class="fnanchor">2882</a> ‘what was the distance
by sea, for the eighteen transports were windbound, and
could not reach him; but, as he could not dispense with the vessels,
he had to consider what portion of his force could be most conveniently
despatched thither, and as the transports lay eight miles
off, he thought it best, in order to save time, to send thither his
cavalry ... by the nearest road from the port of Boulogne, through
Wimille and Slacq to the church at Ambleteuse, the distance is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">588</span>
twelve kilometres.’<a id="FNanchor_2883" href="#Footnote_2883" class="fnanchor">2883</a> It is amusing to find that Airy, who lays
so much stress upon the accuracy of Caesar’s (assumed) estimate
of the distance by sea from the Portus Itius to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i>,
maintains on the preceding page (<cite>Essays on the Invasion of Britain</cite>, &amp;c.,
p. 27) that Caesar’s estimates of distances by sea were valueless.</p>

<p>Fourthly, Caesar’s narrative of the adventures of his cavalry
transports is easily comprehensible on the hypothesis that the port
from which he himself sailed was Boulogne, but on no other.<a id="FNanchor_2884" href="#Footnote_2884" class="fnanchor">2884</a> As
we have seen, the storm of the 30th of August, 55 <small>B.C.</small>, which prevented
them from making the Kentish coast near Caesar’s camp,
drove some of them westward to a point on the south coast, and
carried the rest back to the point whence they had started, namely,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i>. That port, if Caesar sailed from Boulogne, was
Ambleteuse; and there is no difficulty in believing, nor has it ever
been denied, that the wind, before which some of the ships ran from
the neighbourhood of the South Foreland<a id="FNanchor_2885" href="#Footnote_2885" class="fnanchor">2885</a> in the direction of
Dungeness, would have carried the others, which were laid to,
back to Ambleteuse.</p>

<p>Fifthly, Caesar, as we have seen, sailed from the Portus Itius
with a south-westerly wind;<a id="FNanchor_2886" href="#Footnote_2886" class="fnanchor">2886</a> and it is needless to tell any one who
will consult the map that to sail with a south-westerly wind, especially
with flat-bottomed vessels which made a great deal of lee-way, and
on the easterly going stream, from Boulogne either to Sandwich,
Deal, Walmer, Hythe, or Lympne, would have been easier than to
sail from Wissant.</p>

<p>Sixthly, it is universally admitted that Boulogne, which Pliny<a id="FNanchor_2887" href="#Footnote_2887" class="fnanchor">2887</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">589</span>
calls the <i>portus Morinorum Britannicus</i>, was the permanent naval
station of the Romans in the imperial epoch, and that it was the harbour
from which they habitually sailed for the coast of Kent.<a id="FNanchor_2888" href="#Footnote_2888" class="fnanchor">2888</a> An
inscription preserved in the Boulogne museum<a id="FNanchor_2889" href="#Footnote_2889" class="fnanchor">2889</a> proves that this
station was established at least as early as the reign of Claudius,
while Suetonius<a id="FNanchor_2890" href="#Footnote_2890" class="fnanchor">2890</a> tells us that Claudius embarked at Gesoriacum for
Britain. Indeed there is indirect evidence that the station existed
in the time of Augustus; for the road which ran from Mediolanum
(Milan) past Lugdunum (Lyons), Durocortorum (Reims), and
Ambiani (Amiens), to Gesoriacum<a id="FNanchor_2891" href="#Footnote_2891" class="fnanchor">2891</a> was constructed by Agrippa.
It has been argued that, although Gesoriacum was the recognized
harbour from the time of Augustus, the fact does not prove that
it was the harbour from which Caesar sailed. But to those who
admit that it has been proved that no other port existed which
would have served Caesar’s purpose the fact will appear conclusive.<a id="FNanchor_2892" href="#Footnote_2892" class="fnanchor">2892</a></p>

<p>Seventhly, Desjardins<a id="FNanchor_2893" href="#Footnote_2893" class="fnanchor">2893</a> has pointed out that Gallic ports were
always either in the mouths of rivers or otherwise sheltered from
storms. Such a port was Gesoriacum; and if Wissant was a Gallic
harbour at all, it was a solitary exception to the rule.</p>

<p>Lastly, Rudolf Schneider<a id="FNanchor_2894" href="#Footnote_2894" class="fnanchor">2894</a> lays great stress upon the fact that,
according to Pomponius Mela,<a id="FNanchor_2895" href="#Footnote_2895" class="fnanchor">2895</a> no harbour on the northern coast of
Gaul was better known than Gesoriacum; and he reminds us that
Pliny<a id="FNanchor_2896" href="#Footnote_2896" class="fnanchor">2896</a> mentioned no other harbour in the country of the Morini.
Unless, he argues, the Portus Itius was identical with Gesoriacum,
Mela, Pliny, and the later writers must have forgotten its existence.
Now nothing would be easier than to make a dialectical reply to
this argument,&mdash;Is it not equally remarkable that none of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">590</span>
writers even hints that Gesoriacum was the Portus Itius? This
was the reply which I made myself on another occasion. But the
reply was sophistical. Schneider’s argument depends upon the
assumption that the Portus Itius was one of the great harbours of
Gaul; and considering that it could accommodate 800 vessels,
this assumption is certainly reasonable. At all events it is impossible
to suggest any other explanation of the fact that after Strabo no
writer mentioned the Portus Itius for more than a thousand years,
except this,&mdash;that the Portus Itius and Gesoriacum were one.</p>

<p>It would be waste of time to repeat the arguments, which have
already been stated by implication in the section on Wissant, based
upon the unique advantages that Boulogne possessed in being
connected with the interior by river and road.<a id="FNanchor_2897" href="#Footnote_2897" class="fnanchor">2897</a></p>

<p>It remains only to consider the objections which have been made
to the identification of the Portus Itius with Boulogne.</p>

<p>1. The very fact that Boulogne was called Gesoriacum is regarded
by Long<a id="FNanchor_2898" href="#Footnote_2898" class="fnanchor">2898</a> as presumptive evidence that it was not called Portus
Itius.</p>

<p>Desjardins,<a id="FNanchor_2899" href="#Footnote_2899" class="fnanchor">2899</a> who evidently regards this as a serious objection,
has taken great pains to remove it. He argues that the Portus
Itius was not exactly the same as the imperial harbour of Gesoriacum,
but that it comprised that part of the estuary of the Liane which
lies between Bréquerecque and Isques; and, he triumphantly
remarks, the name ‘Isques’ is derived from <i>Itius</i>. But ‘Isques’
cannot have been derived from <i>Itius</i>: the names ‘Ausques’,‘Quesques’,
‘Clerques’, ‘Setques’, and ‘Wisques’ are derived from
<i>Alciacum</i>, <i>Kessiacum</i>, <i>Quertliacum</i>, <i>Sethiacum</i>, and <i>Wiciacum</i>; and
the inference is that not <i>Itius</i> but <i>Isiacum</i> would have been transformed
into ‘Isques’.<a id="FNanchor_2900" href="#Footnote_2900" class="fnanchor">2900</a> Rudolf Schneider,<a id="FNanchor_2901" href="#Footnote_2901" class="fnanchor">2901</a> who is too honest and too
hard-headed to be deluded by Desjardins’s attempt to draw a distinction
between Gesoriacum and Portus Itius, frankly admits that
the unrecorded change of name has not been explained. But is
there anything to explain? ‘Portus Itius’ is not, properly speaking,
a name at all: it does not designate a town; it means simply
‘the Itian harbour’. Long saw nothing inexplicable in the fact
that Gesoriacum was called by Pliny <i>portus</i> [Morinorum] <i>Britannicus</i>:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">591</span>
why, then, should he have found it impossible to believe that its
harbour was called by Caesar <i>portus Itius</i>?<a id="FNanchor_2902" href="#Footnote_2902" class="fnanchor">2902</a> Was not the port of
Athens called the Piraeus?</p>

<p>2. Long, after making the amazing remark that ‘such a port as
Boulogne would have been quite useless in Caesar’s second expedition’,
says that ‘the Romans estimated the distance from Boulogne
to the British coast at fifty Roman miles; but this is too
much.... However, they were right in making the distance more than
the distance from Itius to the nearest point of the British coast; and
the conclusion is that Gesoriacum and Itius were different places.’<a id="FNanchor_2903" href="#Footnote_2903" class="fnanchor">2903</a></p>

<p>The conclusion is simply that, assuming the identity of Gesoriacum
with the Portus Itius, Caesar’s estimate of the distance from Gesoriacum
to Britain was different from that of later writers. Besides,
the only one of ‘the Romans’, as far as we know, who ‘estimated
the distance from Boulogne to the British coast at fifty Roman
miles’ was Pliny;<a id="FNanchor_2904" href="#Footnote_2904" class="fnanchor">2904</a> and it may be presumed that by ‘the British
coast’ he meant Rutupiae, or Richborough, which was a port,
if not the chief port, of arrival in his day. For he estimated the
shortest passage at fifty Roman miles: according to Dion Cassius,<a id="FNanchor_2905" href="#Footnote_2905" class="fnanchor">2905</a>
the shortest passage was 450 stades; and this, according to the
<i>Itinerary</i> of Antonine,<a id="FNanchor_2906" href="#Footnote_2906" class="fnanchor">2906</a> was precisely the length of the passage from
Boulogne to Richborough.</p>

<p>Long goes on to say that in the <i>Itinerary</i> of Antonine the distance
from Boulogne to Richborough ‘was estimated at 450 stadia;
and, if we follow d’Anville in estimating this maritime stadium
at ten to the Roman mile, the distance is fairly given. So if we
take the 320 stadia which Strabo gives as the length of Caesar’s
voyages, we have thirty-two Roman miles; or, if we take the
reading which Eustathius, copying Strabo, has in his commentary
on Dionysius, 300 stadia, we have exactly thirty Roman miles,
as in Caesar’s text. The conclusion is that, in addition to the fact
of Boulogne (Gesoriacum) and Ouissant (Itius) having different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">592</span>
names, the ancient authorities place them at different distances
from the British coast.’<a id="FNanchor_2907" href="#Footnote_2907" class="fnanchor">2907</a></p>

<p>Again Long’s conclusion is at fault. To begin with, Strabo
did not estimate the maritime stadium at ten, but at eight to the
Roman mile.<a id="FNanchor_2908" href="#Footnote_2908" class="fnanchor">2908</a> Assuming, however, that he did estimate it at
one-tenth of a Roman mile, there is no reason to suppose that when
Caesar estimated the distance from the Portus Itius to Britain, he
meant the distance to Richborough; and the only conclusion that
can be drawn from Long’s data is that ‘the ancient authorities’
reckoned the length of Caesar’s voyage less than the distance between
Richborough and Boulogne. And when Long says that the estimated
distance, 450 stadia, from Boulogne to Richborough ‘is fairly given’,
it is amusing to find him admitting that Caesar’s estimate of 30
miles ‘exceeds the distance from Wissant to the nearest part of the
English coast, and it is about the true distance from Boulogne to
the same part of the English coast’. Thus, on Long’s own showing,
Caesar’s estimate of the distance from the Portus Itius to the British
coast corresponds with the actual distance from Boulogne to the
same, and the estimate of the <cite>Itinerary</cite> is equally true. The reader
who has followed him so far will hardly be surprised by his remark,
that ‘even a real good harbour would have been useless to Caesar’.<a id="FNanchor_2909" href="#Footnote_2909" class="fnanchor">2909</a></p>

<p>3. Heller,<a id="FNanchor_2910" href="#Footnote_2910" class="fnanchor">2910</a> after quoting the statement of Pliny as to the length
of the shortest passage from Boulogne to Britain, and the statement
of the <cite>Itinerary</cite> of Antonine as to the distance from Boulogne
to Richborough, argues (<i>a</i>) that, as they overestimated the distance
from Gaul to Britain, Caesar probably did the same; (<i>b</i>) that if
Pliny had identified Boulogne with the Portus Itius, he would not
have estimated the distance of Boulogne from the nearest point of
Britain at 50 miles, but would have followed Caesar and written
‘about 30’; (<i>c</i>) that if Caesar had started from Boulogne, he would,
according to the usual tendency of the ancients, have overestimated
the distance from Boulogne to Britain, and would therefore have
reckoned it at considerably more than ‘about 30 miles’, seeing
that the actual distance from Boulogne to Dover is 33.</p>

<p>The first of these arguments, if it had come from a tiro, might
have been passed over with a smile; but one would hardly have
expected it from Heller. The third is based upon a misleading
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_593">593</span>
statement;<a id="FNanchor_2911" href="#Footnote_2911" class="fnanchor">2911</a> and even if we could be sure that Caesar overestimated
the length of his voyage, it would be inconclusive, for, as we have
seen,<a id="FNanchor_2912" href="#Footnote_2912" class="fnanchor">2912</a> it is not improbable that he estimated it at 40 Roman miles.
And as for Pliny, ‘the shortest passage,’ which he estimated at
50 miles, was probably, I repeat, the passage from Boulogne to
Richborough.</p>

<p>4. H. L. Long,<a id="FNanchor_2913" href="#Footnote_2913" class="fnanchor">2913</a> if I do not misunderstand him, argues that there
could have been no port at Ambleteuse in the days of Caesar. Speaking
of ‘the immense irruption of blown sand’, he maintains that
‘this dune ... acts as a dam to the drainage of the valley; an
interruption which must have produced swamps in former days,
and is now but imperfectly corrected by an artificial channel, the
embouchure of which forms the little harbour of Ambleteuse’.</p>

<p>This argument obviously depends upon the untenable assumption
that the sand-dune existed in Caesar’s time; and it is shaken by
the fact that Roman antiquities have been discovered at Ambleteuse.<a id="FNanchor_2914" href="#Footnote_2914" class="fnanchor">2914</a>
Moreover, according to the writer of the article <cite>Ambleteuse</cite> in M.
Vivien de Saint-Martin’s <cite>Nouveau Dictionnaire de Géographie Universelle</cite>
(i, 1879, p. 115), Ambleteuse, under the rule of the English,
had an excellent harbour,<a id="FNanchor_2915" href="#Footnote_2915" class="fnanchor">2915</a> and was not choked up by the accumulation
of sand until after 1549.<a id="FNanchor_2916" href="#Footnote_2916" class="fnanchor">2916</a></p>

<p>5. General Creuly,<a id="FNanchor_2917" href="#Footnote_2917" class="fnanchor">2917</a> referring to the attack made by 6,000 of the
Morini upon the Roman soldiers who disembarked from the two
ships which failed to make the harbours in 55 <small>B.C.</small> and were carried
‘a little further down’, insists that Caesar’s account of this episode<a id="FNanchor_2918" href="#Footnote_2918" class="fnanchor">2918</a>
is incompatible with the view that the Portus Itius was Boulogne.
For, he argues, the 6,000 Morini could not have belonged to the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pagus Gesoriacus</i>, that is to say, the district of Boulogne, since the
inhabitants of this region had submitted to Caesar, and, moreover,
it was so sparsely populated that 6,000 men could not have assembled
on the spur of the moment. He also reminds us that on the day
following the attack Labienus marched against the rebellious Morini,
and soon subdued them, as, owing to a drought, they were unable
to take refuge in the marshes which had served them as an asylum
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_594">594</span>
in the preceding year;<a id="FNanchor_2919" href="#Footnote_2919" class="fnanchor">2919</a> and he denies that there were any marshes
in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pagus Gesoriacus</i> large enough to serve such a purpose.</p>

<p>Creuly can only make a show of sustaining these objections by
resorting to Airy’s fantastic theory,<a id="FNanchor_2920" href="#Footnote_2920" class="fnanchor">2920</a>&mdash;that Caesar, when he said that
two of his ships were carried ‘a little further down’, meant not
‘down the coast’ but ‘in the direction of the wind’. If the inhabitants
of the district of Boulogne had submitted, why should
they not have rebelled? The Aduatuci submitted and afterwards
rebelled:<a id="FNanchor_2921" href="#Footnote_2921" class="fnanchor">2921</a> the Nervii submitted and afterwards rebelled;<a id="FNanchor_2922" href="#Footnote_2922" class="fnanchor">2922</a> the Britons
submitted and afterwards rebelled:<a id="FNanchor_2923" href="#Footnote_2923" class="fnanchor">2923</a>&mdash;but it is needless to multiply
examples. For Caesar expressly states that the Morini who attacked
his soldiers <i>had</i> submitted to him before he sailed for Britain.<a id="FNanchor_2924" href="#Footnote_2924" class="fnanchor">2924</a>
I am not concerned to defend the accuracy of his statement, that
their number was 6,000: but Creuly admits that 6,000 Morini did
assemble somewhere in their own country; and how can he prove
that the district of Boulogne was more sparsely populated than any
other? As to the marshes, there is no evidence that they were in
the immediate neighbourhood of the spot where the soldiers were
attacked; but if they were, what is there to prevent us from identifying
them with the marshes south of Boulogne, between Camiers and
Dannes?<a id="FNanchor_2925" href="#Footnote_2925" class="fnanchor">2925</a></p>

<p>6. Heller’s objection,<a id="FNanchor_2926" href="#Footnote_2926" class="fnanchor">2926</a> that if Caesar had sailed from Boulogne
in 54 <small>B.C.</small> it would have been impossible for his ship to drift so far
by daybreak on the following morning as to justify him in saying
that he ‘saw Britain lying behind on the port quarter’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub sinistra
Britanniam relictam conspexit</i><a id="FNanchor_2927" href="#Footnote_2927" class="fnanchor">2927</a>), has been already answered.</p>

<p>7. Caesar, describing his return to Gaul in 54 <small>B.C.</small>, says that
‘at daybreak he reached land’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima luce terram attigit</i>), and that
his ‘ships were hauled up on the shore’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subductis navibus</i><a id="FNanchor_2928" href="#Footnote_2928" class="fnanchor">2928</a>). It has
been argued that ‘both of these expressions point to the conclusion
that he did not enter the mouth of a river’, and that ‘if the Portus
Itius was in the estuary of the Liane, to haul up the ships over the
banks on to the meadows would surely have been a difficult operation’.<a id="FNanchor_2929" href="#Footnote_2929" class="fnanchor">2929</a>
The author of this argument forgot that the ships need not have been
hauled up on to the meadows at all unless they had gone far up
the river, and that they may have been docked. But an expert
whom he has since consulted assures him that, even if it had been
necessary to haul up the ships over the banks on to the meadows,
the operation would have involved no serious difficulty.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_595">595</span></p>

<p>If this inquiry had merely established the probability of the
identification of the Portus Itius with the harbour of Boulogne, it
would not be possible to justify the labour which has been expended
upon it except on the ground that it will save those who may wish
to inform themselves a vast amount of research, and provide them
with complete equipment for arriving at an independent conclusion.
But that conclusion, if it is reached conscientiously by an unbiassed
mind, can only be one.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="PII_Pg595a">THE PLACE OF CAESAR’S LANDING
IN BRITAIN</h2>

<h3 id="PII_Pg595b">I. INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>After I had completed the researches which I undertook for
the purpose of writing this article, I saw that if an able soldier, or
even an intelligent civilian, who had a sufficient knowledge of ancient
warfare, were to ask himself where Caesar landed in Britain, he
could solve the problem after a brief inspection of the Ordnance
Map. He would perceive that there was only one part of the
Kentish coast on which Caesar could have expected to land, in
the face of an enemy, and then to march into the interior, without
incurring unnecessary loss. If he were told that a study of the
tides had proved that Caesar must have landed elsewhere, he would
reply, ‘There must be something wrong in your calculations. Perhaps
you have neglected to allow for the influence which strong
winds and other causes exert upon the tidal currents. Perhaps
you have misinterpreted or unduly strained certain parts of Caesar’s
narrative. It is even possible that Caesar himself may, from lapse
of memory, have mis-stated the day on which he first landed. Any
one of these suppositions is credible: but it is incredible that the
experienced officer whom he sent to reconnoitre the British coast
should have advised him to land below a range of hills when open
country was more easily accessible; still more that he should have
accepted the advice. It is absolutely certain that Caesar did not
commit an act of folly which any general who knew his business
would have avoided.’</p>

<p>But such a summary mode of treating the question would not
convince the scholars who must be convinced before it can be set
at rest; and the conclusion at which they have arrived is that it
is insoluble. So said Mommsen:<a id="FNanchor_2930" href="#Footnote_2930" class="fnanchor">2930</a> so say Mr. Warde Fowler,<a id="FNanchor_2931" href="#Footnote_2931" class="fnanchor">2931</a>
Mr. Tozer,<a id="FNanchor_2932" href="#Footnote_2932" class="fnanchor">2932</a> and, apparently, Dr. Hodgkin;<a id="FNanchor_2933" href="#Footnote_2933" class="fnanchor">2933</a> so said the late eminent
geographer, H. Kiepert, according to whom the numerous attempts
which have been made to determine Caesar’s landing-place ‘have,
because of the vagueness of many expressions of the principal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">596</span>
source [the <cite>Commentaries</cite> of Caesar], not attained more than a
hypothetical value, even after three centuries of learned quarrels’.<a id="FNanchor_2934" href="#Footnote_2934" class="fnanchor">2934</a>
Not because of the vagueness of Caesar’s expressions, but because
those who have commented upon them have not taken the trouble
to inform themselves. The indications which Caesar gives are
sufficient to enable any attentive reader to determine the place
where he landed with such certainty that every doubt shall be
removed,&mdash;if he knows how to use them; if, that is to say, he possesses
sufficient collateral knowledge to enable him to understand
what he reads. It is not enough to be a Latin scholar. It is necessary
also to study the ancient geography of the coast of Kent; to be
acquainted with the tidal phenomena of the English Channel; to
have at least an elementary knowledge of seamanship; to know
Caesar’s writings intimately, and not merely read the Fourth and
Fifth Books for the occasion; and, above all, to gain that understanding
of the principles of ancient warfare which can only be
acquired by one who has studied the history of modern campaigns,
and has learned, by experience or from intercourse with practical
men, how things actually happen. No genius is needed; only
industry, backed by common sense and by some intelligence and
acumen; but such industry as may, perhaps, be thought disproportionate
with the object. Not even Mommsen, with his colossal
power of work, could spare the necessary time.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg596">II. THE DATA FURNISHED BY CAESAR AND
OTHER ANCIENT WRITERS</h3>

<p>The data which we find in the <cite>Commentaries</cite> are the following.
Before starting on his first voyage, Caesar sent a military tribune,
named Volusenus, whom he believed to possess the necessary qualifications,
in a ship of war, to make a thorough reconnaissance of
the British coast, and to ascertain what harbours were capable of
accommodating a large flotilla.<a id="FNanchor_2935" href="#Footnote_2935" class="fnanchor">2935</a> Volusenus returned to Gaul four
days after his departure, having made all the observations that it
was possible for him to make without landing; for he had not
ventured to put himself in the power of the natives. Caesar himself
marched his army into the country of the Morini, as the shortest
passage to Britain was from their coast. The fleet which he ordered
to assemble consisted of about 100 country-built merchant vessels,
collected from the neighbouring districts, as well as some ships of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_597">597</span>
war and small fast-sailing vessels, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">speculatoria navigia</i>, or
‘scouts’. His intention had been made known in Britain by traders;
and while his ships were assembling, envoys sent by several British
tribes presented themselves before him, and promised to give him
hostages, and to submit to the Roman People. On their return
they were accompanied by Commius, a Gallic chieftain, who acted
as Caesar’s political agent and who took with him about thirty of
his own horsemen. Of the merchant vessels eighteen had assembled
in a harbour 8 Roman miles ‘beyond’ that which sheltered the
rest of the fleet,<a id="FNanchor_2936" href="#Footnote_2936" class="fnanchor">2936</a> and were prevented by contrary winds from joining
them. Caesar set sail ‘about the third watch’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tertia fere vigilia</i>)
in favourable weather, having ordered the cavalry to march to the
‘further’ port, embark there on the eighteen transports, and follow
him. Their movements, however, were somewhat dilatory. ‘About
the fourth hour’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hora circiter diei quarta</i>) the leading division of
the fleet had approached so close to the British coast that Caesar
could see an armed force of the enemy drawn up ‘on all the heights’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in omnibus collibus</i>). ‘The formation of the ground,’ he says,
‘was peculiar, the sea being so closely walled in by precipitous
heights that it was possible to throw a missile from the ground above
on to the shore.’<a id="FNanchor_2937" href="#Footnote_2937" class="fnanchor">2937</a> Regarding the place as unsuitable for landing,
he waited at anchor ‘till the ninth hour’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad horam nonam</i>) for the
arrival of the rest of the fleet. Meanwhile he assembled his generals
and military tribunes, communicated to them the report which he
had received from Volusenus, and gave them all necessary instructions.
They returned to their respective vessels; and, ‘getting
wind and tide simultaneously in his favour,’ Caesar weighed anchor,
sailed on (<i>progressus</i>) about 7 Roman miles, and ran the ships aground
‘on an open and evenly shelving shore’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aperto ac plano litore</i>).<a id="FNanchor_2938" href="#Footnote_2938" class="fnanchor">2938</a></p>

<p>The natives, divining his intention, had sent on ahead their
cavalry and charioteers, who were followed by the rest of the forces.
The important points in Caesar’s description of the disembarkation
are as follows:&mdash;some of the enemy, in opposing it, threw missiles
from the shore; others advanced a little way into the water, riding
or driving their horses. The transports, on account of their relatively
considerable draught, had necessarily grounded in deep
water; and on this account the Roman soldiers hesitated before
jumping into the sea to wade ashore. During the conflict Caesar
made some of his war-galleys sheer off a little from the transports,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">598</span>
and take up a position on the enemy’s exposed flank; and later on,
when legionaries who had just dropped into the sea and gathered
in small groups were being hard pressed, he manned the small
fast-sailing craft and the small boats belonging to the galleys, and
sent them to the rescue. The enemy derived an advantage from
their knowledge of the places where the water was shallow. Caesar
concludes his description of the landing by saying that it was impossible
to pursue the enemy far, because ‘the cavalry had not been
able to keep their course and make the island’.</p>

<p>On the fourth day after the landing (the day of the landing being
doubtless reckoned as the first day)<a id="FNanchor_2939" href="#Footnote_2939" class="fnanchor">2939</a> the eighteen transports that
carried the cavalry again set sail from the ‘further’ harbour with
a light wind. They were approaching the British coast and were
visible from Caesar’s camp, when a sudden storm came on with
the result that some of them were carried back to the harbour
whence they had started, while the others ‘were driven down in
great peril to the lower and more westerly part of the island’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
inferiorem partem insulae, quae est propius solis occasum, magno suo
cum periculo deicerentur</i>). They anchored: but the waves broke
over them; and they were obliged to stand out to sea in the face
of night<a id="FNanchor_2940" href="#Footnote_2940" class="fnanchor">2940</a> and make for the Continent.</p>

<p>On the same night there was a full moon; and Caesar remarks
that full moon causes extraordinarily high tides in the ocean. Owing
to the high tide and the gale, the ships of war, which had been
drawn up on the shore, were waterlogged, and many of the transports,
which were riding at anchor, were driven ashore and wrecked.
A few days later one of the legions was sent out in the ordinary
course to cut corn. Presently Caesar was informed by the troops
on guard in front of the camp that an unusual quantity of dust was
visible in the direction in which the legion had gone. When he had
advanced ‘some little distance’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paulo longius</i>) from the camp,
he saw that his troops were in difficulties; and he tells us that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">599</span>
place to which they had gone was the only [accessible] spot in which
the corn had not been cut, and that there were woods close by.
In repelling an attack which was made upon his camp just before
his departure, he made use of Commius’s small troop of cavalry,
and immediately afterwards he ‘burned all the buildings far and
wide’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnibus longe lateque aedificiis incensis</i>). On his return
voyage he set sail soon after midnight.</p>

<p>The flotilla with which he sailed for Britain in the following year
consisted of more than 800 vessels. Of these over 540 were transports
and 28 war-galleys, while the rest belonged to individuals.<a id="FNanchor_2941" href="#Footnote_2941" class="fnanchor">2941</a>
Some of the vessels used in the former expedition had been repaired:
the rest were built and rigged by Caesar’s troops during the winter
of 55-54 <small>B.C.</small>, and the following spring. The transports drew very
little water, and were adapted for rowing as well as sailing; and,
to provide room for troop-horses and stores, they were made proportionately
broader than the trading vessels used by the Italians
in the Mediterranean. Carrying five legions and 2,000 cavalry,
they sailed from the Portus Itius ‘about sunset’(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad solis occasum</i>),
with a light south-westerly breeze. About midnight the wind
dropped: the fleet was carried far out of its course by the tidal
stream; and at daybreak Caesar ‘descried Britain lying behind
on the left’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Britanniam sub sinistra relictam conspexit</i>). He then
followed the turn of the tide, and, as he tells us, ‘rowed hard to
gain the part of the island where, as he had learned in the preceding
summer, it was best to land’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">remis contendit ut eam partem insulae
caperet qua optimum esse egressum superiore aestate cognoverat</i>).
He remarks that the soldiers who rowed the heavily-laden transports
deserved great credit for their unremitting labour, which
enabled them to keep up with the war-galleys. The whole fleet had
reached the coast by about noon. No enemy was to be seen; and
Caesar learned afterwards from prisoners that large forces had
collected at the landing-place, but that, panic-stricken by the sight
of 800 vessels, they had abandoned the shore and retreated to
‘higher ground’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">superiora loca</i>).</p>

<p>After the disembarkation Caesar selected a suitable spot for his
camp. ‘About the third watch’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de tertia vigilia</i>) he marched to
encounter the enemy, whose whereabouts he had ascertained from
prisoners. He left the ships riding at anchor in charge of ten cohorts
and 300 cavalry; and he describes the anchorage as on ‘a nice
open shore’<a id="FNanchor_2942" href="#Footnote_2942" class="fnanchor">2942</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">litore molli atque aperto</i>). The force which accompanied
him consisted of four legions and 1,700 horse. After a march of about
12 Roman miles he descried the enemy. They advanced with their
cavalry and chariots ‘from the higher ground’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex loco superiore</i>)<a id="FNanchor_2943" href="#Footnote_2943" class="fnanchor">2943</a>
to the banks of a stream, and attempted to prevent the Romans
from crossing. Repulsed by Caesar’s cavalry, they took refuge in
a stronghold in the neighbouring woods, which is described by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">600</span>
Caesar as ‘a well-fortified post of great natural strength’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locum
egregie et natura et opere munitum</i>).</p>

<p>In a storm which occurred on the following night most of the
ships were driven ashore, about 40 being totally wrecked; and in
order to prevent a repetition of this disaster, the ships were all
hauled up on dry land and ‘connected with the camp by one entrenchment’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum castris una munitione coniungi</i>).</p>

<p>In his general description of Britain Caesar says that neither
the beech nor the fir grow in the island.<a id="FNanchor_2944" href="#Footnote_2944" class="fnanchor">2944</a> He describes it as triangular,
and says that one of its sides faces Gaul, and that ‘one
corner of this side, by Kent&mdash;the part which almost all ships from
Gaul make for&mdash;has an easterly, and the lower one a southerly
outlook’. Of the other two sides one, he says, ‘trends westward
towards Spain’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alterum vergit ad Hispaniam atque occidentem
solem</i>); while the other has a northerly aspect, and ‘its corner
looks if anything in the direction of Germany’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eius angulus lateris
maxime ad Germaniam spectat</i>).</p>

<p>The territories of Cassivellaunus were ‘separated from those of
the maritime tribes by a river called the Thames, about 80 [Roman]
miles from the sea’.</p>

<p>On the second of the two voyages by which the troops were transported
back to Gaul in 54 <small>B.C.</small>, the ships started in a dead calm
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summa tranquillitate</i>) at the beginning of the second watch, and
reached harbour at daybreak.<a id="FNanchor_2945" href="#Footnote_2945" class="fnanchor">2945</a></p>

<p>The only piece of evidence worth quoting which is not in the
<cite>Commentaries</cite> is the statement of Dion,<a id="FNanchor_2946" href="#Footnote_2946" class="fnanchor">2946</a> that Caesar, in sailing from
his anchorage to his landing-place in 55 <small>B.C.</small>, rounded a promontory.
Some commentators, however, believe that important additional
evidence is furnished by Plutarch and Valerius Maximus; and the
statements in question will be considered in subsequent sections of
this article.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg600">III. THE DAY ON WHICH CAESAR LANDED IN 55 <small>B.C.</small></h3>

<p>It is absolutely certain, and is universally admitted, that the full
moon which Caesar mentions occurred on the night of August 30-1,
55 <small>B.C.</small>:<a id="FNanchor_2947" href="#Footnote_2947" class="fnanchor">2947</a> to speak more precisely, it occurred at 3 h. 33 m. a.m.
on the 31st.<a id="FNanchor_2948" href="#Footnote_2948" class="fnanchor">2948</a> Now, with one or two exceptions, which shall be
presently considered, the commentators have concluded that Caesar
landed on the fourth day before the full moon, that is to say, on
the 27th of August. But any one who has read this article with
close attention will have seen that their conclusion rests upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">601</span>
a careless interpretation of Caesar’s narrative. Caesar says that
the eighteen cavalry transports sailed from Gaul on the fourth day
after he landed in Britain; that when they were approaching
the island they were prevented from keeping their course by a
storm; that some of them were driven westward down the coast
and anchored, but were obliged to run back, in the face of night,
for the Continent; and that on the same night there was a full
moon.<a id="FNanchor_2949" href="#Footnote_2949" class="fnanchor">2949</a> Whereupon the commentators leap to the conclusion that
the day on which Caesar landed was the fourth before the full
moon. They forget that what Caesar said was, not that the transports
approached the British coast on the fourth day after he landed,
but that on that day they started from Gaul. The distinction is
important. The transports may have weighed anchor in the night.
On all his four voyages Caesar set sail at night; and Strabo says
that for vessels sailing from Gaul this was the regular practice.<a id="FNanchor_2950" href="#Footnote_2950" class="fnanchor">2950</a>
Let us assume that Caesar landed on the 26th of August. Then,
if we adopt, as almost all the commentators have done, the inclusive
mode of reckoning, the transports may have sailed from Gaul on
the night of the 29th.<a id="FNanchor_2951" href="#Footnote_2951" class="fnanchor">2951</a> On the 30th, in the morning, they would
have been approaching Britain. Then came on the storm. On the
following night&mdash;the night of August 30-1&mdash;occurred the full moon.</p>

<p>It may be objected that if Caesar had landed in Britain on the
26th of August, and if his transports had set sail on the night of
the 29th, but after midnight&mdash;say between 2 and 3 a.m.&mdash;he would
have said that they set sail not on the fourth but on the fifth day
after his landing. I will take note of this objection, but I doubt
whether it is valid. In the thirty-third chapter of the Second Book
of the <cite>Commentaries</cite>, after describing the sortie made by the
Aduatuci, which took place in the third watch of the night, that
is to say after midnight, and their repulse, he goes on to say that
‘on the following day the gates were broken open’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">postridie eius
diei refractis portis</i> &amp;c.); in other words, he loosely reckoned the
third watch of the night as part of the day that preceded the one
which he calls <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">postridie eius diei</i>. It is therefore at least possible,
I think it probable, that he landed on the fifth day before the moon
which he described as full.</p>

<p>But it has been argued that Caesar may have made a mistake
in describing the moon as full. He remarks, as we have seen, that
the full moon produces very high tides in the Channel; and he
states that on the night of this particular full moon many of his
ships were waterlogged by an extraordinarily high tide. But the
strongest spring tides, in the eastern part of the Channel, between
Dungeness and Beachy Head, occur, not at the time of full moon,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_602">602</span>
but a day and a half later, and east of Dungeness two days later.<a id="FNanchor_2952" href="#Footnote_2952" class="fnanchor">2952</a>
Airy,<a id="FNanchor_2953" href="#Footnote_2953" class="fnanchor">2953</a> premising that ‘it is impossible to judge precisely of the day
of full moon, either from the appearance of the moon’s diameter
... or from the time of moon-rising’, argues that the moon which
Caesar described as full was probably, as a matter of fact, that
which produced the spring tide. Accordingly he assumes that
Caesar landed on the third day before the full moon.</p>

<p>Airy’s argument, however, is unsound. No well-informed man
needs to be told that, long before Caesar’s time, astronomers were
able to predict the phases of the moon with sufficient accuracy for
all ordinary purposes. Livy records that in 168 <small>B.C.</small> a tribune in
the army of Aemilius Paullus told his men that a lunar eclipse
would occur on the following night.<a id="FNanchor_2954" href="#Footnote_2954" class="fnanchor">2954</a> It is therefore at least not
unlikely that Caesar should have known on what night the full
moon which followed his landing occurred. The fact that the
extraordinarily high tide occurred on the night which he calls the
night of the full moon, presents no difficulty. The tide on the
night of the full moon, even though, in normal circumstances, it
would not have risen as high as a spring tide, properly so called,
would in any case have been unusually high; and under the influence
of the gale which Caesar mentions, its height would of course have
been increased. Extraordinarily high tides, indeed, have occurred
in such circumstances even at neaps;<a id="FNanchor_2955" href="#Footnote_2955" class="fnanchor">2955</a> and it would be just as
reasonable to argue that Caesar ante-dated the day in question as
that he post-dated it. For, as Airy himself assures us, the moon
would have appeared full on the night before it really was so, that
is to say, on the night of August 29-30; and if, as Airy assumes, full
moon had occurred on the night before that to which Caesar assigned
it, he would surely have noticed that the moon appeared
full on the two successive nights which preceded what, on Airy’s
hypothesis, he called the night of the full moon.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that it is not possible to say with absolute
certainty on what day Caesar landed. It is morally certain that he
adopted the inclusive method of reckoning.<a id="FNanchor_2956" href="#Footnote_2956" class="fnanchor">2956</a> It is, as we have seen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">603</span>
probable that he landed on the fifth, but he may have landed on
the fourth day before the moon which he described as full. It is
highly probable that he fixed the day of the full moon correctly;
but we cannot be perfectly sure. Accordingly it seems to me probable
that he landed on the 26th of August: but he may have
landed on the 27th, or possibly even on the 25th.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I assure the reader that this uncertainty matters
nothing. If he will bear with me to the end, he will see that we
shall be able, notwithstanding, to determine the place of landing.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg603">IV. DID CAESAR LAND AT THE SAME PLACE IN
BOTH HIS EXPEDITIONS?</h3>

<p>It remains to inquire whether, in both his expeditions, Caesar landed
at the same place. The commentators are virtually unanimous
in holding that he did; and Napoleon, whose view is an exception
to the rule, believes that the landing-place of 54 <small>B.C.</small> was only
a few kilometres north of that of the preceding year.<a id="FNanchor_2957" href="#Footnote_2957" class="fnanchor">2957</a> He and von
Göler<a id="FNanchor_2958" href="#Footnote_2958" class="fnanchor">2958</a> both rely on the express statement of Dion Cassius<a id="FNanchor_2959" href="#Footnote_2959" class="fnanchor">2959</a>; but
Dr. F. Vogel,<a id="FNanchor_2960" href="#Footnote_2960" class="fnanchor">2960</a> who attaches no importance to Dion’s testimony on
matters of this kind, reminds us that Caesar ‘speaks only of the
place which he had ascertained in the preceding year to be the best
for landing’,<a id="FNanchor_2961" href="#Footnote_2961" class="fnanchor">2961</a> and does not say that he had actually landed there.
I agree with Vogel that Dion’s statement proves nothing; for
there is no reason to suppose that it represents anything but his
own interpretation of Caesar’s words. Nevertheless, it is certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">604</span>
that Caesar did land in the same ‘part of the island’<a id="FNanchor_2962" href="#Footnote_2962" class="fnanchor">2962</a> in 54 <small>B.C.</small>
and in 55. For, as we shall subsequently see, if he landed on both
occasions in East Kent, the coast which answers to the requirements
of his narrative lies within the extreme limits of Walmer and Sandwich:
if in 55 <small>B.C.</small> he landed at any point west of the South Foreland,
it is not possible to suggest any reason why he should have chosen
in the following year a new landing-place also on the west of that
promontory but in a different ‘part of the island’; and not only
has it never been suggested, but it is incredible that he should have
landed in 55 <small>B.C.</small> on one side, and in 54 on the other side of the South
Foreland.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add that before his fleet hove in sight
in 54 <small>B.C.</small> the Britons assembled in great force to oppose his landing:
in other words, they felt sure that he would attempt to land at or
near the place where he had landed the year before.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg604">V. THE VARIOUS THEORIES ABOUT CAESAR’S
PLACE OF LANDING</h3>

<p>Not less than a dozen different theories have been formed regarding
the place of Caesar’s landing. It has been identified with Weybourne
on the coast of Norfolk; with Richborough; with the
neighbourhood of Sandwich; with Deal, or, to speak more correctly,
the coast between Deal Castle and Walmer Castle; with Dover,
Folkestone, Hythe, Lympne, Hurst on the northern fringe of Romney
Marsh, Bonnington near Appledore, Rye, Bulverhythe, and Pevensey.
Most of these theories, however, obviously fall into groups. Richborough,
Sandwich, and Deal; Hythe, Lympne, Hurst, and Bonnington;
Bulverhythe and Pevensey,&mdash;these three groups represent
three main theories, each of which has undergone modification in
detail. The rest may be summarily dismissed. The absurd suggestion
that Caesar landed in Norfolk was elaborated in two successive
pamphlets;<a id="FNanchor_2963" href="#Footnote_2963" class="fnanchor">2963</a> and, what is still more amazing, a zealous antiquary
thought it necessary to devote a third<a id="FNanchor_2964" href="#Footnote_2964" class="fnanchor">2964</a> to its refutation. Neither
Folkestone nor Rye has now any advocates; and the absurdity of
their pretensions must be self-evident to every intelligent reader of
the <cite>Commentaries</cite>. The theory that Caesar landed at Dover is only
worth mentioning because it was seriously maintained by the
eminent geographer, Konrad Mannert;<a id="FNanchor_2965" href="#Footnote_2965" class="fnanchor">2965</a> and perhaps Heller underestimated
the acumen of his readers when he took the trouble to
confute it.<a id="FNanchor_2966" href="#Footnote_2966" class="fnanchor">2966</a> The claim of Bonnington was maintained with considerable
ingenuity by a professional advocate in a book<a id="FNanchor_2967" href="#Footnote_2967" class="fnanchor">2967</a> which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_605">605</span>
George Long,<a id="FNanchor_2968" href="#Footnote_2968" class="fnanchor">2968</a> who dissented from its conclusions, commended as
‘a work of real value’; and it would not be safe to ignore it.
Even the view that Caesar landed at Pevensey demands consideration.
It was first put forward in 1852 by the late Astronomer
Royal, who defended it against a series of attacks with equal ability
and vivacity: a few years ago it was resuscitated by Professor
Ridgeway: Mr. Warde Fowler<a id="FNanchor_2969" href="#Footnote_2969" class="fnanchor">2969</a> observes that ‘much can be said
in favour of this opinion’; and the late Camden Professor of Ancient
History in the University of Oxford<a id="FNanchor_2970" href="#Footnote_2970" class="fnanchor">2970</a> was inclined to accept it. But
the controversies which have attracted most attention have been
centred between the advocates of Lympne or Hythe on the one side
and of Deal or Sandwich on the other. And, although there are
many collateral questions, the chief point at issue is this,&mdash;when
Caesar sailed with wind and tide in his favour from the place where
he anchored on the morning of his first voyage, and steered for the
place where he landed, was the tidal stream running up or down
the Channel? Among those who have recently approached the
subject the prevailing belief would appear to be that it has been
proved that he sailed down. ‘The old belief,’ writes Mr. Warde
Fowler,<a id="FNanchor_2971" href="#Footnote_2971" class="fnanchor">2971</a> ‘that he turned eastwards and landed at Deal cannot, in
the present state of our knowledge of the tides, be any longer maintained.’
I engage to convince every reader who will give me his
attention that the so-called proof is no proof at all.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg605">VI. THE QUESTION OF THE TIDES</h3>

<p>Before we attempt to construct a tide-table for the 26th and 27th
of August, 55 <small>B.C.</small>, we must first satisfy ourselves whether in that
year, at any given period of the moon’s age, the tidal stream in the
eastern part of the English Channel began to flow and to ebb at
precisely the same time as it does in similar circumstances now.
On this point there has been much divergence of opinion. Dr.
Guest, the late geologist George Dowker, and Professor Montagu
Burrows have all argued that the changes which have taken place
in the configuration of the coast<a id="FNanchor_2972" href="#Footnote_2972" class="fnanchor">2972</a> must have produced changes in
the tidal currents. The points on which Dr. Guest laid special
stress were, that in Caesar’s time Thanet was an island; that
Dungeness did not then exist; that Romney Marsh was covered at
high tide by an estuary 50,000 acres in extent; and that the estuary
of the Thames was far wider than it is now.<a id="FNanchor_2973" href="#Footnote_2973" class="fnanchor">2973</a> Dowker called attention
to the great changes which, since Caesar’s time, must have
taken place in the Goodwin Sands: ‘would no effect,’ he asked,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">606</span>
‘be felt by the tides if the Goodwins were now an island?’ Again,
observing that Drew ‘points out how the beach formerly near Rye
had been swept away, and re-deposited in a different direction’,
he concluded that ‘geological changes of outline have altered the
direction and velocity of the currents’.<a id="FNanchor_2974" href="#Footnote_2974" class="fnanchor">2974</a> Some years later he returned
to the subject. ‘If,’ he wrote,<a id="FNanchor_2975" href="#Footnote_2975" class="fnanchor">2975</a> ‘we assume the Straits
are now one mile wider than when Caesar visited our shores,<a id="FNanchor_2976" href="#Footnote_2976" class="fnanchor">2976</a> the
tide which runs with a velocity of about three miles an hour up
Channel, would carry more water into the German Ocean than
a river a mile wide and 15 feet deep.... There are other changes
also that have taken place in the German Ocean, which must have
exerted immense influence on the tides when we remember that
a north-east wind will materially heighten the tidal lever by forcing
up the water of the North Sea. The travelling of beach in an eastward
direction shows that the set of the tide is more strong in that
direction now on some part of the coast than formerly.’ Finally,
Professor Montagu Burrows remarks<a id="FNanchor_2977" href="#Footnote_2977" class="fnanchor">2977</a> that ‘Not only may the
depth of the Channel have largely varied, but the space over which
the tides travel must be at least two miles wider than it was some
2,000 years ago,<a id="FNanchor_2978" href="#Footnote_2978" class="fnanchor">2978</a> and therefore the point of meeting of the North and
South tide-streams cannot possibly be exactly the same’.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Airy says, ‘I express my opinion without
hesitation that no conceivable changes in the coast within historical
times can have produced any sensible change in the relation
of the tidal currents to the moon’s age.’<a id="FNanchor_2979" href="#Footnote_2979" class="fnanchor">2979</a></p>

<p>I have submitted these remarks to Sir George Darwin, the author
of the articles on the tides in the Ninth Edition of the <cite>Encyclopaedia
Britannica</cite> and the Supplement to that edition. ‘In my opinion,’
he replies, ‘Airy is absolutely right and Burrows and the others
wrong. A channel from Sandwich to Reculver could not have made
any sensible change, and so also it would be impossible to detect
the difference if Goodwin Sands were an island. All the phenomena
now observed must have occurred at the same times within, say,
a minute, and with an intensity measurably identical in the days
of Caesar. Even if you were in a position to indicate exactly the
nature of the changes in the channel since that time, it would be
impossible to compute the nature of the <i>excessively minute</i> changes
in the currents.’</p>

<p>This decisive answer will not be seriously gainsaid. Evidently
the divergence of opinion is between those who are not and those
who are qualified to judge.</p>

<p>Airy says that ‘on the day of Caesar’s landing the tide off Dover
turned to the west about 1 h. in the afternoon, and at 3 h. it would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_607">607</span>
be running with a strong stream to the west’.<a id="FNanchor_2980" href="#Footnote_2980" class="fnanchor">2980</a> Airy, as we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_2981" href="#Footnote_2981" class="fnanchor">2981</a>
supposes that the day of Caesar’s landing was the 28th of August;
but if the statement which I have just quoted is accurate, it follows
that even on the 26th the tide at 3 p.m. was running westward.
Again, in 1866, the Admiralty Hydrographer affirmed that on the
27th of August, 55 <small>B.C.</small>, the current ran westward until 6.30 p.m.;<a id="FNanchor_2982" href="#Footnote_2982" class="fnanchor">2982</a>
and if he is right, it must on the previous day, unless the circumstances
were abnormal, have continued flowing in the same direction
until 5 p.m. or later. Lewin,<a id="FNanchor_2983" href="#Footnote_2983" class="fnanchor">2983</a> relying upon a table compiled by
a Mr. Barton of Dover, and based upon observations made by
‘some experienced pilot or fisherman’, and upon another table
filled up from actual observation ‘on every day of July, 1862’,
states that ‘with high water ... at 7.31 a.m., the tide could not
turn eastward at the earliest until 4.26 p.m., and at the latest not
until 5.21 p.m.’ Nevertheless, he admits<a id="FNanchor_2984" href="#Footnote_2984" class="fnanchor">2984</a> that, with high tide at
7.31 a.m., the tide might possibly have turned eastward at 4 p.m.
Finally, Mr. H. E. Malden tells us that ‘at any time that afternoon
between two o’clock and seven, in any part of the Channel between
Dunge Ness and Dover, the tidal current was running westward ...
when Sir George Airy, the greatest authority of the century upon
the tides, says that they were the same then as now, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cadit quaestio</i>.
We are lifted out of the uncertainties of historical topography into
the certainties of scientific knowledge.’<a id="FNanchor_2985" href="#Footnote_2985" class="fnanchor">2985</a></p>

<p>This pronouncement is certainly calculated to overawe the timid
inquirer. Nevertheless, I venture to suggest that a man who knows
little or nothing about the tides should refrain from patting on the
back one who knew a great deal, but who did not think it necessary
for his purpose to tell all that he knew.</p>

<p>Airy may have been the greatest authority of the century upon
the tides: but, apart from his asseveration that they were the same
then as now, in the contribution which he made to the solution of
the problem which we are investigating he relied upon authorities
which are accessible to everybody. Those authorities (I will mention
a few besides those which Airy used) are the <cite>Nautical Almanac</cite>;
<cite>Tide Tables for the British and Irish Ports</cite> (published by order of
the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty); the <cite>Channel Pilot</cite>;
<cite>Tidal Streams, English and Irish Channels</cite> (an Atlas of 12 charts
published at the Admiralty in 1899); Captain Usborne Moore’s
<cite>Report on Observations ... in the Straits of Dover</cite> (also published
at the Admiralty in 1899); an article by Admiral Sir F. W. Beechey
published in <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite>, volume cxli, 1851, pages
703-18; and an article published in <cite>Archaeologia</cite>, volume xxxix,
1863, pages 277-302. The last-named article includes a report of
observations on the tidal streams in the Straits of Dover, made in
1862 under the superintendence of E. K. Calver, R.N. These
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_608">608</span>
observations were made for the purpose of settling the question
whether the stream with which Caesar sailed from his anchorage
ran up or down the Channel. They were made ‘in comparatively
still weather’ on the 21st of August, the 4th and 5th of September,
and the 4th of October, 1862, at eleven distinct stations within
a space extending to one mile and a half from the shore, and from
the South Foreland to Shakespeare’s Cliff. The days on which
they were made were, reckoning inclusively, respectively the fifth
before the new moon, and the fifth, the fourth, and the fourth before
the full moon. ‘From the average of these observations,’ says
Calver, ‘it appears that, when high water at Dover occurs about
7 h. 30 m. a.m., the inshore flood or easterly-going stream ... turns
4 h. 48 m. after it is high water upon the shore. Taking then, for
example, a 7 h. 31 m. a.m. high water, and assuming that the ebb
or westerly-going stream runs on the average for 6¼ hours, it follows
that the flood or easterly-going stream on that day would turn off
Dover at 12 h. 19 m., and the succeeding ebb ... would run to the
westward until 6 h. 34 m. p.m.<a id="FNanchor_2986" href="#Footnote_2986" class="fnanchor">2986</a>’ Vice-Admiral W. H. Smyth,
summing up the results of the observations, remarked that the tide
turned westward ‘soonest near the beach and latest in the offing’,
and that ‘the turn is sooner to the east of Dover than to the west,
still not differing more than one hour’.<a id="FNanchor_2987" href="#Footnote_2987" class="fnanchor">2987</a></p>

<p>So far as we have yet examined them, the results of these observations
fully bear out what Airy and Lewin maintain,&mdash;if it is assumed
that high tide at Dover on the day of Caesar’s landing must have
occurred about 7.30 a.m. But if we scrutinize the tables more
closely, and give due weight to certain other facts emphasized by our
authorities, we shall see that the dogmatism of Airy and Lewin is
unjustifiable. They and their followers make no allowance for the
great influence which winds exert upon the tidal streams in the
Channel.<a id="FNanchor_2988" href="#Footnote_2988" class="fnanchor">2988</a> Moreover, it is useless to base conclusions upon the
average of the results obtained in Surveyor Calver’s observations.
If we scan the tables which give those results in detail, we shall find
that although, on the average, the stream turned westward 4 h. 48 m.
after high water at Dover, yet on the 21st of August it turned only
3 h. 40 m. after high water.<a id="FNanchor_2989" href="#Footnote_2989" class="fnanchor">2989</a> We shall also find that the duration
of the flood, as observed by Calver, varied from 4 to 7 hours; and
although the duration of the ebb was only observed twice,<a id="FNanchor_2990" href="#Footnote_2990" class="fnanchor">2990</a> it may
actually have varied as much. On the first of the two occasions on
which it was observed it was 6 hours, 10 minutes; on the second,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_609">609</span>
only 5 hours, 53 minutes;<a id="FNanchor_2991" href="#Footnote_2991" class="fnanchor">2991</a> and, according to the <cite>Channel Pilot</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_2992" href="#Footnote_2992" class="fnanchor">2992</a> it
is occasionally only 4 hours. Therefore it is possible that if on the
day of Caesar’s landing high water occurred at Dover at 7.31 a.m.,
the tide may have turned westward as early as 11.11 a.m., and
may have continued to run westward for a period not longer than
5 hours, 53 minutes, that is to say, until 5.4 p.m.</p>

<p>But this is not all. It is desirable that the reader should become
acquainted with Lewin’s methods of reasoning. Lewin himself,
after studying the <cite>Admiralty Tide Tables</cite> for the year 1859, admits
that ‘on January 14th, being the fourth day before the full moon,
high water at Dover is at 5.31 a.m.’, and that it may possibly have
occurred as early on the day of Caesar’s landing. This admission
throws a breaking strain upon his theory; but by dint of dexterous
manipulation of the facts he is just able to make a show of saving
it from ignominious collapse. ‘As’ he says, ‘the stream turns at
four hours after high water, and continues for seven hours, it turns
at the earliest at 9.31 a.m. and runs till 4.31 p.m.... In no case,
therefore, would the tide be running east at 3 p.m.’ But Lewin
is here compelled to ignore observations of which, in another part
of his book, he makes free use. As we have already seen, he admits<a id="FNanchor_2993" href="#Footnote_2993" class="fnanchor">2993</a>
that on a day when high tide occurred at 7.31 a.m. the stream might
turn eastward at 4.26 or even at 4 p.m. If he is right, it follows
that on a day when high tide occurred at 5.31 a.m. the stream
might turn eastward at 2.26 or even at 2 p.m. To make this admission,
from which, if he had been confronted with his own words,
he could by no subtlety have escaped, would have been to throw
up his case; and such candour would have been too much to expect
from a professional advocate. Let him, however, shift his ground,
if he pleases, and rely upon Calver’s observations. They will not
avail him. We have just seen that, according to Calver, the stream
turned westward on the 21st of August, 1862, 3 h. 40 m. after high
water; and the duration of the westward stream, on one of the
two occasions on which he observed it, was only 5 h. 53 m.<a id="FNanchor_2994" href="#Footnote_2994" class="fnanchor">2994</a> According
to these data, if, on the day of Caesar’s landing, high tide had
occurred at 5.31 a.m., the westward stream might have ceased at
3.4 p.m. It would have been impossible for Lewin, if he had been
required to take account of this statement, to deny it. But to admit
it would have been to sign the death-warrant of his own theory.</p>

<p>So far I have only been concerned to show that Lewin’s whole
train of reasoning, examined in the light of the evidence which
he himself adduces, is radically unsound. I have argued on his
hypothesis&mdash;that high tide at Dover, on the day of Caesar’s landing,
<i>may</i> have occurred at the earliest time at which it can possibly
occur on the fourth day before the full moon. Neither Lewin nor
Airy nor any other commentator has attempted to determine, by
the aid of lunar tables, the hour at which, on the day in question,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_610">610</span>
high tide did actually occur.<a id="FNanchor_2995" href="#Footnote_2995" class="fnanchor">2995</a> Nevertheless, if the problem which
we intend to solve is to be attacked in a scientific spirit, the hour
ought to be determined. Messrs. John A. Sprigge, William Fraser
Doak, M.A., F.R.A.S., and T. Charlton Hudson, B.A., F.R.A.S.,
all of the Nautical Almanac Office, have been so kind as to determine
it for me. Their calculations are preserved; and at the end of this
article, on page 665, will be found a memorandum, in which they
have described the method on which they worked. It will be sufficient
here to state the results, the error in which, as they point out,
is probably insignificant. On the 26th of August, 55 <small>B.C.</small>, the Greenwich
mean time of high water at Dover was 6.21 a.m.; on the 27th,
7.42 a.m.; and on the 28th, 8.44 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_2996" href="#Footnote_2996" class="fnanchor">2996</a> Thus it turns out that on
the day of Caesar’s landing high water did not occur at all early.
This fact, however, will not sustain the theory of Airy and Lewin.
Since high water at Dover on the 26th of August occurred at 6.21
a.m., and since the tidal stream, according to one of Calver’s observations,
turned 3 hours, 40 minutes after high water, the stream
may have turned westward at 10.1 a.m. Assuming that the duration
of the westward stream was 5 hours, 53 minutes&mdash;the same as
that recorded on one occasion by Calver&mdash;the stream would have
ceased at 3.54 p.m. But Calver’s observations were made ‘in
comparatively still weather’;<a id="FNanchor_2997" href="#Footnote_2997" class="fnanchor">2997</a> and, to quote Admiral Beechey,
‘winds greatly affect the time of turn of the stream.’<a id="FNanchor_2998" href="#Footnote_2998" class="fnanchor">2998</a> Now Caesar
sailed from his anchorage with wind as well as tide in his favour;
and the wind which carried him to his landing-place may have
accelerated the turn of the stream. It is clear, therefore, that on
the day of Caesar’s landing the stream may have turned eastward
earlier than 3.54 p.m.; and if it turned twenty-five minutes earlier,
it turned in ‘the ninth hour’.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_611">611</span></p>

<p>But, it will be objected, Caesar may have landed on the 27th of
August; and in that case the stream could not have turned eastward
before the close of the ninth hour. Certainly it could not
have done so unless it had turned westward unusually early, or
unless its westward duration had but little exceeded four hours;
and although this has been shown to be within the bounds of possibility,<a id="FNanchor_2999" href="#Footnote_2999" class="fnanchor">2999</a>
it is to the last degree improbable. But if he landed on the
26th of August, an assumption which has been proved to be not
inconsistent with his narrative,<a id="FNanchor_3000" href="#Footnote_3000" class="fnanchor">3000</a> it is not improbable that the stream
may have turned eastward in the ninth hour; and this is all that
I am concerned at present to show.</p>

<p>It may be said that, in order to refute the dogma of Airy and
Lewin, I have supposed an extreme case. I can only say that I did
not start with the intention either of refuting or defending that
dogma: I merely examined it, and found that it would not bear
examination. And I am justified in supposing an extreme, or rather
an exceptional, case because Airy and Lewin have both affirmed
that it is absolutely impossible that in the ninth hour on the day of
Caesar’s first landing in Britain the tidal stream can have been
running towards the east. But, supposing that it did not turn
eastward until after the ninth hour, still the theory that Caesar must
have sailed in the opposite direction will not stand. For the reader,
if he has patience to bear with me to the end, will convince himself,
from Caesar’s own words, that Caesar did not stir from his
anchorage until after the ninth hour had passed.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg611">VII. THE THEORY THAT CAESAR LANDED AT
PEVENSEY</h3>

<p>The two distinguished advocates of the theory that Caesar landed
at Pevensey are not in complete accord. Airy holds that he sailed
both in 55 and in 54 <small>B.C.</small> from the mouth of the Somme;<a id="FNanchor_3001" href="#Footnote_3001" class="fnanchor">3001</a> Professor
Ridgeway from Wissant.<a id="FNanchor_3002" href="#Footnote_3002" class="fnanchor">3002</a> It has been proved in my article on the
Portus Itius that he started from Boulogne; and whoever accepts
that proof will, perhaps, skip this section. I am willing, however,
for the sake of argument, to accept in turn both Airy’s identification
of the Portus Itius and that of Professor Ridgeway: but I may
remark that when Airy wrote he had forgotten that in Caesar’s
time there was a natural harbour at Pevensey;<a id="FNanchor_3003" href="#Footnote_3003" class="fnanchor">3003</a> and if Caesar had
landed in a harbour he would not have left the fact unnoticed.</p>

<p>If we are to accept the premiss on which Airy himself lays so
much stress, namely, that in 55 <small>B.C.</small> the tidal currents in the Channel,
at any given period of the moon’s age, were the same as they are now,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_612">612</span>
Caesar did not land at Pevensey. Airy, as we have seen, assumes
that Caesar landed, in 55 <small>B.C.</small>, on the third day before the full moon,
and, appealing to the authority of Sir F. W. Beechey, he affirms
that, off Hastings, the current turns westward five miles from the
coast two hours later than it does close inshore. ‘If,’ he concludes,
‘we suppose Caesar to have first attempted the neighbourhood of
St. Leonards, the tide, which a few miles from shore had turned
to the west at 11 h., was, at 3 h., running in full stream to the west.’<a id="FNanchor_3004" href="#Footnote_3004" class="fnanchor">3004</a>
But, in order to prop up his theory, Airy is forced to place Caesar’s
anchorage at five nautical or nearly six statute miles from the
shore. To prove that such an assumption is absurd, it is only
necessary to say that, at a distance of five nautical miles, Caesar
could not have seen the armed men who, as he tells us,<a id="FNanchor_3005" href="#Footnote_3005" class="fnanchor">3005</a> were swarming
upon the cliffs, without the assistance of a powerful telescope.<a id="FNanchor_3006" href="#Footnote_3006" class="fnanchor">3006</a>
Lewin<a id="FNanchor_3007" href="#Footnote_3007" class="fnanchor">3007</a> rightly concludes that Caesar must have anchored within
a mile from the shore, at the outside, and probably within half a mile.
Now high water at Dover on the 27th of August, 55 <small>B.C.</small>, occurred
at 7.42, and therefore at Hastings at 7.23 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_3008" href="#Footnote_3008" class="fnanchor">3008</a> But off Hastings,
within a mile from the shore, the current turns westward about
the time of high tide,<a id="FNanchor_3009" href="#Footnote_3009" class="fnanchor">3009</a> runs westward for about six hours and a half,
and then runs eastward for about six hours. At 3 p.m., therefore,
on the 27th of August, the tide off Hastings would have been running
eastward, and would have continued to do so until about 7.50 p.m.
And on the 28th of August, which Airy wrongly assumes to have
been the day of Caesar’s landing, the tide off Hastings would have
turned eastward about 2.53 p.m., and would have continued to
run in that direction until about 8.53. Consequently, on the theory
of the tides which Airy himself so strenuously maintains, it would
have been impossible for Caesar to sail with the tide from Hastings
or from St. Leonards to Pevensey.<a id="FNanchor_3010" href="#Footnote_3010" class="fnanchor">3010</a> Even on Airy’s assumption
that Caesar anchored five nautical miles from the shore, his theory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_613">613</span>
cannot stand: he can only make a show of propping it up by assuming
that Caesar landed on the 28th of August. On the 27th,
the stream would have turned westward at about 9.30 a.m., and
would have ceased running westward about 4 p.m. Therefore, even
supposing that Caesar started on his seven miles’ sail in the ninth
hour,<a id="FNanchor_3011" href="#Footnote_3011" class="fnanchor">3011</a> he would have done so on the very last of the tidal stream,
when it was barely moving; and it would have turned against
him before he had half finished his voyage.</p>

<p>Very wisely, from his own point of view&mdash;for his silence has
hitherto passed unnoticed&mdash;Airy ignored Caesar’s account of the
voyage of his cavalry transports. Some of them, as we have seen,
were ‘swept down in great peril’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magno suo cum periculo deicerentur</i><a id="FNanchor_3012" href="#Footnote_3012" class="fnanchor">3012</a>),
evidently running before the gale, ‘to the lower and more
westerly part of the island’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad inferiorem partem insulac quae est
propius solis occasum</i><a id="FNanchor_3013" href="#Footnote_3013" class="fnanchor">3013</a>): the others were carried back to the port
from which they had started. That port, according to Airy, was
the mouth of the Authie. The gale evidently blew from about the
north-east; but, in order to give Airy the fullest latitude, I will
assume that it was from the north-north-east, although in either case
the ships which ran before the wind, once they had got under the
lee of Beachy Head, would have been in smooth water! The
course which the transports would have had to steer for the Authie,
if they had been sighted off Pevensey, would have been SE. by
E. 2° S., or within less than nine points of the wind. But in the
gale they could hardly have made less than four points of lee-way.<a id="FNanchor_3014" href="#Footnote_3014" class="fnanchor">3014</a>
Therefore, in order to reach their supposed destination, they would
have been obliged to lie within less than five points of the wind,
which they could not have done.<a id="FNanchor_3015" href="#Footnote_3015" class="fnanchor">3015</a> ‘No!’ said the harbour-master
of Dover to me, after he had studied the chart, ‘No! they would
have fetched Dieppe.’<a id="FNanchor_3016" href="#Footnote_3016" class="fnanchor">3016</a> I have assumed that they could work to
windward: if they could not, it is self-evident that they could not
have returned to the mouth of the Authie.</p>

<p>But if any one is not convinced, let him hear Airy plead his own
cause.</p>

<p>1. Airy argues that Volusenus would never have recommended
Caesar to land under the cliffs of Dover, or at any point under the
cliffs between Folkestone and Hythe. ‘No commander,’ he says,
‘would steer ships to a mural cliff three hundred feet high, with
the intention of landing in order to invade the country; nor would
any defenders station themselves there to repel an invasion; nor
could a “telum” be thrown with any aim. But a daring officer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_614">614</span>
might steer to a less perpendicular cliff, ten to thirty feet high,
with the intention of forcing a landing.... Such are the cliffs between
Hastings and Pevensey; and I conclude that they answer exactly
to Caesar’s description.’ Assuming that the cliffs off which Caesar
anchored, when he first approached the British coast, were in the
neighbourhood of St. Leonards, Airy affirms that ‘the run of eight<a id="FNanchor_3017" href="#Footnote_3017" class="fnanchor">3017</a>
miles would bring him to the beach of Pevensey, answering perfectly
to his description’.<a id="FNanchor_3018" href="#Footnote_3018" class="fnanchor">3018</a></p>

<p>Now whether Caesar did or did not steer towards ‘a mural cliff
three hundred feet high’, he certainly anchored off cliffs which he
calls ‘precipitous heights’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angusti montes</i>); and Airy makes too
great a demand upon our credulity when he requires us to believe
that Caesar described by the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angusti montes</i> a ‘cliff ten to
thirty feet high’. So much for the theory that Caesar anchored off
the clifflets of St. Leonards:<a id="FNanchor_3019" href="#Footnote_3019" class="fnanchor">3019</a> the argument that he could not have
anchored off the cliffs of Dover shall be considered in its proper
place. The reader has of course already observed that Volusenus,
being a sane man, would never have recommended Caesar to ‘force
a landing’ under any cliffs, great or small.</p>

<p>2. Airy argues that the Britons would naturally have assembled
at Pevensey in order to oppose Caesar’s landing, because ‘Pevensey
was the weakest point of Britain’.<a id="FNanchor_3020" href="#Footnote_3020" class="fnanchor">3020</a> No! replies Lewin, Pevensey
was not <i>then</i> the weakest point; for it was ‘backed by the Andred
Forest’.<a id="FNanchor_3021" href="#Footnote_3021" class="fnanchor">3021</a> Airy<a id="FNanchor_3022" href="#Footnote_3022" class="fnanchor">3022</a> triumphantly observes that William the Conqueror
landed there; but Lewin<a id="FNanchor_3023" href="#Footnote_3023" class="fnanchor">3023</a> rejoins that when William landed the
forest presented less difficulty to an invader than in Caesar’s time,
as the Romans and the Saxons must have made clearances. Be
this as it may, it is certain that William did not attempt to march
northward through the forest. He returned, immediately after
his victory, to Hastings: from Hastings he marched eastward to
Romney, and from Romney to Dover.<a id="FNanchor_3024" href="#Footnote_3024" class="fnanchor">3024</a> He had his own reasons for
landing at Pevensey: but Caesar, for reasons equally good, chose
the shortest passage; and although, as I have shown,<a id="FNanchor_3025" href="#Footnote_3025" class="fnanchor">3025</a> these words
are not to be taken in an absolutely literal sense, they alone exclude
the notion that Caesar landed in Sussex. Obviously it is in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_615">615</span>
last degree improbable that Volusenus would have reconnoitred
the coast so far westward as Pevensey; nor could the Britons have
expected that Caesar would be so foolish as to double the length of
his voyage in order to land there.<a id="FNanchor_3026" href="#Footnote_3026" class="fnanchor">3026</a></p>

<p>3. Airy argued that, except on the hypothesis that Caesar landed
at Pevensey, it is impossible to account for the long duration of his
first voyage. His rate of sailing, said Airy, if, as Dr. Guest maintained,
he had started from Wissant and anchored off the Dover
cliffs, would not have exceeded two miles an hour. ‘When in Shetland,’
he adds, ‘I have sailed in one of the ordinary fishing-boats
of the country, hoisting a single lug-sail ... with a pleasant, easy
breeze (sometimes dying away), from Lerwick to the head of Balta
Sound, in Unst, in about eight hours. The distance, as measured
on the Admiralty Chart, exceeds forty nautical miles.’<a id="FNanchor_3027" href="#Footnote_3027" class="fnanchor">3027</a></p>

<p>This was one of Airy’s more plausible arguments; and it demands
consideration. To begin with, it must be pointed out that Caesar
did not, as Dr. Guest believed, sail from Wissant, but from Boulogne,
which is more than seven nautical miles further from Dover. Airy
assumed<a id="FNanchor_3028" href="#Footnote_3028" class="fnanchor">3028</a> that Caesar’s first voyage lasted from midnight till 10 a.m.
But it is impossible to say how long it lasted. Caesar does not say
that he started at midnight: he says that he started ‘about the
third watch’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tertia fere vigilia</i>); and the third watch lasted, on the
night of the 25th-26th of August, from midnight till 2.32 a.m.,
on the night of the 26th-27th till 2.33 a.m.<a id="FNanchor_3029" href="#Footnote_3029" class="fnanchor">3029</a> Nor does he say that
he reached Britain at 10 a.m.; he says that he reached it ‘about
the fourth hour of the day’, which lasted on the 26th of August
from 8.33 to 9.42.<a id="FNanchor_3030" href="#Footnote_3030" class="fnanchor">3030</a> As Mr. Peskett says, ‘the possible duration of
the voyage lies between the extreme limits of 9 h. 40′ and 6 hours.’<a id="FNanchor_3031" href="#Footnote_3031" class="fnanchor">3031</a>
Split the difference, and you will find that the average rate of sailing
would have been about three knots and a half per hour. The answer
to Airy’s argument is that Caesar’s narrative is quite consistent
with the view that his ships may have remained for some time
anchored off the Gallic coast in the expectation that the cavalry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_616">616</span>
transports would sail out of Ambleteuse harbour to join them;
and, further, that the wind may have shifted to an unfavourable
quarter before the voyage was at an end.<a id="FNanchor_3032" href="#Footnote_3032" class="fnanchor">3032</a></p>

<p>4. Airy<a id="FNanchor_3033" href="#Footnote_3033" class="fnanchor">3033</a> maintains that a river corresponding with Caesar’s
description of the one on the banks of which he defeated the Britons
on the day after his second landing,<a id="FNanchor_3034" href="#Footnote_3034" class="fnanchor">3034</a> is to be found in the neighbourhood
of Pevensey, and of Pevensey only. That river, he says,
was the Rother, and the scene of the victory was Robertsbridge.
He produces evidence to show that if Rye Sluice were broken,
‘the whole valley at Robertsbridge would now become a great tidal
morass.’ This, he continues, ‘was its state in the age of Caesar,
and it must have been a very formidable defence against an army
advancing from the coast.’</p>

<p>Undoubtedly; so formidable that it would have been absolutely
impassable. How Caesar’s cavalry succeeded in forcing their way
over this ‘great tidal morass’ Airy omits to explain. If he had
studied Caesar’s description<a id="FNanchor_3035" href="#Footnote_3035" class="fnanchor">3035</a> of the much less formidable morass
over which his ablest marshal, Labienus, tried in vain to construct
a causeway, and from which he was obliged to retreat, he would
hardly have made Caesar attempt to cross ‘a great tidal morass’
in the face of an enemy.</p>

<p>Caesar, as we have seen, descried at daybreak, on his second
voyage, the coast of Britain ‘lying behind on the left’;<a id="FNanchor_3036" href="#Footnote_3036" class="fnanchor">3036</a> and if
these words mean, as all commentators except Airy and Professor
Ridgeway maintain, that he had drifted to some point east or north-east
of the South Foreland, they alone dispose of Airy’s theory. Airy
of course saw this; and accordingly he put his own construction
upon the passage. ‘I cannot conceive,’ he says,<a id="FNanchor_3037" href="#Footnote_3037" class="fnanchor">3037</a> ‘that the expression
refers to any direction but to that of the drift; it asserts that,
in reference to the direction of tidal current, the coast was on the
left hand. It is therefore indecisive as to place.’</p>

<p>Lewin, in his reply,<a id="FNanchor_3038" href="#Footnote_3038" class="fnanchor">3038</a> overlooked one consideration, which by
itself overthrows Airy’s interpretation. If, as Airy would have us
believe, Caesar’s vessel had not drifted as far east as Dover, she was,
owing to the direction of the current, moving parallel with the
British coast.<a id="FNanchor_3039" href="#Footnote_3039" class="fnanchor">3039</a> How, then, could Caesar, in the case supposed by
Airy, have said that he saw Britain ‘<i>lying behind</i> on the left’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub
sinistra relictam</i>)?</p>

<p>The theory that Caesar landed at Pevensey is irreconcilable with
the fact that the four chieftains who attacked his naval camp in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_617">617</span>
54 <small>B.C.</small> belonged not to Sussex but to Kent.<a id="FNanchor_3040" href="#Footnote_3040" class="fnanchor">3040</a> Airy endeavoured
to answer this objection by the remark that the men of Kent were
more numerous than those of Sussex, and would therefore have
gone to the assistance of their countrymen.<a id="FNanchor_3041" href="#Footnote_3041" class="fnanchor">3041</a> But, replied Lewin,<a id="FNanchor_3042" href="#Footnote_3042" class="fnanchor">3042</a>
‘as the men of Kent were distinct from the Regni, or men of Sussex,
the natural inference to be drawn from the assault of the camp by
the <i>men of Kent</i> surely is that the <i>camp was in Kent</i>.’ I may point
out further that, considering the state of internecine war in which
the Britons habitually lived, and which was only suspended for the
time under the pressure of a common danger,<a id="FNanchor_3043" href="#Footnote_3043" class="fnanchor">3043</a> it is not credible that
the men of Kent would have consented to make a long march away
from their own territory in order to undertake an operation which
would have properly devolved upon another tribe, and unlikely
that they would have been sufficiently well organized to feed their
army during a march of such duration.</p>

<p>The distance between the mouth of the Somme, which Airy
identifies with the Portus Itius, and St. Leonards, where he maintains
that Caesar first reached Britain, is, as he himself says,<a id="FNanchor_3044" href="#Footnote_3044" class="fnanchor">3044</a> ‘about
52 nautical miles,’ that is to say, rather more than 65 Roman miles:
the distance between the Portus Itius and Britain, according to
Caesar’s estimate,<a id="FNanchor_3045" href="#Footnote_3045" class="fnanchor">3045</a> was about 30 Roman miles. To say nothing of
this glaring discrepancy, Caesar’s account of his return voyage from
Britain to Gaul in 54 <small>B.C.</small> presents a difficulty which taxed all Airy’s
ingenuity to explain away. Caesar<a id="FNanchor_3046" href="#Footnote_3046" class="fnanchor">3046</a> tells us that he started in the
second watch in a dead calm (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summa tranquillitate</i>), and reached
Gaul at daybreak. Naturally the opponents of Airy’s theory insist
that to cross from Pevensey to the mouth of the Somme in this
time would have been impossible.</p>

<p>But Airy is never so confident as when he has to defend an untenable
position. He roundly asserts that his critics do not understand
Caesar’s language. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Summa tranquillitas</i>, he tells them, does not
mean ‘a dead calm’: it means ‘a stiff north-west wind’. Professor
Thompson, he informs us, assured him that a favourable wind ‘is
compatible with a “tranquillum mare”’; and he refers, in support
of this view, to a passage in one of Cicero’s letters,<a id="FNanchor_3047" href="#Footnote_3047" class="fnanchor">3047</a>&mdash;‘I am forced
to wait for fair weather owing to the open ships ... of the Rhodians’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nos Rhodiorum aphractis ceterisque longis navibus tranquillitates
aucupaturi eramus</i>). He also appeals to two passages in Vergil:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i12"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placidi straverunt aequora venti,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Creber et adspirans rursus vocat Auster in altum,</i><a id="FNanchor_3048" href="#Footnote_3048" class="fnanchor">3048</a></span>
</span></span>

and

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i18"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">postquam alta quierunt</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aequora, tendit iter velis portumque relinquit.</i><a id="FNanchor_3049" href="#Footnote_3049" class="fnanchor">3049</a></span>
</span></span>

‘It appears to me,’ he observes, ‘that Virgil’s idea of circumstances
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_618">618</span>
favourable to navigation always implied the co-existence of brisk
wind and smooth water.’ The idea that Caesar’s fleet was rowed
across the Channel he scouts as ridiculous. ‘If,’ he adds, ‘with
smooth water there had been a brisk breeze, the steerage would
have been good ... the voyage would have been easy ... we have
only to suppose a stiff north-west wind, capable of carrying the ships
7 or 8 miles an hour.’<a id="FNanchor_3050" href="#Footnote_3050" class="fnanchor">3050</a></p>

<p>Now as to the first of these passages, the context shows that
Cicero had been weatherbound by the violence of the trade winds;
and he uses the word <i>tranquillitates</i> in the sense of ‘fine weather’
in contrast with these.<a id="FNanchor_3051" href="#Footnote_3051" class="fnanchor">3051</a> His vessels were undecked; and therefore
he could not venture to set sail in a rough sea. It can hardly be
inferred from this passage, which Airy does not understand, that
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summa tranquillitas</i> means ‘a stiff north-west wind’. The first
passage quoted from Vergil simply says that gentle winds (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placidi
venti</i>&mdash;an expression by no means identical with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summa tranquillitas</i>)
stilled the sea, and that then a southerly wind invited Aeneas to
set sail: the second tells us that Aeneas set sail after the cessation
of a storm. If Cicero does not imply that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summa tranquillitas</i> means
‘a stiff north-west wind’, neither does Vergil. If Airy had really
known his authorities, he would have called to mind the passage in
which Cicero<a id="FNanchor_3052" href="#Footnote_3052" class="fnanchor">3052</a> relates, in language virtually identical with that of
Caesar, that he was prevented from sailing by ‘an astonishingly
dead calm’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mirae tranquillitates</i>). And if he had known his Caesar,
he would have thought of the passage<a id="FNanchor_3053" href="#Footnote_3053" class="fnanchor">3053</a> which tells how the ships of
the Veneti were becalmed in their fight with Decimus Brutus,&mdash;‘suddenly
there was a dead calm, and they could not stir’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tanta
subito malacia ac tranquillitas exstitit ut se ex loco commovere non
possent</i>). If <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tanta tranquillitas</i> means ‘such a dead calm’, as it
assuredly does, it is not easy to see how <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summa tranquillitas</i> can
mean ‘a stiff north-west wind’. If these passages do not fix the
meaning of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summa tranquillitas</i>, we may dispense with further
research.<a id="FNanchor_3054" href="#Footnote_3054" class="fnanchor">3054</a></p>

<p>I confess that I do not know whether more to admire the audacity
and resource which Airy displayed in controversy, or the sublime
lack of humour which permitted him to translate <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summa tranquillitas</i>
by ‘a stiff north-west wind’.</p>

<p>So much for the late Astronomer Royal. If I do not ignore the
arguments of Professor Ridgeway, it is because I am unwilling to
appear wanting in due respect for his reputation. But I would ask
him to explain one little difficulty which he has left unnoticed,&mdash;namely,
how Caesar’s cavalry transports could have contrived to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_619">619</span>
return, as, on his theory, they must have done, from a point near
Pevensey to Sangatte, that is to say, to steer E. 9° N. in the teeth
of a gale which unquestionably blew from some point east of north?
Let the professor consult any seafaring man, and he will learn that
such a feat would have been absolutely, absurdly impossible.</p>

<p>1. Professor Ridgeway labours to show that the distance of
Pevensey from Wissant corresponds with the distance, as stated by
Caesar, of Britain from the Portus Itius. He assures us that,
according to certain MSS. (which, however, he does not specify),
that distance was not ‘about thirty’, but ‘about forty miles’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circiter milium passuum XXXX....a continenti</i><a id="FNanchor_3055" href="#Footnote_3055" class="fnanchor">3055</a>).</p>

<p>It is surprising that so distinguished a scholar should have committed
himself to a statement which five minutes’ search in any
critical edition of the <cite>Commentaries</cite> would have shown to be unfounded.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">MSS.</i> to which he appeals have no existence; or,
if they exist, they have never come to light.<a id="FNanchor_3056" href="#Footnote_3056" class="fnanchor">3056</a> But, as I have already
shown, on other grounds,<a id="FNanchor_3057" href="#Footnote_3057" class="fnanchor">3057</a> Caesar <i>may</i> have written <i>XXXX</i>; so let
Professor Ridgeway have the benefit of the doubt, though I need
hardly say that the distance of Pevensey, and even of Bexhill, from
Wissant is much more than forty Roman miles.</p>

<p>2. The professor then invokes the authority of Dion Cassius.
‘If,’ he argues, ‘Caesar, on coming into the land of the Morini,
found, as Dio says, that all the landing places opposite the continent
were held by Britons, by which he evidently means the landing
places in the narrow part of the Channel, would Caesar obstinately
persist in crossing at the narrowest spot, or like a wise general seek
for a more suitable, although more distant landing place?’ This view,
he pleads, is supported by the fact that Caesar describes the passage
from the Portus Itius not as the shortest, but simply as the most
convenient (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">commodissimus</i>).<a id="FNanchor_3058" href="#Footnote_3058" class="fnanchor">3058</a></p>

<p>Mr. H. E. Malden makes the obvious reply that Caesar did not,
in point of fact, avoid the landing-places in question for the reason
suggested by Professor Ridgeway; for ‘he landed in the teeth of
a British army’.<a id="FNanchor_3059" href="#Footnote_3059" class="fnanchor">3059</a> Moreover, as we have already seen, Caesar tells
us that he sailed from the coast of the Morini ‘because the shortest
passage to Britain was from their country’.</p>

<p>3. The professor contends that his theory is supported by Caesar’s
account of his voyage in 54 <small>B.C.</small> Mr. Malden<a id="FNanchor_3060" href="#Footnote_3060" class="fnanchor">3060</a> told him that Caesar
could not have sailed from Wissant [or, as he ought to have said,
from Boulogne] to Pevensey with a south-west wind;<a id="FNanchor_3061" href="#Footnote_3061" class="fnanchor">3061</a> and that,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_620">620</span>
since the tide must have carried him in 54 <small>B.C.</small> at least as far as
the South Foreland,<a id="FNanchor_3062" href="#Footnote_3062" class="fnanchor">3062</a> it would have been impossible for his men to
row to Pevensey&mdash;a distance of fifty-five miles&mdash;between dawn and
noon, that is to say in less than nine hours. The professor replied
to the former objection that Caesar ‘evidently sailed, not direct
for Pevensey, but rather across Channel’.<a id="FNanchor_3063" href="#Footnote_3063" class="fnanchor">3063</a> The reply was as true
as it was futile; but it was true only because Caesar was bound,
not for Pevensey but for East Kent. Mr. Malden’s second objection
the professor endeavoured to rebut by the following arguments:&mdash;First,
that as Caesar’s men began to row at 3 a.m.,<a id="FNanchor_3064" href="#Footnote_3064" class="fnanchor">3064</a> continued rowing
till noon, and had the tide in their favour for the first six hours, they
could, if necessary, have rowed fifty-five miles in nine hours. Secondly,
that fifty-five miles is an excessive estimate; and that the actual
distance was not more than thirty-nine; for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accessum est ad Britanniam</i><a id="FNanchor_3065" href="#Footnote_3065" class="fnanchor">3065</a>
[the words by which Caesar describes the arrival of his fleet]
‘seems to denote nothing more than what he expressed by the words
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Britanniam attigit</i><a id="FNanchor_3066" href="#Footnote_3066" class="fnanchor">3066</a> in the story of the former voyage. But,’ continues
the professor, ‘he did not land at all at the place where he
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Britanniam attigit</i>, but dropped down with the tide seven miles
further. Moreover, Caesar does not say that he made for the very
spot where he had landed before, but simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">remis contendit ut eam
partem insulae caperet qua optimum esse egressum superiore aestate cognoverat</i><a id="FNanchor_3067" href="#Footnote_3067" class="fnanchor">3067</a>
[“rowed hard to gain the part of the island where, as he had
learned in the preceding summer, it was best to land”]. The high
cliffs formed his landmark.’ The professor is presumably referring
to the cliffs eight miles east of Pevensey, which, as Airy points out,
are ‘from ten to thirty feet high’: these cliffs would evidently
have made a most conspicuous ‘landmark’. However, the professor
contrives to reduce the length of the voyage by eight miles at
one end: he curtails it at the other by simply denying, like Airy,
that when Caesar ‘saw Britain lying behind on the left’, he had
drifted past the South Foreland. He insists that Caesar ‘might
use the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">relictam</i> [‘left behind’] when, instead of finding
himself close to the shore of Britain, he discovered that, between
the course he had sailed and the way he had drifted, he had moved
away from Britain’.<a id="FNanchor_3068" href="#Footnote_3068" class="fnanchor">3068</a> This remark only shows that the professor
did not know what was the direction of the flood tide. Unless
Caesar had got past the South Foreland by the time when he ‘saw
Britain lying behind on the left’, the tide had not carried him ‘away
from Britain’.</p>

<p>The professor’s argument comes to this. He says that Caesar’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_621">621</span>
men rowed as hard as they could; that they could have rowed
fifty-five miles in nine hours, but that they only did row thirty-nine!
He asks us to believe that they rowed fifty-five miles in nine hours,
though, on his own showing, the tide was against them for one-third
of that time!<a id="FNanchor_3069" href="#Footnote_3069" class="fnanchor">3069</a> Finally, when he argues that because Caesar did not
land in 55 <small>B.C.</small> at the point where he <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Britanniam attigit</i>, therefore
he did not land in 54 <small>B.C.</small> at the point where <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accessum est ad Britanniam</i>,
he forgets two things:&mdash;first, that Caesar distinctly says that
in 55 <small>B.C.</small> he sailed on seven miles from the point where he first
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Britanniam attigit</i>, whereas all commentators except Professor
Ridgeway have drawn from Caesar’s narrative the inevitable
inference that in 54 <small>B.C.</small> he landed at the point where <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accessum est
ad Britanniam</i>; secondly, that the Britons expected him to land
in 54 <small>B.C.</small> at the point where <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accessum est ad Britanniam</i>, for ‘large
forces had assembled there’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnae manus eo convenissent</i>). Does
the professor seriously mean to argue that if Caesar had landed
elsewhere, he would not have said so?<a id="FNanchor_3070" href="#Footnote_3070" class="fnanchor">3070</a></p>

<p>Not a single argument of the least weight has been or can be
adduced to show that Caesar landed at Pevensey or anywhere on
the coast of Sussex.<a id="FNanchor_3071" href="#Footnote_3071" class="fnanchor">3071</a> On the other hand, there is not a single
objection which has here been brought against that theory which
is not alone sufficient to overthrow it. The truth is that Airy, with
all his scientific knowledge and controversial skill, was not adequately
equipped to discuss the question: his classical scholarship left
much to be desired; and, having once committed himself to the
preposterous theory that the Portus Itius was in the estuary of the
Somme, he was forced to look for Caesar’s landing-place far to the
west of that part of Britain in which Caesar’s narrative inevitably
places it. To that part of Britain our inquiry must henceforth be
confined. Whether Caesar landed east or west of the cliffs of Dover,
he landed in Kent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_622">622</span></p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg622">VIII. THE THEORY THAT CAESAR LANDED AT
LYMPNE OR HYTHE</h3>

<p>The most dexterous advocate of the theory that Caesar landed on
Romney Marsh was Thomas Lewin; and it says a great deal for his
persuasiveness that not one of his critics appears to have detected
the inconsistencies with which his work abounds. Those which
vitiate his argument, in so far as it relates to the tides, I have mentioned
already.<a id="FNanchor_3072" href="#Footnote_3072" class="fnanchor">3072</a> The rest all spring from one and the same source.
When Lewin wrote his book, he adopted a theory as to the configuration
of Romney Marsh which, after obtaining what he considered
‘more accurate information’,<a id="FNanchor_3073" href="#Footnote_3073" class="fnanchor">3073</a> he discarded. This information he
embodied in an appendix to his second edition; but at the same
time he allowed the statements based upon his former researches
to stand. Thus on page 65, note 4, he implies that ‘the heart of the
marsh’ was inhabited; but in his preface (pages v-vi) he affirms
that ‘the eastern end of the Marsh where Caesar arrived was as
much <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</i> in his day as in our own’, virtually admitting, as
the context and the map which faces page liii alike show, that the
rest was inundated at every high tide. On page 92 he says that
‘the sea, as is proved incontestably by the fragments of ships and
anchors which have been dug up, flowed to the very base of the hill,
and formed there the port of Limne. Stutfall [castle], therefore,
was formed for the protection of the shipping.’ On pages lxviii and
lxix the incontestable proof is not only contested but flung to the
winds: ‘the fragments of ships and anchors’ are silently annihilated;
Stutfall Castle, it now appears, ‘was for the protection, not of the
port, but of Saxonicum littus’; and the ‘Portus Limanis’ (<i>sic</i>)
becomes a ‘narrow gut’, extending from a point near Shorncliffe
to West Hythe behind a bank of shingle broken by a narrow entrance
nearly opposite Hythe. In an article which Lewin contributed to
the fortieth volume of <cite>Archaeologia</cite> he remarks that if the Portus
Lemanis had been at the foot of Lympne Hill, ‘we should expect
to find some vestiges, however faint, of the port itself’: but, he
adds, ‘I have never heard or read (though I have often inquired)
that any remnant of a pier or sunken vessel, or even any anchor or
other part of a ship’s tackle, was ever discovered in this part.’<a id="FNanchor_3074" href="#Footnote_3074" class="fnanchor">3074</a> Are
we to infer, then, Mr. Lewin, that when you told us on page 92 of
your book that ‘fragments of ships and anchors’ had been ‘dug up’
at the foot of the hill, you were romancing? On turning back to
page 42, we find that the above-mentioned ‘narrow gut’ first came
into existence in the time of the Saxons; but on page lxix we learn
with bewilderment that it ‘must have continued such until the
abandonment of Britain by the Romans or nearly so’. In the
article which he contributed to <cite>Archaeologia</cite> Lewin changed his
mind again. In the map which illustrates this article the ‘narrow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_623">623</span>
gut’ extends no further westward than Hythe. On page 44 of the
book we read that Caesar landed on ‘the western side’ of ‘the
creek of Limne’ or ‘port of Limne’, the very existence of which
the author’s later and ‘more accurate information’ led him to
deny. On pages lxxii and lxxiv Caesar’s landing-place is silently
transferred from ‘the western side’ of ‘the creek of Limne’ to
Hythe. On page 44 two islands mentioned (according to Lewin)
by Valerius Maximus are identified with ‘two islands’ depicted on
‘old maps’ of ‘the bay of Limne’: on page lxxiii we are asked to
identify them with two ‘islands’ in the ‘narrow gut’ above
mentioned.</p>

<p>The reader now understands that, according to the theory of the
ancient configuration of Romney Marsh which Lewin adopted in
his Appendix and illustrated in the map facing page liii of his book,
it would have been impossible for Caesar to land opposite Lympne,
because on that theory the marsh between Lympne Hill and the
shingle beach was flooded by the sea at high tide. Nevertheless,
I shall consider the arguments by which Lewin defended his original
view&mdash;that Caesar landed opposite Lympne&mdash;because distinguished
scholars still hold that there was a harbour there in Roman times.</p>

<p>When we come to examine Lewin’s final view&mdash;that Caesar landed
at Hythe&mdash;we shall find some difficulty in doing justice to it; for
he carefully avoids committing himself to any clear explanation of
his meaning. If we look at his map<a id="FNanchor_3075" href="#Footnote_3075" class="fnanchor">3075</a> of the ‘narrow gut’, which
he believed to have extended from West Hythe to a point opposite
Shorncliffe, we shall see that, on his theory, Caesar must have done
one of two things. Either he must have landed on the shingle west
of the mouth of the gut, or he must have landed on the shingle
east of that mouth; for Lewin clearly gives us to understand that
the Roman ships did not sail into the harbour.<a id="FNanchor_3076" href="#Footnote_3076" class="fnanchor">3076</a> He maintains that
on the day on which the first landing occurred a fierce struggle took
place between the Romans and the Britons in ‘the field south of
Hythe’.<a id="FNanchor_3077" href="#Footnote_3077" class="fnanchor">3077</a> In order to reach this field, the Romans would have had
to walk along the shingle either westward or eastward, and then
along the northern shore of the ‘narrow gut’. But Caesar distinctly
states that as soon as the Romans stood on dry land, that is
to say, on Lewin’s own showing, on the shingle beach, they put the
Britons to flight.<a id="FNanchor_3078" href="#Footnote_3078" class="fnanchor">3078</a> What becomes, then, of the imaginary combat
in ‘the field south of Hythe’? Furthermore, Lewin, while he is
constrained to admit that this field is ‘below high-water mark’,
assures us that it was ‘certainly dry at low water’.<a id="FNanchor_3079" href="#Footnote_3079" class="fnanchor">3079</a> But he himself
strenuously maintains that the Romans <i>began</i> to land three hours
after low tide.<a id="FNanchor_3080" href="#Footnote_3080" class="fnanchor">3080</a> Perhaps he was uneasily conscious that he had
contradicted himself when he suggested that the Britons ‘would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_624">624</span>
unquestionably have possessed the skill to embank the port and
drain the land in the immediate neighbourhood’.<a id="FNanchor_3081" href="#Footnote_3081" class="fnanchor">3081</a></p>

<p>The theory that Caesar landed at or near Hythe involves another
mystery, which Lewin does not attempt to clear up. Where was
the camp which, in 54 <small>B.C.</small>, Caesar linked by ‘a single defensive
work’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">una munitione</i><a id="FNanchor_3082" href="#Footnote_3082" class="fnanchor">3082</a>) with the ships which he found it necessary
to haul up on dry land, and how was the defensive work constructed?
Lewin tells us that the ships could not possibly have been drawn
up opposite Shorncliffe, because the shore there ‘is rocky and
precipitous’.<a id="FNanchor_3083" href="#Footnote_3083" class="fnanchor">3083</a> Therefore, if the landing took place near Hythe,
they must have been drawn up on the beach west of Shorncliffe, and
on the seaward side of the ‘narrow gut’,&mdash;as he suggests, opposite
Hythe. If so, of what was the ‘defensive work’ composed? Surely
not of shingle? The entrenchments which a child constructs with
his toy spade at Margate would have been just as effective. But
if not of shingle, what other material was available on a shingle
beach? And what was the direction of the ‘defensive work’ which
connected the ships with the camp? Presumably the camp was
on dry land behind the ‘narrow gut’, and constructed not of shingle
but of earth. Now the entrenchment which protected the ships
and connected them with this camp could hardly have been carried
across the ‘narrow gut’, which was deeply submerged at every
high tide! I can only suppose, then, that the connecting work was
really constructed, by some occult process, of shingle; traced out
along the shingle beach either eastward towards Shorncliffe, or
westward to West Hythe Oaks, and then along the northern shore
of the ‘narrow gut’ until it joined the camp. Or if, as Lewin
suggests, the camp with which the ships were connected was distinct
from the camp which Caesar marked out on an ‘advantageous
position’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loco idoneo</i><a id="FNanchor_3084" href="#Footnote_3084" class="fnanchor">3084</a>) immediately after his second landing; and
if, as he affirms,<a id="FNanchor_3085" href="#Footnote_3085" class="fnanchor">3085</a> it ‘must have stood upon the seashore’, and its
site ‘must long since have disappeared’; then it can only be concluded
that camp and connecting work were both constructed of
shingle!</p>

<p>Again, it is incredible that a gale which drove some of Caesar’s
eighteen cavalry transports past Hythe or Lympne to a more westerly
part of the island should have carried the rest back to the port from
which they had started, which Lewin rightly identified with Ambleteuse.
If the ships had been approaching Hythe when the storm
arose, they would have been obliged, in order to return to Ambleteuse,
to steer SE. by E. 9° S.<a id="FNanchor_3086" href="#Footnote_3086" class="fnanchor">3086</a> Now Lewin himself maintains that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_625">625</span>
the gale blew from the north-east.<a id="FNanchor_3087" href="#Footnote_3087" class="fnanchor">3087</a> As a matter of fact, if it had
blown from this quarter at Lympne or Hythe, it would have been
practically innocuous; for off either of those places vessels would
have been sheltered from it by the hills, and the transports which
were driven westward would not have been, as they were, swept by
the waves: if the gale had blown from the north-east off Walmer,
its direction off Hythe would have been about east-north-east.<a id="FNanchor_3088" href="#Footnote_3088" class="fnanchor">3088</a>
Still, for the sake of argument, I will accept Lewin’s view. According
to it, the ships would have been forced to sail within less than eight
points of the wind. But in a heavy gale a ship will make as much
as six points and a half of lee-way.<a id="FNanchor_3089" href="#Footnote_3089" class="fnanchor">3089</a> Let us reduce this estimate to
four, which is certainly a liberal reduction.<a id="FNanchor_3090" href="#Footnote_3090" class="fnanchor">3090</a> It follows that the hapless
transports would have been required, in order to reach their
destination, to lie within less than four points of the wind, a feat
which, I need hardly say, would have been utterly impossible.<a id="FNanchor_3091" href="#Footnote_3091" class="fnanchor">3091</a>
Furthermore, Lewin affirms, in an unguarded moment, that the
gale, when a few hours later it wrecked Caesar’s ships as they rode
at anchor, was still blowing from the north-east: but he does not
explain how a north-easterly gale could have driven ashore, that is
to say, driven in a northerly direction, ships anchored off Lympne
or Hythe!</p>

<p>Such are a few of the absurdities in which Lewin’s theory plunges
him. However, he shall be heard in his own defence.</p>

<p>The argument upon which Lewin lays the most stress has been
already refuted.<a id="FNanchor_3092" href="#Footnote_3092" class="fnanchor">3092</a> He maintains that at the time when Caesar, on
the day of his first voyage, quitted his anchorage and sailed with
the stream to the spot where he was to land, the stream must have
been running down the Channel.<a id="FNanchor_3093" href="#Footnote_3093" class="fnanchor">3093</a> Let us assume, in order to allow
more than its due weight to his argument, that Caesar must have
weighed anchor as early as 3.30 p.m.,<a id="FNanchor_3094" href="#Footnote_3094" class="fnanchor">3094</a> though I shall afterwards
prove that the assumption is both unnecessary and false; and let
us also suppose that the tide did not actually turn eastward until
after 5 p.m. Even then, unless Caesar could have calculated the
exact time which it had still to run with more than the certainty of the
experts who prepare the <cite>Admiralty Tide Tables</cite>, he would have had
to face the risk that, before he could reach his landing-place, it might
turn against him. Even if Heller<a id="FNanchor_3095" href="#Footnote_3095" class="fnanchor">3095</a> is not right in interpreting the
words ‘getting wind and tide simultaneously in his favour’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et
ventum et aestum uno tempore nactus secundum</i>) as meaning that
Caesar weighed anchor just after the stream had turned, there can
be no doubt that this would have been the wisest course to pursue.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_626">626</span></p>

<p>1. Having disposed, to his own satisfaction, of the question of
the tides, Lewin remarks that ‘Hythe would be much nearer than
Deal, and was the natural port for vessels from Boulogne’.<a id="FNanchor_3096" href="#Footnote_3096" class="fnanchor">3096</a></p>

<p>Yes, nearer by a bare two miles, and a few yards nearer than
Walmer! But, as Lewin himself insists,<a id="FNanchor_3097" href="#Footnote_3097" class="fnanchor">3097</a> Caesar, when he sailed
from Boulogne, did not intend to land either at Hythe or at Deal;
and unless he intended to sail direct to one of those places, Lewin’s
argument collapses. Moreover, since the greater part of the voyage
was made upon the easterly-going stream, it would have taken
longer to sail to Hythe than to the coast between Walmer and Deal.
And when Lewin affirms that Hythe ‘was the natural port for
vessels from Boulogne’, he apparently forgets that he has already
told us that ‘Folkestone ... would be the natural port for Boulogne’,<a id="FNanchor_3098" href="#Footnote_3098" class="fnanchor">3098</a>
that Caesar’s fleet never entered Hythe harbour, and that ‘the
mooring of the Roman vessels within it would be certain destruction’.<a id="FNanchor_3099" href="#Footnote_3099" class="fnanchor">3099</a></p>

<p>2. Lewin attempts to show that the wind which carried Caesar
from Boulogne to his anchorage on his first voyage, and which
would, if it had continued, have been in his favour if he had intended
to sail on towards Deal, veered round before he quitted his anchorage.<a id="FNanchor_3100" href="#Footnote_3100" class="fnanchor">3100</a>
His argument runs as follows:&mdash;‘Caesar says that he started from
his anchorage ... having <i>got</i> the wind in his favour, and the Latin
word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nactus</i> implies that the wind had undergone a change.... When
he embarked at Boulogne he despatched the cavalry to Ambleteuse ... with
orders to follow him with all haste; but ... they did not
leave that haven for Britain until the fourth day after,<a id="FNanchor_3101" href="#Footnote_3101" class="fnanchor">3101</a> and no
plausible reason can be given for this except that, for the whole
of this interval, the wind was contrary; that is ... had shifted.’
In a later passage<a id="FNanchor_3102" href="#Footnote_3102" class="fnanchor">3102</a> he maintains that if the wind had not shifted
during the voyage, the length of the passage, and especially the
tardy arrival of the transports, would be inexplicable. Moreover,
he says, the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nactus</i> ‘implies a change either in the <i>wind</i> or
the tide: the tide had not changed, and therefore the change alluded
to must have been in the wind’.<a id="FNanchor_3103" href="#Footnote_3103" class="fnanchor">3103</a> While, however, he argues that
the wind must have shifted, he endeavours to secure his retreat by
affirming that, if it had not shifted, Caesar could nevertheless have
sailed to Hythe as easily as to Deal. ‘Supposing,’ he says,<a id="FNanchor_3104" href="#Footnote_3104" class="fnanchor">3104</a> ‘the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_627">627</span>
wind to have blown from the south, it would have been favourable
to a movement, from a point opposite Dover, either to the east or
west.’</p>

<p>I freely admit&mdash;indeed I have myself maintained&mdash;that the wind
had shifted during the voyage. It had shifted to a point unfavourable,
or comparatively unfavourable, to ships sailing from North-Eastern
Gaul to Britain. I also, like Lewin, maintain that it shifted
again before Caesar quitted his anchorage. The fact is obvious.
But what then? How can Lewin prove that before Caesar quitted
his anchorage the wind did not shift to a quarter which would have
been favourable to a run from a point off the cliffs of Dover towards
Deal? Moreover, it is not true that if the wind had ‘blown from
the south, it would have been favourable to a movement, from
a point opposite Dover, either to the east or west’. If the wind had
blown exactly from the south, it would certainly not have been
called favourable to a movement from a point opposite Dover to
Hythe, that is to say, within less than seven points of the wind; and
if the wind had blown from any point west of south, the word
‘favourable’ would have been still less appropriate.<a id="FNanchor_3105" href="#Footnote_3105" class="fnanchor">3105</a></p>

<p>3. Lewin maintains that the wisest course which Caesar could have
pursued when he sailed on from his anchorage in 55 <small>B.C.</small> would have
been to steer westward. ‘Let us first consider,’ he says,<a id="FNanchor_3106" href="#Footnote_3106" class="fnanchor">3106</a> ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>,
what a prudent commander might be expected to do under similar
circumstances.... To the right he would see the precipitous chalk
cliffs stretching away ... till they terminated at the South Foreland.... The
lowlands about Walmer and Deal would not be visible; and
it is at least doubtful whether Volusenus had included them in his
survey ... tracing the line of cliffs westward, he could not fail to
see that they terminated at Sandgate, and that a broad level plain
there succeeded.’ At Hythe, he adds, there was a landing-place
‘distinctly visible from his moorings’.<a id="FNanchor_3107" href="#Footnote_3107" class="fnanchor">3107</a></p>

<p>This argument rests upon the absolutely groundless assumption
that Volusenus had not reconnoitred the coast on the north of the
South Foreland;<a id="FNanchor_3108" href="#Footnote_3108" class="fnanchor">3108</a> in other words, that Volusenus, whom Caesar
specially selected as a thoroughly competent man, had grossly
neglected his duty and disobeyed his instructions. Besides, even
if the landing-place at Hythe had been ‘distinctly visible’ from
Caesar’s moorings,<a id="FNanchor_3109" href="#Footnote_3109" class="fnanchor">3109</a> nothing would have been gained; for Caesar
acted, not upon what he could see, but, as he tells us himself,<a id="FNanchor_3110" href="#Footnote_3110" class="fnanchor">3110</a> upon
what he had learned from the report of Volusenus. Whether he
could or could not see ‘from his moorings’ the place where he was
to land, he knew the direction in which he intended to sail. Finally,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_628">628</span>
when Lewin considers ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>’ that ‘a prudent commander might
be expected under similar circumstances’ to land at Hythe or
Lympne, he only advertises his own ignorance of a commander’s
business. As I shall show presently,<a id="FNanchor_3111" href="#Footnote_3111" class="fnanchor">3111</a> no commander who was not
hopelessly incompetent would have dreamed, in the circumstances
of ancient warfare, of attempting to land either at Hythe or at
Lympne.</p>

<p>4. Lewin contends in his text that at Lympne and in his appendix
that at Hythe there was a landing-place which exactly corresponded
with Caesar’s description; and he denies that any such landing-place
exists at Deal. He affirms<a id="FNanchor_3112" href="#Footnote_3112" class="fnanchor">3112</a> that the shore on the western
side of ‘the creek of Lympne’ was ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apertum</i> or open, for the heights
to the north were at least a mile distant. The sea-beach was also
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">molle</i> or soft ... in a sailor’s sense, <i>i.e.</i> it consisted of shingle, than
which nothing can be more favourable to the security of vessels.... Sand,
on the contrary, is, in naval phraseology, of the hardest kind,
as it has no “give”, and a ship beating against it would soon be
dashed to pieces.’ He says that, according to Lucan,<a id="FNanchor_3113" href="#Footnote_3113" class="fnanchor">3113</a> Plutarch,<a id="FNanchor_3114" href="#Footnote_3114" class="fnanchor">3114</a>
and Dion Cassius,<a id="FNanchor_3115" href="#Footnote_3115" class="fnanchor">3115</a> there was ‘marshy ground’ at the place where
Caesar landed, and he assures us that marshes were formed by the
streams which entered the port of Hythe.<a id="FNanchor_3116" href="#Footnote_3116" class="fnanchor">3116</a> He remarks that,
according to Valerius Maximus,<a id="FNanchor_3117" href="#Footnote_3117" class="fnanchor">3117</a> there were two small islands near
the landing-place, which were the scene of an exploit performed by
one of Caesar’s centurions: ‘on looking,’ he says, ‘at the old maps
of this part of the coast, I find ... that the bay of Limne contained ... two
islands.’ Like other people who had learned to measure
the trustworthiness of Valerius Maximus, Lewin had himself been
sceptical about the anecdote of the centurion; but how could he
resist the testimony of the ‘old maps’? He admits that he was
converted:&mdash;‘the circumstance, so apocryphal before, becomes thus
no inconsiderable argument for placing the descent in this locality.’<a id="FNanchor_3118" href="#Footnote_3118" class="fnanchor">3118</a>
Afterwards he changes his mind, and transfers the islands some
distance to the east of Lympne. They actually existed, he tells us,
a few years before the publication of his book, ‘either near to or in
the ancient port of Hythe’; they also are depicted in various old
maps; and they were ‘carted away’ by the late James Elliott,
the engineer of Romney Marsh.<a id="FNanchor_3119" href="#Footnote_3119" class="fnanchor">3119</a> Furthermore, he assures us<a id="FNanchor_3120" href="#Footnote_3120" class="fnanchor">3120</a> that
the incident described by Valerius Maximus is also noticed by
Plutarch,<a id="FNanchor_3121" href="#Footnote_3121" class="fnanchor">3121</a> who ‘lays the scene in sight of Caesar himself, and
therefore close to the camp; and in a marsh or swamp, which, with
the light afforded by the account of Valerius, must be taken to mean
a lagoon subject to the alternations of the high and low tides’.</p>

<p>Now as to the exact meaning of the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apertum</i> in the passage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_629">629</span>
to which Lewin refers, the commentators are not agreed. While
he insists that the beach on which he believes Caesar to have landed
was ‘open’, because ‘the heights to the north were at least a mile
distant’, Dr. Guest<a id="FNanchor_3122" href="#Footnote_3122" class="fnanchor">3122</a> denies that they were ‘open’, because ‘there
is a range of heights at no great distance’. According to Long,<a id="FNanchor_3123" href="#Footnote_3123" class="fnanchor">3123</a>
‘“open” means that from the beach he could see into the country.’
Now any one who has read the <cite>Commentaries</cite> attentively will see
that all these explanations are wrong. For in his narrative of the
second expedition<a id="FNanchor_3124" href="#Footnote_3124" class="fnanchor">3124</a> Caesar tells us that he ‘felt little anxiety for
the ships, as he was leaving them at anchor on a nice open shore’<a id="FNanchor_3125" href="#Footnote_3125" class="fnanchor">3125</a>
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo minus veritus navibus, quod in litore molli atque aperto deligatas
ad ancoras relinquebat</i>). If the explanations which I have quoted
were correct, the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apertum</i> in this passage would be irrelevant.
Whether the ‘heights’ were ‘at no great distance’, or ‘from the
beach Caesar could see into the country’, the security of the ships
would not have been affected in the slightest degree. The word
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apertum</i> does not describe the country near the shore: it describes
the shore itself; and, as C. Schneider<a id="FNanchor_3126" href="#Footnote_3126" class="fnanchor">3126</a> says, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apertum litus</i> means
a shore free from such obstacles or dangers as rocks, boulders, and
the like.<a id="FNanchor_3127" href="#Footnote_3127" class="fnanchor">3127</a> But, even assuming that Lewin was right in his interpretation
of the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apertum</i>, this much is certain:&mdash;the existence
of the heights to which he refers is alone sufficient to prove that
Caesar did not land either at Lympne or at Hythe or at any point
between those two places. This is a matter on which I confidently
appeal to any military expert who has studied the records of ancient
warfare. Caesar might no doubt have <i>landed</i> at Hythe without
any extraordinary difficulty; but if he had been so foolish as to
land there, he would have found that his difficulties were only
beginning. Never, even when fighting against an uncivilized enemy,
did he attempt to force his way up a hill if it was possible to avoid
doing so.<a id="FNanchor_3128" href="#Footnote_3128" class="fnanchor">3128</a> If he had landed either at Lympne or at Hythe, he could
not have turned the line of heights which extends behind those two
places: he could not have penetrated into the interior of the country
unless he had passed them; and he could not have passed them
except at a cost of life which the least experienced of his officers
would have been too prudent to incur. Furthermore, however
‘open’ the country may have been on the western side of ‘the
[imaginary] creek of Lympne’, he could not have landed there if,
as Lewin admits,<a id="FNanchor_3129" href="#Footnote_3129" class="fnanchor">3129</a> the country was under water at high tide.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_630">630</span></p>

<p>The argument which Lewin bases upon the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mollis</i> has no
value; for he does not fully understand the meaning of the word.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mollis</i>, in the passage which we are considering, simply means that
the shore was one where the anchorage was good, and where the
ships, if they were driven aground, would suffer comparatively
little:<a id="FNanchor_3130" href="#Footnote_3130" class="fnanchor">3130</a> it probably also implies that the shore was gently sloping.<a id="FNanchor_3131" href="#Footnote_3131" class="fnanchor">3131</a>
Moreover, even if the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mollis</i> implied that the shore on which
Caesar landed was composed of shingle, Lewin would not be justified
in concluding that Caesar landed at Hythe or Lympne unless he
could prove that no other shingle beach in Kent satisfied the requirements
of Caesar’s narrative.</p>

<p>The statements of Lucan, Valerius Maximus, Plutarch, and Dion
Cassius, upon which Lewin lays so much stress, are not really evidence
at all; and if he had been a classical scholar, he would never have
quoted them. Nor, indeed, was his scholarship sufficient to enable
him to understand what they meant. The passage quoted from
Lucan occurs in a rhetorical speech which he puts into the mouth
of Pompey:&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i8"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rheni gelidis quod fugit ab undis</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oceanumque vocans incerti stagna profundi</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Territa quaesitis ostendit terga Britannis.</i></span>
</span></span>

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stagna</i> of course simply denotes the English Channel, about which
Lucan’s ideas were vague; and the point of the line is the
suggestion that Caesar, in order to magnify the difficulties of
his expedition, mendaciously described ‘the pools of a shifting
sea’ as an ocean.<a id="FNanchor_3132" href="#Footnote_3132" class="fnanchor">3132</a> As to Valerius Maximus, the idea of going
to his collection of anecdotes for the details of Caesar’s military
operations is really funny;<a id="FNanchor_3133" href="#Footnote_3133" class="fnanchor">3133</a> but if he is to be counted an
authority, he does not support Lewin’s theory, but overthrows it.<a id="FNanchor_3134" href="#Footnote_3134" class="fnanchor">3134</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_631">631</span>
Lewin<a id="FNanchor_3135" href="#Footnote_3135" class="fnanchor">3135</a> insists that ‘the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vada</i> described by Valerius Maximus as
caused by the flux and reflux of the tide are evidently the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vada</i>
referred to by Caesar (iv, 26)’. Now ‘the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vada</i> referred to by
Caesar’ were the shallow places of the shore on which he landed;
and ‘the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vada</i> described by Valerius Maximus’ were, according
to Lewin’s final view, in Hythe harbour. Yet Lewin emphatically
denies that Caesar landed in Hythe harbour! Furthermore,
Lewin assures us that the ‘islands’ of which Valerius Maximus
speaks were composed of earth, and have been ‘carted away’.
But Valerius Maximus says nothing about islands: the only
island which he mentions is Britain. As to the marshes, Heller<a id="FNanchor_3136" href="#Footnote_3136" class="fnanchor">3136</a>
points out that Lewin is wrong in concluding from the narratives
of Plutarch and Dion that the coast on which Caesar landed was
marshy. Dion’s word τενάγη is simply his translation of Caesar’s
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vada</i>, and means not ‘marshes’ but ‘shallows’.<a id="FNanchor_3137" href="#Footnote_3137" class="fnanchor">3137</a> Plutarch, as the
words εἰς τόπον ἑλώδη καὶ μεστὸν ὑδάτων (‘into a marshy place
full of water’), which are explained by the following words ῥεύματα
τελματώδη (‘marshy [or muddy] streams’), clearly show, was not
speaking of a combat on the seashore, but of one which took place
inland; and when Lewin identifies Plutarch’s ῥεύματα τελματώδη
with Dion’s τενάγη, he simply exposes his own ignorance of Greek.
Moreover, Plutarch is so deficient in accuracy and precision that his
description of an incident of this kind is useless for the purpose of
topographical identification.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, no evidence that there was any marshy ground
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_632">632</span>
at or near Caesar’s landing-place; and if there was, the fact does
not prove that he landed at Hythe.<a id="FNanchor_3138" href="#Footnote_3138" class="fnanchor">3138</a></p>

<p>5. Lewin<a id="FNanchor_3139" href="#Footnote_3139" class="fnanchor">3139</a> next proceeds to examine Caesar’s narrative of the
events which followed his first disembarkation,&mdash;the hauling up of
the galleys on dry land, the wreck caused by the storm which
occurred on the night of the full moon, and the subsequent attack
by the British charioteers. The whole account, he tells us, corresponds
with the topography of Lympne and Hythe, but of no other
place. The shingle field between Dymchurch Wall and Shorncliffe,
being ‘sound and dry, without any mixture of ooze’, deserves
Caesar’s epithet, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aridum</i>:<a id="FNanchor_3140" href="#Footnote_3140" class="fnanchor">3140</a> the ‘steep place’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">declivis ac praeceps
locus</i><a id="FNanchor_3141" href="#Footnote_3141" class="fnanchor">3141</a>), down which the British chariots charged, is ‘in this part
of the marsh on the north’; the spring tide, driven by ‘a strong
south-east wind’, would have poured over the shingle, and waterlogged
Caesar’s galleys. ‘It is a singular confirmation,’ says Lewin,
‘of our hypothesis of the debarcation at Romney Marsh that the
range of high water is greater here than at any other point of the
southern coast. At Dungeness, for example, the mean range is
twenty-one feet three quarters, while at Deal it is only sixteen feet.’
Finally, he anticipates the objection that if Caesar had landed near
Hythe, he would have moored his ships within Hythe harbour, and
thereby avoided the destruction which overtook so many of them.
He explains that ‘the narrow and winding gut which constituted
the port’ was ‘little capable of receiving a fleet’, and that, ‘as it ... could
only be entered and quitted at high water, and as its banks
were lined by a hostile population, the mooring of the Roman
vessels within it would be certain destruction,’ but ‘it would be
highly useful for keeping up his communication with the Continent’.</p>

<p>That Caesar’s ships could have been hauled up on the shingle
between Dymchurch Wall and Shorncliffe; that the said shingle
might have been described as ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aridum</i>’; that a ‘steep place’ existed
‘in this part of the marsh on the north’;<a id="FNanchor_3142" href="#Footnote_3142" class="fnanchor">3142</a> and that the tide, driven
by ‘a strong south-easterly wind’, might have waterlogged Caesar’s
ships if they had been drawn up on the beach at Hythe,&mdash;all these
things may be admitted: but they avail nothing to establish Lewin’s
theory unless he can prove that on the east coast of Kent there
was no place which answered equally well to Caesar’s narrative;
and it is amusing to find that in another passage<a id="FNanchor_3143" href="#Footnote_3143" class="fnanchor">3143</a> he rightly insists
that the wind which he here calls ‘south-easterly’ was ‘from the
north-east’. The comparison which he makes between ‘the range
of high water’ at Romney Marsh and at Deal is irrelevant; for
I doubt whether he would have seriously maintained that a spring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_633">633</span>
tide between Walmer and Deal, heightened by a storm, would have
been insufficient to cause the damage which Caesar described.</p>

<p>The objection which Lewin anticipates, and waves aside, is not
thereby disposed of. If the reader will examine Lewin’s map, he
will see that Hythe harbour would have been amply large enough
to accommodate Caesar’s fleet;<a id="FNanchor_3144" href="#Footnote_3144" class="fnanchor">3144</a> and if it could only be entered at
high water, the Portus Itius, according to Lewin himself,<a id="FNanchor_3145" href="#Footnote_3145" class="fnanchor">3145</a> was in
the same case. That Caesar would have landed close to a harbour
which he afterwards found ‘highly useful’, without mentioning its
existence, is, to say the least, unlikely. Moreover, Lewin omits to
tell us in what respect Caesar could have found a harbour ‘highly
useful’ even for ‘keeping up his communication with the Continent’,
if the dispatch vessels which kept up the communication never
entered the harbour; nor does he explain what would have been the
use of their entering the harbour when, on his own showing, they
could not have remained there without ‘certain destruction’, but
after they had entered it, must have forthwith gone out again, and
have been hauled up on the beach outside along with the others.</p>

<p>6. It remained for Lewin to point out the spot on the banks of
a river about twelve miles from the Roman camp, where the Britons
disputed Caesar’s advance on the day after his second landing in
Britain. He maintained that Wye on the Stour, between Ashford
and Canterbury, answered in every detail to Caesar’s account, and
denied that any such place could be found on the theory that Caesar
landed near Deal.<a id="FNanchor_3146" href="#Footnote_3146" class="fnanchor">3146</a></p>

<p>Airy<a id="FNanchor_3147" href="#Footnote_3147" class="fnanchor">3147</a> objects that the Stour at Wye is ‘little wider than a wide
ditch’, and that, as it flows ‘between sound meadows, where there
is not, and never has been, any marsh or broad stream’, it never
could have been wider. Lewin<a id="FNanchor_3148" href="#Footnote_3148" class="fnanchor">3148</a> replies that he has himself seen
the Stour at Wye when it was so full of water that ‘the mill had
constantly at work four pairs of stones from 5.30 a.m. till 8 p.m.,
except for a short time at noon’; and I may add that it is more than
ten yards wide.<a id="FNanchor_3149" href="#Footnote_3149" class="fnanchor">3149</a> Caesar does not describe the stream at all: he
merely calls it a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flumen</i>; and he calls the Oze and the Ozerain, the
two streams which encompass Alesia<a id="FNanchor_3150" href="#Footnote_3150" class="fnanchor">3150</a> (the modern Mont Auxois),
and which are narrower than the Stour at Wye, by the same name.
Moreover, as Lewin<a id="FNanchor_3151" href="#Footnote_3151" class="fnanchor">3151</a> justly remarks, Caesar, in describing the combat
which took place on the banks of the stream in question, and the
subsequent attack upon the British stronghold,<a id="FNanchor_3152" href="#Footnote_3152" class="fnanchor">3152</a> ‘does <i>not</i> make the
river the important part of the defence.’ The Stour at Wye and
the features of the surrounding country correspond sufficiently well
with Caesar’s account; but this does not constitute a positive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_634">634</span>
argument in favour of Lewin’s theory unless it can be proved that,
on the theory that Caesar landed in East Kent, it is impossible to
discover a stream which satisfies the requirements of his narrative.</p>

<p>D’Anville, the famous French geographer, added little or nothing
to the case for Hythe. He maintained that the ‘higher ground’
to which the Britons withdrew on descrying the Roman flotilla in
54 <small>B.C.</small> must have been the line of heights which extends just behind
Hythe.<a id="FNanchor_3153" href="#Footnote_3153" class="fnanchor">3153</a> But the passage in which Caesar describes the retirement
of the Britons, so far from implying that the ‘higher ground’ was
close to the landing-place, implies the very reverse; for Caesar,
immediately after telling us that the Britons had retired to higher
ground, expressly states that the position on which he found them
posted was about twelve miles from his camp near the sea.<a id="FNanchor_3154" href="#Footnote_3154" class="fnanchor">3154</a></p>

<p>Lewin has now had a fair hearing; and those who are interested
in the question will decide whether he has made out his case. Over
and above what has been said in refutation of his arguments there
remain other facts which make it absolutely certain that Caesar did
not land either at Hythe or at Lympne.</p>

<p>1. Caesar, as we have seen, tells us that when he sailed from the
Portus Itius for Britain in 54 <small>B.C.</small> the wind was from the south-west.<a id="FNanchor_3155" href="#Footnote_3155" class="fnanchor">3155</a>
Now a south-west wind would not have been favourable
to a voyage from Boulogne to Hythe, much less to Lympne. The
wind would have been abeam even if it had been possible to keep
the ships heading in the direction of Hythe, that is to say, even if
they had made no lee-way: the ships, being shallow and flat-bottomed,<a id="FNanchor_3156" href="#Footnote_3156" class="fnanchor">3156</a>
would have made considerable lee-way; and two or three hours
after the voyage began the current turned east-north-east, and
continued to run in that direction until daybreak<a id="FNanchor_3157" href="#Footnote_3157" class="fnanchor">3157</a>. It is curious
that so adroit a controversialist as Lewin should have inadvertently
quoted an opinion which damaged his own case. He tells us<a id="FNanchor_3158" href="#Footnote_3158" class="fnanchor">3158</a> that
a Mr. John Dougall, in an unpublished tract, remarked that Caesar
would have called the south-west wind favourable if he had sailed
from Boulogne for the South Foreland. But, on Lewin’s theory,
Caesar sailed, not for the South Foreland but for Hythe; and Lewin
naïvely tells us that, in Dougall’s opinion, Caesar would never have
called the wind favourable if it had been on the beam. Certainly
he would not have done so when the tide was setting in the wrong
direction.</p>

<p>2. Another objection to the theory that Caesar landed at Hythe
or Lympne is that it involves the assumption that when he started
on his first voyage, he steered for the unsuitable port of Folkestone,
or else that, although he was in possession of Volusenus’s report,
he did not know where he intended to land, and steered at haphazard.
According to Lewin’s original idea,<a id="FNanchor_3159" href="#Footnote_3159" class="fnanchor">3159</a> he first anchored off the cliffs of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_635">635</span>
Dover. This is the view which naturally commends itself to every
unbiassed reader of the <cite>Commentaries</cite>; but, as Lewin afterwards
saw, it is irreconcilable with the theory that Caesar sailed from his
anchorage either to Hythe or to Lympne; for Caesar tells us that
he sailed 7 Roman miles, and Hythe is almost 11, Lympne about 14,
Roman miles from the nearest point of the Dover cliffs.<a id="FNanchor_3160" href="#Footnote_3160" class="fnanchor">3160</a> Lewin
thus found himself obliged to relinquish his original view, and to
maintain that Caesar anchored off Folkestone,<a id="FNanchor_3161" href="#Footnote_3161" class="fnanchor">3161</a> or, as he suggests
in another passage, and implies in his map,<a id="FNanchor_3162" href="#Footnote_3162" class="fnanchor">3162</a> off East Wear Bay.
But second thoughts are not always best. Lewin insists that
Folkestone ‘would be the natural port for Boulogne’.<a id="FNanchor_3163" href="#Footnote_3163" class="fnanchor">3163</a> Why?
Surely not because the steamboats of the South Eastern and Chatham
Railway Company discharge their passengers there! ‘The natural
port for Boulogne’ would be the port to which, having regard to
the prevailing winds and the currents, it would be easiest to sail,
and which would best accommodate Caesar’s fleet. That port was
Dover. Caesar’s narrative shows that he required a capacious
harbour;<a id="FNanchor_3164" href="#Footnote_3164" class="fnanchor">3164</a> and the port of Folkestone was too small.</p>

<p>3. Another consideration&mdash;one of several which, strange to say,
have hitherto been overlooked&mdash;is alone fatal to the theory that
Caesar landed either at Hythe or at Lympne. He tells us, in regard
to his first landing, that his troops were not able to pursue the
enemy far ‘because the cavalry had not been able to keep their
course and make the island’.<a id="FNanchor_3165" href="#Footnote_3165" class="fnanchor">3165</a> These words unmistakably imply
that if he had had his cavalry with him, he would have been able
to make good use of them; and in fact he says expressly that, in
repelling the attack which the Britons made upon his camp just
before his departure from Britain in 55 <small>B.C.</small>, he actually did employ
Commius’s small troop of cavalry.<a id="FNanchor_3166" href="#Footnote_3166" class="fnanchor">3166</a> The camp, so Lewin assures us
when he is advocating the cause of Lympne, was ‘in the marsh’.<a id="FNanchor_3167" href="#Footnote_3167" class="fnanchor">3167</a>
How, then, would Caesar have been able to utilize his cavalry?
Would he have sent them up the steep slopes on which stand the
ruins of Stutfall Castle? Even on the incredible hypothesis that
Romney Marsh had been embanked by the Britons<a id="FNanchor_3168" href="#Footnote_3168" class="fnanchor">3168</a> the cavalry
would have been useless; for how could they have acted in a country
intersected by sluices?<a id="FNanchor_3169" href="#Footnote_3169" class="fnanchor">3169</a> It is possible, indeed, that if Caesar had
landed at Hythe, his cavalry might have acted in ‘the field to the
south and east of Hythe’, in which Lewin finally assumes that the
combat took place on the day of the landing,&mdash;if the Britons had
patiently waited to receive their charge, and if the field was not
under water.<a id="FNanchor_3170" href="#Footnote_3170" class="fnanchor">3170</a> But before the cavalry could have come into action
the Britons would have been on the hills behind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_636">636</span></p>

<p>I do not deny that the cavalry could have managed to trot up
Lympne Hill or the hills behind Hythe, if Caesar had been so foolish
as to give the order.<a id="FNanchor_3171" href="#Footnote_3171" class="fnanchor">3171</a> But the point is that the absence of the
cavalry prevented Caesar from pursuing the fugitives <i>far</i>; and that
the hills would have effectually concealed from him the nature of
the country that lay beyond them, its woods, defiles, and other
obstacles. Does he not tell us himself that when he had gained
a victory on the day after his second landing in Britain, ‘he forbade
[his troops] to pursue the fugitives far, partly <i>because he had no
knowledge of the ground</i>’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eos fugientes longius Caesar prosequi vetuit,
et quod loci naturam ignorabat</i>,<a id="FNanchor_3172" href="#Footnote_3172" class="fnanchor">3172</a> &amp;c.)? Worse ground for the
manœuvring of cavalry than the wooded heights which extended
behind Hythe and West Hythe it would have been hard for Volusenus
to find.</p>

<p>4. Heller<a id="FNanchor_3173" href="#Footnote_3173" class="fnanchor">3173</a> has acutely seen that Caesar’s account of the movements
of one division of the ships which carried his cavalry is irreconcilable
with the theory that he landed at any point on the south
coast of Britain. Caesar<a id="FNanchor_3174" href="#Footnote_3174" class="fnanchor">3174</a> tells us that the storm which arose when
these vessels were sighted from his camp drove some of them ‘to
the lower and more westerly part of the island’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliae ad inferiorem
partem insulae, quae est propius solis occasum, ... deicerentur</i>).
‘This,’ says Heller, ‘can only mean a different side of the island
from that on which Caesar was: if he had meant to designate
a point on the same side, he would have said, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paulo infra ac propius
solis occasum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_3175" href="#Footnote_3175" class="fnanchor">3175</a> If one compares the expression which he actually
uses in the thirteenth chapter of his Fifth Book&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unum latus est
contra Galliam. Huius lateris alter angulus, qui est ad Cantium, quo
fere omnes ex Gallia naves appelluntur, ad orientem solem, inferior
ad meridiem spectat</i><a id="FNanchor_3176" href="#Footnote_3176" class="fnanchor">3176</a>&mdash;it becomes clear that in the passage in which
the fate of the eighteen ships is described <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inferior pars insulae</i> means
the southern side of the island. Consequently Caesar implies that
his camp was on the eastern angle.’</p>

<p>5. One of the episodes which Caesar describes in his narrative
of the first expedition is, in spite of the ingenuity with which Lewin
has tried to make it fit in with his theory, irreconcilable with the
view that he landed either at Hythe or Lympne. One day, when
the 7th legion had gone out to cut corn, Caesar learned from the
troops on guard in front of the camp that an extraordinary quantity
of dust was visible in the direction in which the legion had gone.
He marched to the rescue, and, after he had advanced some little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_637">637</span>
distance (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paulo longius</i>), he found that the legion was hard pressed
by the enemy. The place where the legionaries had been reaping
was the only one in which the corn had not yet been cut; and the
enemy, anticipating that they would come there, posted themselves
in ambush in a wood close by.<a id="FNanchor_3177" href="#Footnote_3177" class="fnanchor">3177</a> Lewin<a id="FNanchor_3178" href="#Footnote_3178" class="fnanchor">3178</a> argues that the camp must
have been in Romney Marsh, ‘probably on the seaside’; but he
stultifies his own argument by admitting, in his appendix, that the
marsh was inundated at every high tide.<a id="FNanchor_3179" href="#Footnote_3179" class="fnanchor">3179</a> In his text he admits
that neither the cornfield nor the wood could have been in the
marsh; and he could not at first conceive how, if they had been
anywhere else, the dust raised by the combatants could have been
seen from the ground in front of the camp. But, he continues,
‘when I visited Hythe by land, and walked from it to the old port
of Limne, and mounted the hill, I discovered the explanation. On
reaching the top I stepped at once into a cornfield ... and on my
right was Park Wood.... What I had taken from the sea for a hill
... had no descent on the north side ... and corn growing so near
to the edge that even the reapers, if labouring in that part of the
field, might have been seen from the camp. The whole narrative
was now realized to the mind’s eye.... The legion had marched up
to the standing fields of corn on the high ground, and the Britons,
starting from their lurking-place at the side, had intercepted their
retreat, and surrounded them at just such an interval from the edge
that the combatants were out of sight and hearing, but the dust
flying in the air had attracted the attention of the guard ... at a
mile’s distance below.’</p>

<p>Now observe what becomes of Lewin’s explanation. First, ‘the
old port of Limne,’ to which he walked, became, before the publication
of his second edition, a figment of the imagination! Having
obtained, as he tells us, ‘more accurate information,’ he strenuously
denied its existence, and accordingly transferred Caesar’s landing-place
to Hythe.<a id="FNanchor_3180" href="#Footnote_3180" class="fnanchor">3180</a> Yet in this same second edition the ‘explanation’
is offered as confidently as ever! Secondly, he asks us to believe
that the only cornfield which the Romans had left unreaped was
the one nearest them! Thus the ‘explanation’ which Lewin discovered
with such pride collapses; and his theory, which cannot
stand without it, falls like a house of cards. What explanation he
would have discovered on the theory that Caesar landed at Hythe,
he wisely omits to say.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_638">638</span></p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg638">IX. THE THEORY THAT CAESAR LANDED AT HURST</h3>

<p>The latest supporters of the theory that Caesar landed on Romney
Marsh are Mr. H. E. Malden and, tentatively, Mr. Warde Fowler<a id="FNanchor_3181" href="#Footnote_3181" class="fnanchor">3181</a>
and Professor Pelham.<a id="FNanchor_3182" href="#Footnote_3182" class="fnanchor">3182</a> Mr. Malden relies upon the argument,
drawn from the study of the tides, which I have already refuted.<a id="FNanchor_3183" href="#Footnote_3183" class="fnanchor">3183</a>
But on certain points of detail he differs from Lewin. He maintains
that Lewin’s description of Romney Marsh, as it existed in the time
of Caesar, is incorrect, and that ‘the coast-line then ran nearly east
and west from Sandgate towards Appledore’. In other words, he
maintains that the hills which bound Romney Marsh on the north
were accessible ‘by ships sailing over what is now embanked land’.
Accordingly he believes that Caesar landed neither at Hythe nor
at Lympne, but ‘on a broad flat muddy shore’ near Hurst, that is
to say, about three miles west of Lympne. This, he assures us,
‘was a landing-place second to none’; so presumably the mud was
a recommendation. Mr. Malden notes that there was ‘good camping-ground,
wood and water on the slope above’; but a few lines
lower down he observes that ‘there would be good camping-ground
on the slope where Stutfall castle now stands’; that is to say, three
miles off on the east! He assures us, further, that ‘the place agrees
singularly with the account of the battle on the shore’; that ‘the
passage into the inner country would be easy by the break in the
hill above West Hythe’; and that ‘the hill is anywhere accessible’.
Finally, he remarks that ‘in <small>A.D.</small> 893 Hastings the pirate came
here with his fleet’.<a id="FNanchor_3184" href="#Footnote_3184" class="fnanchor">3184</a></p>

<p>Now Lewin, as I have already shown,<a id="FNanchor_3185" href="#Footnote_3185" class="fnanchor">3185</a> gives three successive and
different descriptions of Romney Marsh as it existed in the time of
Caesar; and Mr. Malden does not say to which of the three he
refers. It is evident, however, that he is thinking of the first;
and I am afraid that he did not take the trouble to read the second
edition of Lewin’s book. In a previous article<a id="FNanchor_3186" href="#Footnote_3186" class="fnanchor">3186</a> I have examined
all Lewin’s theories. I will here assume that Mr. Malden is right;
that the coast-line ‘ran nearly east and west from Sandgate towards
Appledore’; and that the northern fringe of Romney Marsh was
accessible ‘by ships sailing over what is now embanked land’.
On this hypothesis and on any other it is absolutely certain that
Caesar could not have landed at the point which Mr. Malden indicates.
He does not know what ‘good camping-ground’, in the
circumstances of ancient warfare, was. If he knew the <cite>Commentaries</cite>
as intimately as a man who professes to explain them should do, he
would see that neither at Hurst, nor ‘on the slope where Stutfall
castle now stands’, nor at any intermediate point did good camping-ground
exist; for everywhere along this line a camp would have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_639">639</span>
been dominated by higher ground above. Does Mr. Malden not
remember the words in which Caesar describes the camping-ground
which Reginus and Rebilus were compelled by adverse circumstances
to occupy at Alesia? They ‘were obliged’, he says, ‘to make the
camp on a gentle slope, which gave an assailant a slight advantage’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">necessario paene iniquo loco et leniter declivi castra fecerunt</i><a id="FNanchor_3187" href="#Footnote_3187" class="fnanchor">3187</a>). The
slope between Hurst and Stutfall Castle would have given an assailant
not a slight but a considerable advantage. Where, then, could
Caesar have found the ‘advantageous position’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loco idoneo</i><a id="FNanchor_3188" href="#Footnote_3188" class="fnanchor">3188</a>) which
he selected for his camp in 54 <small>B.C.</small>? ‘Hastings the pirate,’ as
I have already proved,<a id="FNanchor_3189" href="#Footnote_3189" class="fnanchor">3189</a> did <i>not</i> ‘come here with his fleet’; and
what good Caesar’s cavalry, the absence of which he deplored,
could have done by pounding up the hill, which was overgrown by
woods,<a id="FNanchor_3190" href="#Footnote_3190" class="fnanchor">3190</a> Mr. Malden does not explain. The hill, as he says, is
‘everywhere accessible’,&mdash;to a pedestrian: but, as I have already
shown,<a id="FNanchor_3191" href="#Footnote_3191" class="fnanchor">3191</a> ‘the passage into the inner country,’ <i>in the face of armed
resistance</i>, could only have been effected with heavy loss; and it
would be interesting to hear Mr. Malden account for the fact that
the Britons retired in 54 <small>B.C.</small> to ‘higher ground’ twelve miles from
the landing-place, when, just above the landing-place which he
calls ‘second to none’, there was ground 312 feet above the level
of the sea, and 300 feet above the present elevated level of the marsh.<a id="FNanchor_3192" href="#Footnote_3192" class="fnanchor">3192</a>
I should also like to hear him explain why Volusenus, a trained
soldier who thoroughly understood his business, should have advised
Caesar to land at Hurst rather than between Walmer and Deal;
what motive could have induced Caesar to attempt to sail from
Wissant (which he identifies with the Portus Itius) to Hurst with
a south-west wind, that is to say, to attempt to sail west-north-west,
on an easterly-going stream, within six points of the wind; how
his cavalry transports contrived to sail back from a point near Hurst
to Sangatte, or even to Ambleteuse, against a gale which drove
their sister ships towards the west; or by what miracle this gale
dashed his ships ashore in a northerly direction!</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg639">X. THE THEORY THAT CAESAR LANDED BETWEEN
HURST AND KENNARDINGTON</h3>

<p>The late Francis Hobson Appach published in 1868 a book called
<cite>Caius Julius Caesar’s British Expeditions</cite>, the principal object of
which was to prove that Caesar’s troops disembarked in 55 <small>B.C.</small>
between ‘the foot of the spur from Aldington Knoll’ (which is
about four miles west of Lympne) on the right, and a point ‘about
half way between Bonnington and Bilsington’ on the left;<a id="FNanchor_3193" href="#Footnote_3193" class="fnanchor">3193</a> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_640">640</span>
that in the following year the left of the line extended as far westward
as Kennardington. This theory differs but slightly in locality
from Mr. Malden’s, but is defended by different arguments; and,
moreover, from Bonnington westward the slope of the hills which
bound Romney Marsh on the north becomes much gentler. Appach
maintains that at least the northern portion, if not the whole, of
the marsh was, in Caesar’s time, submerged, and that its northern
fringe was accessible to ships sailing from the east. His arguments
have already been refuted in an earlier section of this book;<a id="FNanchor_3194" href="#Footnote_3194" class="fnanchor">3194</a> but
for the purpose of the present inquiry I will assume that he made
out his case, and that, in Caesar’s time, ‘the Bay of Apuldore,’ to
which he constantly alludes, was, as he assures us, deep enough to
float ‘the heaviest of Caesar’s ships at the lowest spring tides’.<a id="FNanchor_3195" href="#Footnote_3195" class="fnanchor">3195</a></p>

<p>Appach, of course, like Lewin and Airy, bases his theory upon
the hypothesis that the tidal stream which Caesar had in his favour
when he sailed from his anchorage to his landing-place must have
set towards the west. Although I have proved that this hypothesis
is untenable, I will assume, in order to do justice to Appach’s arguments,
that Caesar may have sailed with the westward stream.</p>

<p>1. Appach begins by arguing that Volusenus, when he was
reconnoitring the British coast, found on the west of Aldington
Knoll ‘the very ground of which he was in search’, namely, ‘a low
level coast’, which ‘extended as far as Apuldore ... forming the
head of a bay protected from the waves in the Channel by the cliff
at Fairlight ... and the cliff at Folkestone’.<a id="FNanchor_3196" href="#Footnote_3196" class="fnanchor">3196</a></p>

<p>It may be freely admitted that this coast, if it was accessible
by sea, would have been a convenient landing-place, if Caesar had
only desired to land, and then to sail away again. But his object
was to invade Britain; and the landing-place which Appach believes
Volusenus to have selected would have led Caesar into the inhospitable
forest of Anderida,<a id="FNanchor_3197" href="#Footnote_3197" class="fnanchor">3197</a> where no corn was to be procured. This
objection, indeed, is equally fatal to Mr. Malden’s theory; and
neither he nor Appach attempts to explain how there could have
been ‘buildings far and wide’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnibus longe lateque aedificiis
incensis</i>) on those lonely slopes, on which, even now, woods are
abundant, and buildings very few and very far between.<a id="FNanchor_3198" href="#Footnote_3198" class="fnanchor">3198</a></p>

<p>2. Appach tells us that Caesar’s original intention was to disembark
between Sandgate and Hythe; and it must be borne in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_641">641</span>
mind that, according to him, Hythe harbour, as described by Lewin,
did not then exist. ‘This landing place,’ he says, ‘though open
to the south and east, was sheltered on the north and west. It was
also sheltered from the force of the sea and stream in the Channel,
and must therefore have been the principal British port on this
part of the coast in the time of Caesar.’<a id="FNanchor_3199" href="#Footnote_3199" class="fnanchor">3199</a></p>

<p>Perhaps (if it had existed),&mdash;‘on this part of the coast’. But then
Caesar<a id="FNanchor_3200" href="#Footnote_3200" class="fnanchor">3200</a> says that ‘almost all ships from Gaul’ used to make for
what he calls the eastern ‘corner’ of Britain, ‘by Kent.’ He may
have been thinking of Dover, or of Richborough, perhaps of both;
but I doubt whether it is possible to force into his words the meaning
that the harbour where ‘almost all ships from Gaul’ discharged
their freight was between Sandgate and Hythe.</p>

<p>3. But let us assume that Caesar intended, for some inscrutable
reason, to land between Sandgate and Hythe. What, then, were
the ‘precipitous heights’ off which he anchored,&mdash;the heights from
which it was possible to throw a missile right on to the shore?
Can Appach find them? Yes! He tells us that they are there,
and that if we look for them anywhere else, we shall look in vain.<a id="FNanchor_3201" href="#Footnote_3201" class="fnanchor">3201</a>
He bids us note carefully the passage in which Caesar describes
them:&mdash;‘there, standing in full view on all the heights, he saw
an armed force of the enemy. The formation of the ground was
peculiar, the sea being so closely walled in by abrupt heights that
it was possible to throw a missile from the ground above on to the
shore’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in omnibus collibus expositas hostium copias armatas conspexit.
Cuius loci haec erat natura, atque ita montibus angustis mare
continebatur, uti ex locis superioribus in litus telum adigi posset</i><a id="FNanchor_3202" href="#Footnote_3202" class="fnanchor">3202</a>).
You are to observe, says Appach, that ‘Caesar uses the word “all” ... thus
pointedly implying, if not ... asserting that there were
more than two hills’. We are then told that, ‘it being about half
an hour after high water, the sea reached quite up to the mouths of
the three valleys between Hythe and Sandgate, so that the bay
of Hythe appeared to Caesar to be shut in by the hills exactly as
he describes it.’</p>

<p>Now these words alone are evidence that Appach did not know
enough Latin to qualify him for the task which he had undertaken.
That he should have misconstrued the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">montibus angustis
mare continebatur</i> is not so surprising; but to a man who is familiar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_642">642</span>
with Caesar’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usus loquendi</i>, the conclusion which Appach draws
from the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnibus collibus</i>&mdash;that Caesar must have seen at
least three <i>separate hills</i>&mdash;will appear somewhat forced.<a id="FNanchor_3203" href="#Footnote_3203" class="fnanchor">3203</a> If he had
engaged a boat at Dover, and looked at the cliffs stretching away
eastward towards the South Foreland, he would have seen that they
answered exactly to Caesar’s description. The upper edge of the
chalk is not a straight line: it rises and falls in a succession of deep
curves, corresponding with the rolling downs above, which are, so
to speak, divided into a series of heights by well-defined depressions.
Here are the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnes colles</i>, as plain as can be, not three of them but
six,<a id="FNanchor_3204" href="#Footnote_3204" class="fnanchor">3204</a> between the Priory Valley and the South Foreland. And
Appach wants us to believe that the hills between Sandgate and
Hythe are ‘precipitous heights’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angusti montes</i>), from the summits
of which it would have been possible to throw a missile right on to
the shore. Precipitous heights! Go, reader, and look at them.<a id="FNanchor_3205" href="#Footnote_3205" class="fnanchor">3205</a></p>

<p>4. Appach candidly admits that Caesar, on his imaginary voyage
from Hythe to Bonnington, lost off Lympne the benefit of the
westward current, and ‘met the eddy in the bay of Apuldore running
from west to east along its northern shore’:<a id="FNanchor_3206" href="#Footnote_3206" class="fnanchor">3206</a> but by this
candour he gives away his whole case; for who will believe that
Caesar would have told us that he ‘got the stream in his favour’
if the stream had turned against him before he had completed half
his journey?</p>

<p>5. Again, Appach observes that Caesar’s account of his first
landing implies that the Britons who opposed him used their
chariots as well as their cavalry; and he scoffs at the notion that
the chariot-horses or even the cavalry could have acted on shingle.
Therefore, he concludes, ‘there could have been no shingle at the
place where Caesar landed. Bonnington fulfils this condition.’<a id="FNanchor_3207" href="#Footnote_3207" class="fnanchor">3207</a></p>

<p>Quite so; and the coast north of Sandown Castle also practically
fulfils, or once fulfilled, this condition.<a id="FNanchor_3208" href="#Footnote_3208" class="fnanchor">3208</a> If Appach’s argument shows
that Caesar did not land on shingle, it does not show that he landed
at Bonnington. Moreover, granting that Caesar’s narrative implies
that chariots were used by the Britons in opposing the landing,
Appach fails to realize the situation. The horses were not required
to gallop into the sea; nor could they have galloped through the
waves at Bonnington any more than at Lympne, or Hythe, or
Deal: but at any of those places they could have seriously obstructed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_643">643</span>
men who could hardly keep their footing, and who were encumbered
by their armour in the way which Caesar<a id="FNanchor_3209" href="#Footnote_3209" class="fnanchor">3209</a> so graphically
describes. All that the horses had to do was to convey their masters
‘a little way into the water’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paulum in aquam</i> [progressi]), so as
to enable them to throw their missiles with effect; and this they
could easily have done if they had drawn their light cars no faster
than the ancient steeds which drag, or used to drag, bathing-machines
over the shingle at Eastbourne.</p>

<p>6. Finally, Appach cites the well-known passage in which Caesar
tells us that at daybreak on his second voyage he ‘descried Britain
lying behind on the port quarter’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub sinistra Britanniam relictam
conspexit</i>). He argues that Caesar’s words would be meaningless
‘if the configuration of the coast had been the same in his day as
it is at the present time, for Britain could not ... have been in any
other position. The expression, however, is peculiarly appropriate
if the sea then filled the Bay of Apuldore; for Caesar, sailing, as he
thought, from Boulogne to Kennardington, of course expected to
see Britain on his right.’<a id="FNanchor_3210" href="#Footnote_3210" class="fnanchor">3210</a></p>

<p>Yes, <i>we</i> of course see that, as Caesar was drifting up channel,
‘Britain could not have been in any other position’ than on his
left. But Caesar was not writing for us: he was writing for his
countrymen, who did not know anything about the configuration
of Britain until they had read as far as the thirteenth chapter of
his Fifth Book.<a id="FNanchor_3211" href="#Footnote_3211" class="fnanchor">3211</a> Moreover, if Appach had known his Polybius, he
would have remembered the passage in which readers who had passed
their lives in the Mediterranean basin were informed of the self-evident
fact that Hannibal, marching eastward through Southern
Gaul, had the Mediterranean on his right.<a id="FNanchor_3212" href="#Footnote_3212" class="fnanchor">3212</a> Furthermore, if Caesar
had steered for Kennardington, he would have had to drift more
than fifteen nautical miles in order to reach a point opposite the
South Foreland: it would have been impossible to drift nearly so
far between ‘about midnight’ and daybreak;<a id="FNanchor_3213" href="#Footnote_3213" class="fnanchor">3213</a> and unless he had
drifted further, he could not have seen Britain ‘lying behind’ on
his left.<a id="FNanchor_3214" href="#Footnote_3214" class="fnanchor">3214</a></p>

<p>I need hardly add that Appach does not explain how those
cavalry transports got back, in spite of the north-easterly or east-north-easterly
gale, from off Bonnington to Ambleteuse.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show that, even if ‘the Bay of Apuldore’,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_644">644</span>
as Appach describes it, existed in Caesar’s time, he never sailed its
waters. We now know where to look for his landing-place: he
must have first set foot in Britain on the eastern coast of Kent.</p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg644">XI. THE THEORY THAT CAESAR LANDED BETWEEN
WALMER AND DEAL</h3>

<p>The oldest English writers whose works have come down to us
believed that Caesar had landed on the north of the South Foreland.
This was certainly the view of Nennius, or of an author whose work
Nennius edited;<a id="FNanchor_3215" href="#Footnote_3215" class="fnanchor">3215</a> and Dr. Guest attached great weight to his testimony.<a id="FNanchor_3216" href="#Footnote_3216" class="fnanchor">3216</a>
I think that, in doing so, he showed less than his usual
judgement; and perhaps he was not aware that Maistre Wace,
who lived in the twelfth century, had anticipated the modern theory
that Caesar landed on Romney Marsh.<a id="FNanchor_3217" href="#Footnote_3217" class="fnanchor">3217</a> For some centuries, however,
the prevailing view, first definitely stated, if I am not mistaken,
by Leland,<a id="FNanchor_3218" href="#Footnote_3218" class="fnanchor">3218</a> who lived in the reign of Henry the Eighth, was that
the disembarkation took place near Deal.<a id="FNanchor_3219" href="#Footnote_3219" class="fnanchor">3219</a></p>

<p>1. We know that Caesar, before he set sail from Gaul, intended
to land, if possible, in one of the harbours of Britain; for he instructed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_645">645</span>
Volusenus to ascertain what harbours were capable of
accommodating a numerous fleet, and, before he set sail, a deputation
came to him from numerous British tribes to promise submission.<a id="FNanchor_3220" href="#Footnote_3220" class="fnanchor">3220</a>
The choice, as we have seen, lies between the harbours of
Dover and Folkestone; and it is not credible that Caesar should
have deliberately preferred the small harbour of Folkestone to the
more spacious and more easily accessible harbour of Dover.<a id="FNanchor_3221" href="#Footnote_3221" class="fnanchor">3221</a> And
if he steered for Dover harbour, the ‘precipitous heights’ off which
he anchored in 55 <small>B.C.</small> must have been, not the cliffs of East Wear
Bay, but the cliffs between Dover and the South Foreland.<a id="FNanchor_3222" href="#Footnote_3222" class="fnanchor">3222</a></p>

<p>Airy,<a id="FNanchor_3223" href="#Footnote_3223" class="fnanchor">3223</a> indeed, denies that Caesar ever intended to land in a harbour.
‘This,’ he says, ‘is not the manner of attempting debarkation
in a country possessed by an enemy.... Sir Arthur Wellesley
made no attempt at Lisbon, but put his troops on shore at the
Mondego Beach.’ I wonder whether Airy knew the circumstances
and the motives which determined Wellesley’s action: at all events
his argument will not mislead any reader who has studied the
history of the Peninsular War. Why did Wellesley make ‘no
attempt at Lisbon’? Simply because, as Napier<a id="FNanchor_3224" href="#Footnote_3224" class="fnanchor">3224</a> says, ‘the
strength of the French, the bar of the river, the disposition of the
forts, the difficulty of landing in the immediate neighbourhood,
where a heavy surf broke in all the undefended creeks and bays,
convinced him such an enterprise was unadvisable if not impracticable....
It was difficult to find a place to land. The coast, from
the Minho to the Tagus, save at a few points, is rugged and dangerous;
all the river harbours have bars and are difficult of access
even for boats.... Seventy miles northward of the Lisbon Rock,
the small peninsula of Peniché offered the only safe and accessible
bay adapted for a disembarkation; but the anchorage was within
range of the fort, which contained a hundred guns and a garrison
of a thousand men. The next best place was the Mondego river;
there the little fort of Figueras, now occupied by English marines,
secured a free entrance, and Sir Arthur adopted it.’ The reader
will have noticed that Airy not only ignores the circumstances
which forbade Wellesley to attempt a landing at Lisbon, but also
ignores the existence of the Mondego river.<a id="FNanchor_3225" href="#Footnote_3225" class="fnanchor">3225</a> Caesar put his troops
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_646">646</span>
ashore on a beach; but he had intended to put them on shore in
the best available harbour, because, unlike Wellesley, he had had
reason to hope that his landing would not be opposed. If he did
not intend to land in a harbour, why did he instruct Volusenus to
report upon the Kentish harbours? And why did he steer towards
‘precipitous heights’, at the foot of which the dullest soldier in
his army knew that it would be madness to land, if he did not intend
to enter the harbour formed by the gap in those cliffs? Why did
the enemy occupy those heights unless they believed that this was
his intention? It might, indeed, be argued that after he received
Volusenus’s report, he decided that Dover harbour was unsuitable,
and therefore abandoned all idea of landing in a harbour. If so,
he would not have steered towards the Dover cliffs; but neither
would he have steered towards those of Folkestone or East Wear
Bay. The only alternative would be to assume that he anchored
off the lower cliffs north of St. Margaret’s Bay in order to wait
for the overdue ships, having intended from the outset of his voyage
to sail on and land north of Walmer.<a id="FNanchor_3226" href="#Footnote_3226" class="fnanchor">3226</a> But when he says that ‘he
thought the place [off which he anchored] most unsuitable for
landing’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hunc ad egrediendum nequaquam idoneum locum arbitratus</i>),<a id="FNanchor_3227" href="#Footnote_3227" class="fnanchor">3227</a>
he unmistakably implies that he had contemplated the possibility
of landing there; and, as he could have decided with his eyes
shut that it would be absurd to land at the foot of ‘precipitous
heights’, he must have concluded that it would be unwise to attempt
to land, in the face of an enemy, in the harbour which was formed
by the gap in the cliffs. Probably, before he knew that his landing
would be opposed, he intended to observe the harbour with his
own eyes and decide upon its merits himself.</p>

<p>Mr. H. E. Malden, however, remarks that, according to Dion
Cassius, ‘Caesar made the land on the first occasion where he
ought not, οὐ μέντοι καὶ ᾗ ἔδει προσέσχεν.’ ‘Surely,’ Mr. Malden
continues, ‘this implies not that Caesar aimed at a certain point
for a landing place and then abandoned it upon a nearer view,
but that something like what befell him on the second voyage
happened on the first also, and that he drifted out of his course to
a point which he did not intend to reach. If so, this disposes of all
idea of his aiming at Dover as the usual port of landing.’<a id="FNanchor_3228" href="#Footnote_3228" class="fnanchor">3228</a></p>

<p>Yes,&mdash;‘if so’. According to Mr. Malden,<a id="FNanchor_3229" href="#Footnote_3229" class="fnanchor">3229</a> Caesar landed near
Hurst in Romney Marsh. On this theory, he would have anchored
off the coast near Sandgate, which was very little out of his course
if he intended to land near Hurst, and not at all out of his course
if, as Mr. Malden wrongly supposes, he sailed from Wissant. It is
universally admitted, and it is certain that when Caesar was approaching
Britain, and for some hours previously, the tidal stream was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_647">647</span>
running up the Channel. Will Mr. Malden explain what that current
could have been which would have caused Caesar’s ships, while
steering either from Wissant or from Boulogne for Hurst, to
‘drift’ towards Sandgate <i>on the eastward stream</i>?</p>

<p>2. The reader is already familiar with the subject of the tidal
streams, in so far as it relates to the present discussion.<a id="FNanchor_3230" href="#Footnote_3230" class="fnanchor">3230</a> As we have
seen,<a id="FNanchor_3231" href="#Footnote_3231" class="fnanchor">3231</a> Caesar may have landed in Britain on the 26th of August,
55 <small>B.C.</small>; and on that day high water should have occurred at Dover
at 6.21 a.m. I say ‘should have occurred’, because observations have
shown that high tide sometimes occurs a few minutes earlier or
later than the time predicted in the Admiralty <cite>Tide Tables</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_3232" href="#Footnote_3232" class="fnanchor">3232</a> Therefore,
<i>accepting the general rule laid down by Admiral Beechey and
Surveyor Calver</i>,<a id="FNanchor_3233" href="#Footnote_3233" class="fnanchor">3233</a> the stream off the Dover cliffs would have turned
to the west some time between 10.21 and 11.9 a.m., and again to
the east at 5.24 p.m.</p>

<p>But Caesar, we are assured by Airy and Lewin, weighed anchor
at 3 p.m.; and at 3 p.m. the stream would still have been running
towards the west. The argument has imposed upon weak minds:
the reader will see that it has not the slightest force. There is no
evidence that Caesar weighed anchor at 3 p.m. What he says is
simply that he awaited at anchor the arrival of the rest of the ships&mdash;the
ships which had failed to keep pace with the leading division
of the fleet&mdash;until the ninth hour. The ninth hour in the latitude
of Dover lasted on the 26th of August from 2.20 till 3.30 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_3234" href="#Footnote_3234" class="fnanchor">3234</a>
Therefore Caesar, assuming that his statement was literally correct,
may have waited at anchor for the arrival of the laggard ships until
3.30 p.m. Now, as the reader will remember, I have demonstrated,
from the evidence to which Airy appeals&mdash;the evidence supplied by
Admiral Beechey and Surveyor Calver&mdash;that on the day of Caesar’s
landing the tidal stream may have turned eastward earlier than
3.54 p.m.;<a id="FNanchor_3235" href="#Footnote_3235" class="fnanchor">3235</a> and if it turned twenty-five minutes earlier, it turned
in the ninth hour.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_648">648</span></p>

<p>Hitherto we have assumed that Caesar’s statements of the hour
up to which he awaited the arrival of his overdue ships was literally
correct. But now let me beg any one who still feels a doubt whether
his narrative agrees with the hypothesis that he sailed eastward
from his anchorage, to use his common sense and to remember that
he has a sense of humour. Airy, Lewin, Mr. Malden, and the rest
argue in this strain:&mdash;Caesar waited at anchor till 3 [or 3.30] p.m.,
and not a minute later: the stream was then running westward;
therefore Caesar sailed towards the west.&mdash;<i>Q.E.D.</i> This is the sort
of argument that might have been expected, not from an Astronomer
Royal, or from a barrister like Lewin who knew the world, but
from a clever schoolboy. Yet not a single commentator has ever
pointed out its absurdity. Had Airy forgotten the discrepant
statements that were made by officers who had watches in their
pockets as to the hour at which this or that episode occurred in the
campaign of Waterloo?<a id="FNanchor_3236" href="#Footnote_3236" class="fnanchor">3236</a> Did Airy or Lewin imagine that Caesar
had a Dent’s chronometer on board his galley, and, the moment
after he weighed anchor, noted down in his diary the words, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hora
nona ancorae sublatae sunt?</i> It is possible that he may have had
a water-clock (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clepsydra</i>)<a id="FNanchor_3237" href="#Footnote_3237" class="fnanchor">3237</a> on board, which would have enabled him,
if it had been duly corrected for the latitude of Dover, and if the
sea had been so smooth that the ship was motionless, to tell the
time approximately; but surely it is probable that he roughly
estimated the time from his observation of the altitude of the sun?<a id="FNanchor_3238" href="#Footnote_3238" class="fnanchor">3238</a>
And is it not equally probable that he trusted not to a diary but
to his memory? His estimate may have been right: but also it
may have been wrong; and anyhow it is folly to stake the whole
argument upon its accuracy.</p>

<p>Nor, again, is it even certain that Caesar did weigh anchor at
the time which he called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">horam nonam</i>. As he says that he waited
for the arrival of his overdue ships till the ninth hour, it may be
presumed that they did not arrive earlier. When they arrived,
their captains had, I suppose, to receive instructions, as the generals
and military tribunes had done already. As Heller<a id="FNanchor_3239" href="#Footnote_3239" class="fnanchor">3239</a> and de Saulcy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_649">649</span>
have argued, we have no right to infer from the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in ancoris
exspectavit</i> that when the period of waiting was over, Caesar ceased
to remain at anchor.<a id="FNanchor_3240" href="#Footnote_3240" class="fnanchor">3240</a> And, even if he gave no instructions to the
captains of the laggard ships, but left them to their own devices,
it remains certain that to get the ships into order, to give the signal
for starting, and to weigh anchor, consumed an appreciable time.</p>

<p>But we need not insist upon this argument. We may rest satisfied
with the knowledge that the stream may have turned earlier than
3.54 p.m.<a id="FNanchor_3241" href="#Footnote_3241" class="fnanchor">3241</a> We may be assured that Caesar had no means of knowing
exactly at what time he weighed anchor; and therefore, even if he
intended to convey that he weighed anchor in the ninth hour, we are
not compelled to assume that he did so before 3.30 p.m. We know
that <i>Caesar was too wise to start for a seven miles’ sail on the last of
the ebb tide, when the current was slowest, and when he would have had
no certainty that it might not turn against him before he had completed
his voyage</i>; and we are confirmed in this conviction by his own
words, which tell us that he started when he had got wind and tide
in his favour. Finally, <i>we have proved that it is not improbable but
impossible that he landed either at Pevensey or on any part of Romney
Marsh</i>.<a id="FNanchor_3242" href="#Footnote_3242" class="fnanchor">3242</a> Thus the question of the direction in which the tide was
running when Caesar sailed from his anchorage, which in itself would
be doubtful, is settled by other considerations. There is but one
conclusion to which we can come, and that conclusion is absolutely
certain: when Caesar weighed anchor off the Kentish cliffs, he
sailed towards the north-east.<a id="FNanchor_3243" href="#Footnote_3243" class="fnanchor">3243</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_650">650</span></p>

<p>3. It will be remembered that Caesar, in describing the final
stage of his first voyage, says that he ‘moved on’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">progressus</i><a id="FNanchor_3244" href="#Footnote_3244" class="fnanchor">3244</a>),
seven miles from his anchorage. Both Long<a id="FNanchor_3245" href="#Footnote_3245" class="fnanchor">3245</a> and Heller<a id="FNanchor_3246" href="#Footnote_3246" class="fnanchor">3246</a> regard
the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">progressus</i> as a proof that Caesar must have landed on the
coast of East Kent. Had he anchored off East Wear Bay, and
sailed thence to Hythe or to Lympne, he would not, says Heller,
have continued <i>in a straight line</i> the direction of his voyage from
Gaul to Britain; but he would have done so if he had anchored off
the South Foreland and sailed thence to Deal. I do not commit
myself to absolute agreement with this argument, as it stands,
although every one who is familiar with Caesar’s use of the word
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">progredi</i><a id="FNanchor_3247" href="#Footnote_3247" class="fnanchor">3247</a> will admit that it would apply much better to a run from
the Dover cliffs to Walmer, made in continuation of a voyage from
Boulogne towards the South Foreland, than to a run from East Wear
Bay or from a point off Folkestone to Hythe or Lympne.</p>

<p>4. Dion Cassius says that Caesar, in sailing from his anchorage
to the place where he landed, rounded a promontory.<a id="FNanchor_3248" href="#Footnote_3248" class="fnanchor">3248</a> I attach
some importance to these words for the following reasons. Although
Dion is no authority in regard to such matters as the details of
a battle, and although, from carelessness or love of meretricious
ornament, he constantly misunderstood or misused his authorities,
it is not conceivable that he should have made so definite and simple
a statement as this without authority, unless he had invented it.
I am sure that every one who is capable of weighing the credibility
of an historical writer will agree with me that this is not such a statement
as Dion would have invented, and that it is such a statement
as the most careless and rhetorical of writers, if he had found it in an
authority, would have followed correctly. I therefore believe that
Dion took it from some authority which is now lost, and that it is
true. If so, the promontory which Caesar rounded can only have
been the South Foreland. Lewin<a id="FNanchor_3249" href="#Footnote_3249" class="fnanchor">3249</a> admits that the statement, ‘if
taken literally, looks as if he went round the South Foreland; but,’
he adds, ‘I am satisfied that if he had done so, Caesar would have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_651">651</span>
mentioned so remarkable a promontory’. This observation only
shows that Lewin was not familiar with Caesar’s style. Caesar did
not trouble himself about picturesque details, however remarkable
they might be, the mention of which was not essential to the clearness
of his narrative. ‘If,’ continues Lewin, ‘the descriptive words
of so late a writer as Dion are to have any weight, I should interpret
them as meaning only that Caesar sailed round the bend of the
precipitous shore between Folkestone and Sandgate ... or else that
Caesar arrived at first off Eastweir Bay ... and then sailed round
the cliff which shuts in the bay on the west.’ I doubt, however,
whether either ‘the bend’ or ‘the cliff’ could fairly have been
described as ‘a projecting headland’ (ἄκραν προέχουσαν); and
Lewin virtually admits that neither would have been worth mentioning.
But if any one gainsays this argument, we can well afford
to dispense with it.</p>

<p>5. If Volusenus deserved the confidence which Caesar reposed in
him, there cannot be the faintest doubt in the mind of any unprejudiced
man who has studied military history or even Caesar’s
<cite>Commentaries</cite>, and has taken the trouble to observe the features
of the Kentish coast, as to the landing-place which he would have
selected. He would not have wasted his time by cruising down
the coast of Sussex: the first sight of the lofty hills which hem in
East Wear Bay, of the cliffs which extend from Folkestone to Sandgate,
and of the heights which back the coast from Shorncliffe to
Lympne and beyond, would have warned him not to advise the great
captain whom he served to land beneath them; but, as his galley
glided past Kingsdown and neared Walmer, he saw, stretching away
towards the neighbourhood of Sandwich, the open coast, offering
easy access into the interior, of which he was in search. Here and
here only, if Dover Harbour were held by an enemy, it would be safe
to land. Here and here only it would be possible to follow up a victory
by an effective cavalry charge.</p>

<p>6. Assuming that Caesar landed in East Kent, his narrative of the
adventures of his cavalry transports and of the shipwrecks in 55 <small>B.C.</small>,
which, as we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_3250" href="#Footnote_3250" class="fnanchor">3250</a> is inexplicable on any other theory, presents
no difficulty. The transports which returned to the port whence
they started would have been laid to on the port tack, and would
have been carried back to Ambleteuse by the same wind which
drove their sister ships westward down the Channel.<a id="FNanchor_3251" href="#Footnote_3251" class="fnanchor">3251</a> This wind,
which could not have driven ashore, in the immediate neighbourhood
of their anchorage, vessels anchored off Lympne or Hythe,
would inevitably have driven ashore, once they had parted their
anchors, vessels lying off the coast between Walmer and Deal.<a id="FNanchor_3252" href="#Footnote_3252" class="fnanchor">3252</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_652">652</span></p>

<p>7. Finally, Caesar sailed on his second voyage to Britain with
a south-west wind; and a south-west wind would obviously have
been much more favourable to a voyage either from Boulogne or
from Wissant to Deal or to any point on the coast of East Kent
than to a voyage from Boulogne to Lympne or even Hythe.</p>

<p>It remains to consider objections.</p>

<p>1. I have already refuted Airy’s criticism of the view that Caesar
anchored off the cliffs of Dover; and we have seen that Airy is
compelled by his own argument to identify the cliffs which Caesar
describes as ‘precipitous heights’, and Cicero as ‘astonishing
masses of cliff’<a id="FNanchor_3253" href="#Footnote_3253" class="fnanchor">3253</a> with cliffs ‘ten to thirty feet high’.<a id="FNanchor_3254" href="#Footnote_3254" class="fnanchor">3254</a> He maintains
that our interpretation of the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angustis montibus</i> ‘must be
guided by consideration of the character of place under which an
officer would think of attempting to land’, and ‘must also depend
upon the possibility of aiming a javelin from the heights’. ‘Both
considerations,’ he insists, ‘exclude such lofty cliffs as those of
Dover and Folkestone.’<a id="FNanchor_3255" href="#Footnote_3255" class="fnanchor">3255</a> One might have expected that a man
so clever as Airy would have perceived that Caesar never intended
to land under <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angusti montes</i> at all, whether they were 300 or, as
Airy will have it, 10 feet high. He intended to land in the gap
between the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angusti montes</i>, that is to say, in Dover Harbour.<a id="FNanchor_3256" href="#Footnote_3256" class="fnanchor">3256</a>
Airy, indeed, contends that ‘neither Caesar nor Volusenus would
think for a moment of pushing his boats into a creek whose defenders
could attack them on both sides’;<a id="FNanchor_3257" href="#Footnote_3257" class="fnanchor">3257</a> but he forgets that Caesar
had reason to expect that his landing would not be opposed.<a id="FNanchor_3258" href="#Footnote_3258" class="fnanchor">3258</a> As
a matter of fact, Caesar says nothing about javelins; but if Airy
had stood on the beach at the foot of Dover cliffs and allowed an
army standing above to pelt him with missiles, he would have
speedily realized that it was possible to take aim from those ‘lofty
cliffs’; and, if he had survived the experiment, he would have been
a wiser and a sadder man.</p>

<p>2. Lewin<a id="FNanchor_3259" href="#Footnote_3259" class="fnanchor">3259</a> says that ‘if we assume that Caesar was wholly ignorant
of the British coast ... he could not have discovered the level
at Deal’.</p>

<p>But what is the use of making absurd assumptions? As we have
already seen, it is certain that before Caesar set foot in Britain he
knew everything about the coast of East Kent that Volusenus could
tell him.<a id="FNanchor_3260" href="#Footnote_3260" class="fnanchor">3260</a></p>

<p>3. It has been objected that the distance from Dover to Walmer
exceeds the seven miles which separated Caesar’s anchorage from
his landing-place. But no sensible man maintains that Caesar
anchored exactly opposite Dover Harbour. He anchored off the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_653">653</span>
cliffs east of Dover. He says that he sailed ‘<i>about</i> seven miles’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circiter milia passuum VII</i><a id="FNanchor_3261" href="#Footnote_3261" class="fnanchor">3261</a>) to his landing-place. The distance
by sea from off Dover to a point just north of Walmer Castle is 7½
English miles, or a little less than 8⅛ Roman miles; from off the
South Foreland to the same point 4⅞ English miles, or a little more
than 5¼ Roman miles. Accordingly, if we assume that Caesar’s
landing-place extended for about one mile north of Walmer Castle,
and that his anchorage extended eastward for about one mile towards
the South Foreland from a point about one mile east of
Dover, the requirements of the <cite>Commentaries</cite> are satisfied absolutely;
and even if the ship on the left of the line anchored just east of the
harbour, off the Castle cliff, Caesar’s rough estimate, which he
qualified by the word ‘about’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circiter</i>), is hardly violated. Surely
the difference between ‘about seven’ and 8⅙ is not worth cavilling
over.<a id="FNanchor_3262" href="#Footnote_3262" class="fnanchor">3262</a></p>

<p>4. Lewin<a id="FNanchor_3263" href="#Footnote_3263" class="fnanchor">3263</a> maintains that the beach at Deal does not correspond
with Caesar’s account of his disembarkation. The Romans, he
argues, evidently landed on a gradually shelving shore; whereas
‘at Deal the beach ... descends so steeply that with a three hours’
flood transports can come up to the water’s edge’.<a id="FNanchor_3264" href="#Footnote_3264" class="fnanchor">3264</a> Again, remarking
that Caesar describes the shore on which he landed as ‘open’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apertum</i>)
and ‘level’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">planum</i>), he says that ‘between Walmer and
Deal ... the ground is uneven, and cannot be called flat’. Lastly,
he recalls the witnesses whose evidence he had cited in support of
his own theory. ‘Caesar, Dion Cassius, Plutarch, and Valerius
Maximus, all ... refer to the <i>marshes</i> at the place of landing ... who
has ever heard of a marsh at Deal.’<a id="FNanchor_3265" href="#Footnote_3265" class="fnanchor">3265</a> And again, ‘Valerius Maximus
speaks of <i>two small islands</i> at the landing-place.... It was never
suggested that islands did exist or could have existed at Deal.’<a id="FNanchor_3266" href="#Footnote_3266" class="fnanchor">3266</a></p>

<p>Now, to begin with, Lewin assumes that the beach between
Walmer and Deal has undergone no change, and was as steep 2,000
years ago as it is to-day. In a previous article<a id="FNanchor_3267" href="#Footnote_3267" class="fnanchor">3267</a> I have shown that
this assumption is untenable. Secondly, Lewin misunderstands
Caesar’s narrative. As some of the Britons threw their missiles
from the shore,<a id="FNanchor_3268" href="#Footnote_3268" class="fnanchor">3268</a> it is evident that the deep water<a id="FNanchor_3269" href="#Footnote_3269" class="fnanchor">3269</a> in which the
Roman ships grounded was within the range of a sling or of an
arrow, that is to say, quite close to the shore. Thirdly, no shore is
or could conceivably be ‘level’: the shore between Walmer and
Deal is, as anybody may satisfy himself by the evidence of his own
eyes, free from obstructions<a id="FNanchor_3270" href="#Footnote_3270" class="fnanchor">3270</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apertum</i>) and, speaking generally,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_654">654</span>
evenly shelving (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">planum</i>)<a id="FNanchor_3271" href="#Footnote_3271" class="fnanchor">3271</a>. Caesar applied these epithets to the
shore on which he ran his ships aground, not to ‘the ground’ behind
it. As to the arguments which Lewin bases upon the statements
of Plutarch, Dion Cassius, and Valerius Maximus, I have already
shown<a id="FNanchor_3272" href="#Footnote_3272" class="fnanchor">3272</a> that they are worthless; but if the story told by Valerius
Maximus were worth anything, it would not support, but destroy
Lewin’s theory. For, as we have seen, Valerius Maximus<a id="FNanchor_3273" href="#Footnote_3273" class="fnanchor">3273</a> speaks
not of ‘two small islands’ but of one large island (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Britannica insula</i>),
and a rock (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scopulus</i>); and there are no rocks off Hythe or Lympne.<a id="FNanchor_3274" href="#Footnote_3274" class="fnanchor">3274</a>
Moreover, although the fact is of no consequence, there <i>are</i> rocks,
called the ‘Malms’, which are visible at low water, during spring
tides, opposite Deal;<a id="FNanchor_3275" href="#Footnote_3275" class="fnanchor">3275</a> and in the time of Caesar there were marshes
behind the sand-hills north of Deal.</p>

<p>5. General Creuly,<a id="FNanchor_3276" href="#Footnote_3276" class="fnanchor">3276</a> referring to Caesar’s description of the storm
by which some of his cavalry transports, after they were descried
from his camp in 55 <small>B.C.</small>, were driven further down the coast,<a id="FNanchor_3277" href="#Footnote_3277" class="fnanchor">3277</a>
maintains that the only point to which they could have been driven
was Dungeness. It follows, he says, that the camp could not have
been at Deal; for its distance from Dungeness is far too great.</p>

<p>The answer to this curious argument is, first, that it is plainly
impossible to indicate the exact point to which the ships were driven;
secondly, that it was certainly not Dungeness, for Dungeness did not
exist in Caesar’s time;<a id="FNanchor_3278" href="#Footnote_3278" class="fnanchor">3278</a> thirdly, that there is nothing in Caesar’s
narrative to show how far the point to which the ships were driven
was from his camp; and, fourthly, that if the camp was at or near
Deal, there is nothing in his narrative to show that the ships could
not have run before the gale as far as the longitude of Dungeness, or
even a good deal further. From Deal to Dungeness is only about
28 nautical miles; and if the ships approached the British coast in
the morning,<a id="FNanchor_3279" href="#Footnote_3279" class="fnanchor">3279</a> they would have had the greater part of the day in
which to make the run.</p>

<p>6. General Creuly<a id="FNanchor_3280" href="#Footnote_3280" class="fnanchor">3280</a> calls attention to the passage, which I have
already more than once quoted, in which Caesar tells us that at
daybreak, on his second voyage, he ‘saw Britain lying behind on
the port-quarter’. If, says the general, Caesar had steered for
Deal, he would have had the coast of Britain on the port side throughout
the voyage, and there would have been no point in the words
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub sinistra</i>. He insists that these words are simply the correlative
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">longius</i>: Caesar saw Britain on the left because the flood had
carried him <i>too far</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_655">655</span></p>

<p>It will be remembered that Appach used this passage to prove
that Caesar landed in the (assumed) Bay of Appledore.<a id="FNanchor_3281" href="#Footnote_3281" class="fnanchor">3281</a> Creuly
uses it to prove that Caesar landed near Hythe. I have shown the
futility of Appach’s argument; and to answer Appach is to answer
Creuly. I may remark, however, that Caesar does not merely say
that he saw Britain ‘on the left’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub sinistra</i>): he says that he
saw it ‘<i>lying behind</i> on the left’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub sinistra relictam</i>). The coast
could not have been described as ‘lying behind on the left’ until
after Caesar had passed the South Foreland;<a id="FNanchor_3282" href="#Footnote_3282" class="fnanchor">3282</a> and, although he
was steering not for Hythe, but for some point on the coast of East
Kent, the flood tide did carry him ‘too far’.</p>

<p>7. Many commentators have argued that Caesar’s account of the
last stage of his second voyage is inconsistent with the theory that
he landed near Deal. It will be remembered that, after telling us
that ‘he saw Britain lying behind on the port quarter’, he goes on
to say that he then followed the turn of the tide, and that all his
ships reached the landing-place by rowing towards midday. The
tide which he followed was of course the westward stream: strictly
speaking, its direction, if he had drifted to some point east of the
Goodwin Sands, was south-west<a id="FNanchor_3283" href="#Footnote_3283" class="fnanchor">3283</a> (magnetic), or between south-west
by south and south-south-west (true). It is very doubtful,
Lewin thinks, whether, with a current running at the rate of 3¾
miles an hour, the fleet could, by the mere use of oars, have reached
Deal at all; and it is certain that, in order to do so, it would have
been necessary to steer ‘across, if not actually against the current’.
Caesar ‘could not’, Lewin concludes, ‘be said to follow the tide
when he was steering athwart it. Besides, as it must necessarily
have been almost low water when the tide turned, had he held on
for Deal he would infallibly have struck on the Goodwin Sands.’<a id="FNanchor_3284" href="#Footnote_3284" class="fnanchor">3284</a>
Airy, on the other hand, asserts that Caesar ‘must have been cast
upon the Goodwin Sands’ during the drift.<a id="FNanchor_3285" href="#Footnote_3285" class="fnanchor">3285</a></p>

<p>Now the reader will have already perceived that if Lewin’s argument
tells against the view that Caesar landed near Deal, it is fatal
to the view which Lewin himself defends. For Lewin’s theory
compels him to assume that Caesar had drifted no further than
a point off the South Foreland:<a id="FNanchor_3286" href="#Footnote_3286" class="fnanchor">3286</a> in order to reach Hythe he would
have had to row less than thirteen nautical miles, with the stream
throughout; and it is therefore not easy to understand why his
rowers should have been called upon to make any extraordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_656">656</span>
efforts. This point he ignores. Again, he admits, or rather insists,
that Caesar must have drifted as far as the South Foreland; but
it is easy to demonstrate that if Caesar had been steering for Hythe,
he could not have drifted so far. For, as Lewin himself says, the
length of the drift must, in that case, have been not less than twelve
nautical miles.<a id="FNanchor_3287" href="#Footnote_3287" class="fnanchor">3287</a> Now the drift only lasted from about midnight
till daybreak; and, assuming that it lasted four hours&mdash;a liberal
estimate&mdash;the stream actually travelled, at the most, nine miles:<a id="FNanchor_3288" href="#Footnote_3288" class="fnanchor">3288</a>
of course the ships would not have travelled so far if they had merely
drifted,<a id="FNanchor_3289" href="#Footnote_3289" class="fnanchor">3289</a> but the faint breeze, without which they would not have
had steerage-way,<a id="FNanchor_3290" href="#Footnote_3290" class="fnanchor">3290</a> may have made up the deficit. But, in order to
give Lewin every chance, let us accept the most favourable of three
estimates with which he himself supplies us. He says<a id="FNanchor_3291" href="#Footnote_3291" class="fnanchor">3291</a> that ‘the
greatest velocity of the tide is, according to the Tidal Tables, 3.3
knots an hour.... The drift would, of course, be less than the velocity....
From midnight till daybreak at 4 a.m., would, therefore,
give a drift of twelve miles’. But Caesar’s voyage took place on
or about the 7th of July;<a id="FNanchor_3292" href="#Footnote_3292" class="fnanchor">3292</a> and daybreak was about 3.15 a.m. This
consideration alone compels us to reduce Lewin’s estimate to ten
miles and a half; and, moreover, he forgets that the tide never
runs for four consecutive hours, much less for the last four hours,
at its greatest velocity.<a id="FNanchor_3293" href="#Footnote_3293" class="fnanchor">3293</a> Thus the argument upon which he relies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_657">657</span>
to prove that Caesar must have landed at Hythe turns and pulverizes
his already shattered theory.</p>

<p>On the hypothesis that Caesar landed anywhere between Walmer
and Sandwich, the statement that he ‘followed the turn of the
stream’ presents no difficulty unless he meant that from the time
when the tide turned until the time when he reached Britain his
men were rowing hard exactly in the direction of the stream. This
is what Lewin assumes. But Caesar says no such thing. What he
says is that, having followed the turn of the tide, he rowed hard in
order to gain the desired landing-place. So long as the tide served,
hard rowing was obviously unnecessary,&mdash;if the Goodwin Sands
existed. In that case the true explanation is a modification of that
offered by C. Schneider,<a id="FNanchor_3294" href="#Footnote_3294" class="fnanchor">3294</a> who says, ‘As long as it was possible to
follow the turn of the tide, rowing was unnecessary. But after they
had reached a point where they could do so no longer without being
carried past their destination, they took to rowing.’ Of course they
would not have trusted to the current alone at any time; but,
supposing that the Goodwin Sands then existed or that an island
occupied their site, they travelled south-westward with the current
until they had turned the obstacle, and then rowed hard in a north-westerly
direction, across the current,<a id="FNanchor_3295" href="#Footnote_3295" class="fnanchor">3295</a> till they reached the landing
place.<a id="FNanchor_3296" href="#Footnote_3296" class="fnanchor">3296</a></p>

<p>The question of the Goodwin Sands has been discussed in an
earlier part of this book.<a id="FNanchor_3297" href="#Footnote_3297" class="fnanchor">3297</a> Either they did not exist in the time of
Caesar, the substratum on which they rest being covered by the
sea; or they did exist, but had not accumulated to their present
height, or perhaps to their present extent; or they were virtually
identical with the present sands, though their limits, which are not
constant, may not have been the same as they are now; or, finally,
as Sir Charles Lyell suggested, their place may have been occupied
by an island. The question cannot be positively settled; but, for
reasons which I have already given, I am rather inclined to believe
that either Sir Charles Lyell’s suggestion was right, or the sands
had accumulated sufficiently to be visible, or at all events dangerous,
at certain points at low water. I shall, however, presently take
account of the possibility that neither of these alternatives is true.</p>

<p>Much depends upon the answer which is to be given to the question,
To what point had Caesar drifted when he saw the coast of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_658">658</span>
Britain? Heller argues that this point must have been about nine
miles due east of Ramsgate; but, as I have shown in the previous
article, his reasoning is unsound.<a id="FNanchor_3298" href="#Footnote_3298" class="fnanchor">3298</a> If Caesar had drifted to the
point which Heller indicates, his course to Deal, where, according
to Heller, he disembarked, would have been nearly south-west,
that is to say, nearly identical with the direction of the Gull Stream,
which is described in the Admiralty Tide Tables as SW. ½ W.
(magnetic), or, approximately, SW. by S. true.<a id="FNanchor_3299" href="#Footnote_3299" class="fnanchor">3299</a> But, on this hypothesis,
it would be inexplicable that his soldiers were obliged to row
hard. Heller, indeed, conjectures that Caesar steered for the nearest
point of the coast, that is to say, nearly due west, intending to keep
close inshore until he found the landing-place; and he remarks
that this would explain why his men were obliged to use their oars
instead of committing themselves to the stream alone.<a id="FNanchor_3300" href="#Footnote_3300" class="fnanchor">3300</a> But Caesar
must have known the whereabouts of his landing-place; and Heller’s
explanation seems to be far-fetched. Besides, as I shall presently
show, Caesar, on his second expedition, did not land between Walmer
and Deal, but in the neighbourhood of Sandwich.</p>

<p>For reasons which I have given in the article on the Portus Itius<a id="FNanchor_3301" href="#Footnote_3301" class="fnanchor">3301</a>
I think we must conclude with Napoleon the Third,<a id="FNanchor_3302" href="#Footnote_3302" class="fnanchor">3302</a> that Caesar
could hardly have drifted much further than a point on the latitude
of Deal and east of the Goodwin Sands. When the tide turned soon
after daybreak&mdash;about 4.30 a.m., if, as is probable, the day was the
7th of July<a id="FNanchor_3303" href="#Footnote_3303" class="fnanchor">3303</a>&mdash;he would have dropped down with the ebb as I have
already explained. If, after he had passed the sands or the island, he
had waited till about 9.30 a.m., the stream would have turned, and
have begun to flow NE. ½ N.<a id="FNanchor_3304" href="#Footnote_3304" class="fnanchor">3304</a> magnetic, or, approximately, NNE.
true: if he had not waited, he would have had to row hard, as I
have shown above,<a id="FNanchor_3305" href="#Footnote_3305" class="fnanchor">3305</a> athwart a stream which was flowing at a rate
varying from three to two knots, until it turned about 9.30.</p>

<p>The objection that, during the drift, Caesar ‘must have been
cast upon the Goodwin Sands’ is as groundless as the objection,
which has just been met, that if he had attempted to row to Deal
[or to the coast between Sandown Castle and Sandwich] ‘he would
infallibly have struck upon the Goodwin Sands’.<a id="FNanchor_3306" href="#Footnote_3306" class="fnanchor">3306</a> Captain Iron,
the harbour-master of Dover, traced out upon the chart in my
presence the course which the Roman flotilla would naturally have
steered from Boulogne, and showed that, after the south-west wind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_659">659</span>
dropped, it would have drifted east of the Sands. If, as is probable,
the flat-bottomed vessels had made so much lee-way that, even
before the wind dropped, they had got a little out of their course,
they would have drifted still further eastward. It may also be
objected that if Caesar, after he had followed the tide south-westward,
had turned the sands or the island which may have occupied
their place, he would have mentioned the fact. The objection
would be quite natural if it came from a writer who had merely
‘got up’ so much of Caesar’s narrative as he thought would be
necessary to enable him to study the question; but every one who
is really familiar with the <cite>Commentaries</cite> knows that Caesar often
omitted to mention matters, especially geographical, which a modern
historian would feel bound to record. There remains the possibility&mdash;perhaps
the probability&mdash;that neither the Goodwin Sands nor
the hypothetical island then existed. In this case Caesar would
have had to row across the current: still he might fairly have said
that he followed the turn of the tide. He was bound for Britain,
and could not begin to row until the tide began to set towards
Britain, though in a different direction from his: what other expression
could he have used than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aestus commutationem secutus</i>? Lewin
doubted whether he could have reached Britain by rowing at all;
but Lewin did not understand what he was writing about, and ought
to have consulted a treatise on practical navigation.<a id="FNanchor_3307" href="#Footnote_3307" class="fnanchor">3307</a> On the other
hand, it might possibly be objected that he would not have taken
till noon to reach his destination: that depends upon the exact
direction of the current, which often varies from the direction
indicated in the <cite>Admiralty Tide Tables</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_3308" href="#Footnote_3308" class="fnanchor">3308</a> and upon the rate at which
the vessels could have been rowed in still water. What he says is
that <i>all</i> his ships reached Britain by about noon; and doubtless
there were stragglers. Of course it may be argued that there were
not, and that all the ships were actually rowed for seven hours.
But if any one thinks that the possible objection which I have
anticipated is valid he will find himself confronted by another
which is absolutely insuperable. For he must needs accept Lewin’s
alternative theory, to which the objection would apply with redoubled
force,&mdash;that Caesar took seven hours to row from a point
off the South Foreland (though he could not have drifted so far)
to Hythe; in other words, that <i>by rowing hard Caesar could only
manage to travel two knots an hour with the stream</i>; and that <i>he took
twice as long to row less than thirteen knots with the stream as he had
taken to drift twelve knots without rowing</i>!</p>

<p>8. Airy,<a id="FNanchor_3309" href="#Footnote_3309" class="fnanchor">3309</a> remarking that it is evident from the <cite>Commentaries</cite> that
‘there were forests and cornfields near’ the Roman camp, maintains,
first, that if Caesar had landed near Deal ‘he would have
had for seven miles all round his camp bare chalk-downs, on which
in those days there probably was neither a tree nor a ploughed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_660">660</span>
field’; secondly, that a night march, such as that which Caesar
made after he landed in 54 <small>B.C.</small>, can only be made upon good roads;
that ‘the roads in a woodland and clay-ground country are almost
invariable’; that accordingly the roads of East Kent ‘are in the
very same tracks as in the days of Julius Caesar’; and that Caesar’s
night march, the length of which was 12 Roman miles, would have
brought him to the marshes of the Stour, whereas, if the Britons
had been posted on that river, he would have crossed it ‘at the
sound ground of Canterbury or above it, and would have attacked
their flank’; and thirdly, that if Caesar’s march to the point where
he crossed the Thames had begun near Deal, ‘his course would
have been all the way parallel to the Thames, and the expression
“ad Tamesin”<a id="FNanchor_3310" href="#Footnote_3310" class="fnanchor">3310</a> could scarcely have been used.’</p>

<p>The first of these objections is summarily disposed of by Long,<a id="FNanchor_3311" href="#Footnote_3311" class="fnanchor">3311</a>
who points out that at Worth, between Deal and Sandwich, there
is ‘some of the best wheat land in England’; and by Dr. Guest,<a id="FNanchor_3312" href="#Footnote_3312" class="fnanchor">3312</a>
who remarks that ‘the uplands round Deal are every autumn white
with corn’;<a id="FNanchor_3313" href="#Footnote_3313" class="fnanchor">3313</a> and that, as many of the great forests which once
existed in England have disappeared, the absence of woods in the
neighbourhood of Deal is no proof that there were none there in
Caesar’s time. But, as a matter of fact, there are no less than five
woods at distances varying from about a mile to three miles and
a quarter from Upper Deal;<a id="FNanchor_3314" href="#Footnote_3314" class="fnanchor">3314</a> and Caesar only speaks of one wood
as having existed in the neighbourhood of his camp, and implies
that it was a considerable distance off.<a id="FNanchor_3315" href="#Footnote_3315" class="fnanchor">3315</a> The second objection is
valid against the theory that Caesar landed between Walmer and
Deal <i>on his second expedition</i>, unless he encountered the Britons on
the Little Stour; but I shall presently show that on that occasion
he landed near Sandwich, and that his march of ‘about twelve
miles’ did bring him either to ‘the sound ground of Canterbury or
above it’, or to Fordwich or Sturry below Canterbury, but of course
not to ‘the marshes of the Stour’. The third objection, from the
point of view of Airy, according to whom Caesar landed at Pevensey,
may to some minds appear plausible; but the view that Caesar
landed at Pevensey is out of the question. But the same objection
has been urged by the advocates of Hythe; and they hardly deserve
an answer. Supposing Caesar’s march had been nearly parallel
with the Thames, what then? If he had landed at or near Hythe,
he must have first encountered the Britons at Wye on the Stour;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_661">661</span>
and from Wye to Brentford<a id="FNanchor_3316" href="#Footnote_3316" class="fnanchor">3316</a> his march would have been hardly
less parallel (if the expression may be pardoned) to the Thames
than from the neighbourhood of Sandwich. In writing the words
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad Tamesim</i> he simply intended to indicate approximately the
distance from his naval camp, either to the point where he crossed
the Thames or to the nearest frontier of the territory of Cassivellaunus;
and the direction of his march is nothing to the purpose.
Whether that direction was nearly parallel to the Thames or at
right angles to it, the distance was about 80 Roman miles.</p>

<p>9. It will be remembered that at the close of Caesar’s second
campaign his camp was attacked by the four chieftains of Kent.<a id="FNanchor_3317" href="#Footnote_3317" class="fnanchor">3317</a>
General Creuly argues that if the camp had been at Deal, Caesar,
when he was marching to the place where he crossed the Thames,
must have traversed the country of the four chieftains without
having first subdued them. If, on the other hand, says the general,
he had started from Hythe, he would have marched not through
the heart of their territory, but close to their frontier; and for this
very reason they would not have thought it necessary to submit.<a id="FNanchor_3318" href="#Footnote_3318" class="fnanchor">3318</a></p>

<p>Heller<a id="FNanchor_3319" href="#Footnote_3319" class="fnanchor">3319</a> has taken the trouble to answer this nebulous argument.
He points out that Caesar, having defeated the chieftains in the
engagements which immediately followed his arrival, evidently did
not think them sufficiently dangerous to wait until he had secured
their complete submission. Indeed, if their territory comprised the
whole of Kent, or even that part of it which lies east of Maidstone, it
is evident that Caesar, marching northward from Hythe to the Stour,
and then turning westward or north-westward, would have traversed
the heart of their country. Moreover, as Heller might have added,
it would have been just as hazardous for Caesar to leave the chiefs
unsubdued if he had marched from Hythe as if he had marched
from the neighbourhood of Deal or of Sandwich. Furthermore, he
had no time to spare; and unless he had completely laid waste their
country, and treated their people with the ruthless severity with
which he afterwards treated the Eburones<a id="FNanchor_3320" href="#Footnote_3320" class="fnanchor">3320</a>&mdash;and to do this would
have required the greater part of the time which he had to spend in
Britain&mdash;it would have been utterly impossible for him to subdue
them so thoroughly as to prevent them from attacking his camp
in his absence. Think of the Boers!</p>

<p>10. Lastly, it has been objected<a id="FNanchor_3321" href="#Footnote_3321" class="fnanchor">3321</a> that Caesar could not have
landed near Deal, or indeed at any point on the coast of East Kent,
because, if he had marched against Cassivellaunus from that neighbourhood,
he must have passed through tracts abounding in beech-woods,
whereas he says expressly that there were no beech-trees in
Britain.<a id="FNanchor_3322" href="#Footnote_3322" class="fnanchor">3322</a> But Dr. Guest<a id="FNanchor_3323" href="#Footnote_3323" class="fnanchor">3323</a> disposed of this objection by pointing
out that ‘at whatever point on the south coast Caesar landed ...
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_662">662</span>
he must have crossed the North Downs on his way to the Thames,
and so have passed through “tracts abounding in beech-woods”’.
Mr. Mackinder,<a id="FNanchor_3324" href="#Footnote_3324" class="fnanchor">3324</a> indeed, asserts, without giving any authority, that
the beech was introduced into this country by the Romans; but it
has been found in submerged forests and in deposits of the Bronze
Age.<a id="FNanchor_3325" href="#Footnote_3325" class="fnanchor">3325</a> If by the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fagum</i> Caesar meant the beech, his statement
was incorrect.<a id="FNanchor_3326" href="#Footnote_3326" class="fnanchor">3326</a></p>

<h3 id="PII_Pg662">XII. THE THEORY THAT CAESAR LANDED AT
RICHBOROUGH OR SANDWICH</h3>

<p>The commentators who believe that Caesar landed in the neighbourhood
of Sandwich are not agreed among themselves. Napoleon III,
who holds that he landed between Walmer and Deal in 55, and at
or near Sandwich in 54 <small>B.C.</small>, argues that the disaster which befell
his ships on the night of the full moon in August, 55 <small>B.C.</small>, must have
taught him the danger to which they would be exposed on the beach
near Deal, and that accordingly he must have selected a better
landing-place ‘some kilometres further north’.<a id="FNanchor_3327" href="#Footnote_3327" class="fnanchor">3327</a> Others, like the
late George Dowker, maintain that he landed near Sandwich on
both occasions.</p>

<p>Dowker assumes that Caesar’s own ship, if not the rest of his fleet,
anchored in 55 <small>B.C.</small> off the South Foreland; and he goes on to say
that ‘from the South Foreland ... seven miles would bring him near
the mouth of Sandwich Haven’. He decides for Sandwich instead
of Deal because, in his opinion, the <cite>Commentaries</cite> show that Caesar
landed ‘at or near a point whence he could get his long vessels on the
flank of an enemy’, and at Deal ‘no such bay existed’, whereas at
Sandwich the very bay which he wanted was formed by the mouth
of the Stour.<a id="FNanchor_3328" href="#Footnote_3328" class="fnanchor">3328</a></p>

<p>That Caesar did ‘get his long vessels on the flank of an enemy’<a id="FNanchor_3329" href="#Footnote_3329" class="fnanchor">3329</a>
is unquestionable: but he does not say that he placed them in a bay
or in the mouth of the Stour or any other river; nor is it easy to
understand why a bay or the mouth of a river should have been
necessary for his purpose. The object of placing the ‘long vessels’
on the enemy’s right flank was that the artillerymen, slingers, and
archers who manned them might drive away the enemy who were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_663">663</span>
trying to stop the disembarkation; and some of the enemy were
standing on the shore, while the rest were wading, or mounted on
horseback, or perhaps standing in their cars in the sea close to the
water’s edge.<a id="FNanchor_3330" href="#Footnote_3330" class="fnanchor">3330</a> Why should not the ‘long vessels’ have been in
the sea too? What was to be gained by sending them into the
mouth of a river? When Dowker said that a run of 7 miles would
have brought Caesar from the South Foreland nearly to ‘the mouth
of Sandwich Haven’, his eagerness to prove his point prevented him
from making an accurate measurement. From the South Foreland
to the place which was once the mouth of Sandwich Haven, as
measured within half a mile from the shore on Sheet 290 of the One
Inch Ordnance Map, is just over 11 statute, or 12 Roman miles.
Nor does Battely contribute much to the argument when he pleads
that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">VIII milia passuum</i> ‘does not occur invariably in all the editions’,
and that Caesar may have made a mistake. We are not concerned
with ‘the editions’, but with the <i>MSS.</i>; and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">VIII milia passuum</i>
does not occur in any of them, but <i>VII</i> (or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">septem</i>) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">milia passuum</i>
in all.<a id="FNanchor_3331" href="#Footnote_3331" class="fnanchor">3331</a> It would be strange if Caesar had not made a slight mistake;
but it would be stranger still if he had mistaken twelve miles for
seven. Battely<a id="FNanchor_3332" href="#Footnote_3332" class="fnanchor">3332</a> argues that he must have landed at Richborough,
(<i>a</i>) because he says that Cantium, where the Gauls generally landed,
has an easterly aspect, whereas Dover looks south; (<i>b</i>) because
Dion’s description of the landing-place, ‘which, as to the nature
of the shore, directly contradicts Caesar’s narrative,’ is applicable
to Richborough, where there ‘was a marshy and muddy shore, on
which Caesar’s soldiers ... could not keep their footing’;<a id="FNanchor_3333" href="#Footnote_3333" class="fnanchor">3333</a> and
(<i>c</i>) because ‘all the time the Romans were masters of our island,
Rutupiae ... was the only port where they disembarked’. Now
Caesar, who never talks nonsense, does not say that the whole of
Cantium, or even that part of it in which the Gauls used to land,
faces the east. He merely says that of the side of Britain which
faces Gaul ‘one corner, by Kent&mdash;the part which almost all ships
from Gaul make for&mdash;has an easterly ... aspect’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">huius lateris alter
angulus, qui est ad Cantium, quo fere omnes ex Gallia naves adpelluntur,
ad orientem solem ... spectat</i><a id="FNanchor_3334" href="#Footnote_3334" class="fnanchor">3334</a>). Besides, nobody would argue that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_664">664</span>
Caesar landed at Dover; and the coast between Walmer and Deal
has an easterly aspect no less than Richborough. Secondly, when
Battely says that Dion’s description of the landing-place ‘directly
contradicts’ Caesar’s narrative, and then elects to believe the
inaccurate and rhetorical Greek, who wrote two hundred years
after the event, rather than the eye-witness, he shows that he is
incapable of serious criticism. Besides, it is not true that Dion’s
description of the landing-place<a id="FNanchor_3335" href="#Footnote_3335" class="fnanchor">3335</a> contradicts Caesar’s narrative either
directly or indirectly; and neither of them says that the shore was
either ‘marshy’ or ‘muddy’.<a id="FNanchor_3336" href="#Footnote_3336" class="fnanchor">3336</a> Thirdly, Rutupiae was not ‘the
only port’ where the Romans disembarked after they had become
masters of the island. It is certain that Dover Harbour was in use
during the Roman occupation of Britain, for it is mentioned in the
<cite>Itinerary</cite> of Antonine;<a id="FNanchor_3337" href="#Footnote_3337" class="fnanchor">3337</a> inscribed tiles found at Dover prove that
it was one of the stations of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Classis Britannica</i>,<a id="FNanchor_3338" href="#Footnote_3338" class="fnanchor">3338</a>&mdash;the Roman
‘Channel Fleet’; and the mere fact that two disembarkations
after the time of Caesar are recorded to have taken place at Rutupiae<a id="FNanchor_3339" href="#Footnote_3339" class="fnanchor">3339</a>
does not prove the contrary.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that Caesar, on his first voyage, did not land
either in the neighbourhood of Sandwich or at Richborough, and
that he did land between Walmer and Deal. The disembarkation
must of course have taken place along a front of considerable extent;
and the most southerly point at which it would have been easily
practicable is quite close to Walmer Castle.</p>

<p>In the following year, however, the fleet must have made the land
somewhere between the site of Deal Castle and the latitude of
Sandwich. For the Romans, as we have seen, on the morning after
their disembarkation, fought a cavalry action on the banks of
a river, at a spot about twelve miles from the camp which Caesar
had constructed near the place of landing: the river, as we shall
afterwards see,<a id="FNanchor_3340" href="#Footnote_3340" class="fnanchor">3340</a> was the Stour; and if the length of the march was
estimated with tolerable accuracy, the camp must have been in
the neighbourhood of Sandwich.<a id="FNanchor_3341" href="#Footnote_3341" class="fnanchor">3341</a> Besides, Caesar tells us that ‘he
felt little anxiety for the ships, as he was leaving them at anchor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_665">665</span>
on a nice open shore’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo minus veritus navibus, quod in litore molli
atque aperto deligatas ad ancoras relinquebat</i><a id="FNanchor_3342" href="#Footnote_3342" class="fnanchor">3342</a>). The meaning of the
epithet, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mollis</i>, has been already explained;<a id="FNanchor_3343" href="#Footnote_3343" class="fnanchor">3343</a> and, moreover,
although no commentator has noticed the fact, it does not need
much acumen to see that Caesar was here excusing himself for having
left his ships at anchor, in spite of the severe lesson which the storm
of the previous year had given him, by the plea that he had selected
a more favourable anchorage.<a id="FNanchor_3344" href="#Footnote_3344" class="fnanchor">3344</a></p>

<p>I began this inquiry early in 1900 with a mind absolutely unbiassed,
resolved to do one of two things,&mdash;either to solve the
problem, or, if that could not be done, to show, once for all, that
it was insoluble. The reader knows that I have not neglected any
means of ascertaining the truth; and I have provided him with
the means of controlling every statement which I have made. I have
set down fully and fairly the arguments of those from whom I differ;
and I have kept back nothing, I have called attention to everything,
that might appear to tell against the conclusion to which the evidence
inevitably led. I need not say anything by way of recapitulation,
for no man who has read this article attentively can be lacking
either in patience or in intelligence; and I am sure that the reader
is by this time convinced of these things:&mdash;that it has been demonstrated
that Caesar did not land at Pevensey, or anywhere in Sussex;
that it has been demonstrated that he did not land at Hythe, or
anywhere in Romney Marsh; and that it has been demonstrated
that he did land both in 55 and in 54 <small>B.C.</small> in East Kent,&mdash;in the
former year between Walmer Castle and Deal Castle, in the latter
north of Deal Castle. That some will still for a time dispute these
conclusions is likely enough; but not those whose judgements
count. For them the problem is solved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The following is a transcript of the report of Messrs. Doak, Hudson,

<p>‘The calculations have proved somewhat more lengthy and complicated than
was at first anticipated, since it was found on examination that no approximate
process would give results of a satisfactory degree of accuracy. In consequence
the following work has been done:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Twelve complete places of the Moon were determined from Hansen’s
“Tables de la Lune”, embodying all the inequalities. Longitude, Latitude,
and Parallax were thus obtained.</p>

<p>2. The Sun’s Longitude, the Obliquity of the Ecliptic and the Sidereal Time
were then computed from Newcomb’s Tables for seven successive Greenwich

but the resulting error cannot, in the opinion of Professor Newcomb, exceed
±30 seconds of arc, and is probably about ±12 seconds.</p>

<p>3. The Moon’s position was then converted from Longitude and Latitude to
Right Ascension and Declination.</p>

<p>4. The Greenwich Mean Time of Moon’s Transit was computed for twelve
transits.</p>

<p>5. The times of High Water at Dover were obtained by applying the proper
quantities from the Admiralty Tidal Curve for Dover to the times of Moon’s
Transit.</p>

<p>6. From the Longitudes of Moon and Sun the time of Full Moon was determined.</p>

<p>7. The whole of the calculations were then examined and duplicated where
desirable.</p>

<p>With the one exception of the Sun’s Longitude the calculations have been
rigorous, and, so far as the computing is concerned, are of the same degree of
accuracy as those published annually in the Nautical Almanac. A very slight
divergence from the truth is, however, possible owing to the fact that the tables
of the Moon and Sun are used for an epoch nineteen-and-a-half centuries ago;
but it is very unlikely that this is large enough to affect the times of high water
or of full moon.</p>

<h2 id="PII_Pg666">THE CREDIBILITY OF CAESAR’S NARRATIVE
OF HIS INVASIONS OF BRITAIN</h2>

<p>I have already published in <cite>Caesar’s Conquest of Gaul</cite> an essay upon
the credibility of Caesar’s <cite>Commentaries</cite>; but, as it only deals incidentally
with the invasions of Britain, I intend in this place to
examine certain charges which have been made against that section
of Caesar’s narrative. It has been objected, perhaps justly, to the
essay by competent critics in this country (though not on the Continent<a id="FNanchor_3345" href="#Footnote_3345" class="fnanchor">3345</a>)
that it devotes an undue amount of space to the refutation
of inferior writers; but at all events those who have read it will
believe that the charges which I leave unnoticed in the present article
may safely be disregarded.</p>

<p>I agree with Dr. F. Vogel that, apart from internal evidence,
virtually the only authority by which we can test the <cite>Commentaries</cite>
is the correspondence of Cicero; and the opinion which I have already
expressed of Dion Cassius<a id="FNanchor_3346" href="#Footnote_3346" class="fnanchor">3346</a> is supported by the German scholar.<a id="FNanchor_3347" href="#Footnote_3347" class="fnanchor">3347</a></p>

<p>1. Dr. Vogel points to a passage in one of Cicero’s letters to Atticus,<a id="FNanchor_3348" href="#Footnote_3348" class="fnanchor">3348</a>
which, he says, has not yet received due attention or been correctly
explained:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Britannici belli exitus exspectatur; constat enim aditus
insulae esse <em>muratos</em><a id="FNanchor_3349" href="#Footnote_3349" class="fnanchor">3349</a> mirificis molibus; etiam illud iam cognitum
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_667">667</span>
est, neque argenti scripulum esse ullum in illa insula neque ullam spem
praedae nisi ex mancipiis</i>, &amp;c. The following translation will be
generally accepted as accurate:&mdash;‘The result of the British war is
a source of anxiety. For it is notorious that the approaches to the
island are ramparted by astonishing masses of cliff; and, besides,
it is now known that there isn’t a pennyworth of silver in the island,
nor any hope of loot except from slaves.’ But Dr. Vogel insists that
the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Britannici belli exitus exspectatur</i> ‘can only mean “the end
of the British war is expected”, that is to say, it is expected that
the war, being too hazardous and too unremunerative, will be entirely
abandoned’.<a id="FNanchor_3350" href="#Footnote_3350" class="fnanchor">3350</a> The letter in question was written, as Dr. Vogel
remarks, before the 3rd of July, <small>A.U.C.</small> 700, that is to say, before the
8th of June of the Julian calendar.<a id="FNanchor_3351" href="#Footnote_3351" class="fnanchor">3351</a> He goes on to say that for some
time afterwards it must have continued an open question whether
the expedition was not to be given up; for in a letter written after
the 15th of July,<a id="FNanchor_3352" href="#Footnote_3352" class="fnanchor">3352</a> Cicero says to his brother, ‘I wish that you could
come at the time you arranged’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cuperem te ad id tempus venire quod
dixeras</i>). But, says Dr. Vogel, Caesar says not a word to show that
the proposed expedition was almost abandoned. Not a word
directly: but Dr. Vogel believes that he can detect a significant
hint in the <cite>Commentaries</cite>. Caesar relates that, before he sailed for
Britain, he was obliged to march into the country of the Treveri,
who were said to be preparing for rebellion. Soon after the legions
entered the country, Indutiomarus, the leader of the malcontents,
finding that resistance would, for the time being, be hopeless, sent
envoys to Caesar to assure him of his loyalty and to make excuses
for not having come in person to pay his respects. On which Caesar
remarks, ‘Caesar was aware of his motive for saying this, and of
the circumstances that deterred him from prosecuting the design
which he had formed: still, in order to avoid having to waste the
summer in the country of the Treveri after having made all his
preparations for a campaign in Britain, he told Indutiomarus to
present himself with two hundred hostages’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caesar, etsi intellegebat
qua de causa ea dicerentur quaeque eum res ab instituto consilio deterreret,
tamen, ne aestatem in Treveris consumere cogeretur omnibus ad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_668">668</span>
Britannicum bellum rebus comparatis, Indutiomarum ad se cum
ducentis obsidibus venire iussit</i><a id="FNanchor_3353" href="#Footnote_3353" class="fnanchor">3353</a>). Now, says Dr. Vogel, although
Caesar is silent as to his real motive, we may divine from the words
‘in order to avoid having to waste the summer in the country of
the Treveri after having made all his preparations for a campaign
in Britain’ that he hesitated for some time to carry out his resolve
of making a second British expedition.<a id="FNanchor_3354" href="#Footnote_3354" class="fnanchor">3354</a></p>

<p>This charge rests upon a mistranslation.<a id="FNanchor_3355" href="#Footnote_3355" class="fnanchor">3355</a> The words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Britannici
belli exitus exspectatur</i> will certainly bear the interpretation which
I have put upon them: why, then, suggest another interpretation,
which, even if it could be got out of the Latin, would necessitate
the assumption that Caesar did not know his own mind, and that,
after he had kept his army busy for six months building six hundred
ships, he told his staff that, all things considered, it would be better
not to make use of them, and presently changed his mind again,
and did make use of them? Again, in his quotation from Cicero’s
letter to Quintus, Dr. Vogel leaves out the important part. The
passage runs as follows:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qua re suavitatis equidem nostrae fruendae
causa cuperem te ad id tempus venire quod dixeras, sed illud malo tamen,
quod putas magis <em>e re tua; magis</em> ... illa etiam magni aestimo</i>, ἀμφιλαφίαν
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">illam tuam et explicationem debitorum tuorum</i>. Read Professor
Tyrrell’s translation:&mdash;‘Wherefore I should indeed wish that you
could come at the time you arranged, for the sake of our pleasure in
each other’s society; but yet I desire more that you should do what
you think your interests demand [and stay in the camp of Caesar];
still more do I value other considerations, your being in easy circumstances,
and free from embarrassments.’ Professor Tyrrell goes on
to point out that ‘the words printed in italics [<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">e re tua; magis</em>],
or some such words, must, as Wesenburg suggested, have fallen
out’,<a id="FNanchor_3356" href="#Footnote_3356" class="fnanchor">3356</a> &amp;c. As for Caesar’s words, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne aestatem in Treveris consumere
cogeretur omnibus ad Britannicum bellum rebus comparatis</i>, I confess
that my powers of divination are not equal to those of Dr. Vogel.
I am unable to infer from these words that Caesar hesitated for
a moment to carry out his matured resolve.</p>

<p>Dr. Vogel then calls our attention to the well-known letter in which
Cicero complained that he had had no news either from Quintus or
from Caesar for more than fifty days, by which he meant that the
last letters which he had received were <i>dated</i> more than fifty days
before the time at which he was himself writing.<a id="FNanchor_3357" href="#Footnote_3357" class="fnanchor">3357</a> Caesar’s last letter
had been written on the 1st of September, and Quintus’s apparently
a few days earlier.<a id="FNanchor_3358" href="#Footnote_3358" class="fnanchor">3358</a> On the 25th of September they both wrote
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_669">669</span>
again.<a id="FNanchor_3359" href="#Footnote_3359" class="fnanchor">3359</a> Dr. Vogel admits that from the 1st to the 25th Caesar and
Quintus were engaged in operations against Cassivellaunus. But,
he says, this does not satisfactorily explain the long break in the
arrival of letters. In order to understand it, one must take into
account a circumstance which Caesar himself relates,<a id="FNanchor_3360" href="#Footnote_3360" class="fnanchor">3360</a> but the
importance of which he minimizes, namely, that while he was campaigning
on the north of the Thames, the four kings of Kent made
an attack on his naval camp. It is true, says Dr. Vogel, that the
attack was repulsed; but what did the Roman success amount to?
All that Caesar can say for his troops is that they returned from their
sortie unhurt. How long, owing to this outbreak in Kent, the communication
between his army and his fleet was interrupted he tries
to conceal by the meaningless expression, ‘while the operations
above mentioned were going on in this district’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dum haec in his locis
geruntur</i><a id="FNanchor_3361" href="#Footnote_3361" class="fnanchor">3361</a>). As he goes on to say that Cassivellaunus, owing to the
failure of the attack on the naval camp, sent envoys, one may read
between the lines of his narrative that it was the action of the four
kings which induced him to accept the embassy, even if he did not
actually invite it.<a id="FNanchor_3362" href="#Footnote_3362" class="fnanchor">3362</a></p>

<p>To ‘read between the lines’ is always easy: the only difficulty is
to avoid reading what is not there. The reason for ‘the complete
break in the arrival of letters’ to which Dr. Vogel refers is intelligible
to any reader who is not determined to convict Caesar of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suppressio
veri</i>: the reason is either that, as I have elsewhere shown, Caesar
was engaged, first in marching back from the coast into the interior,
after a temporary visit to his naval camp, then in negotiations with
Cassivellaunus, and, finally, in leading his army back to the sea;
or, if he remained in his naval camp from the 1st to the 25th of
September,<a id="FNanchor_3363" href="#Footnote_3363" class="fnanchor">3363</a> that he saw no reason for writing to Cicero, or did not
think it worth while to send a ship to Gaul for the sole purpose of
conveying a letter. What Dr. Vogel calls ‘the meaningless expression’,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dum haec in his locis geruntur</i>, is one of a class of expressions,
all containing the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dum haec geruntur</i>, which Caesar uses
thirteen times:<a id="FNanchor_3364" href="#Footnote_3364" class="fnanchor">3364</a> like our ‘meanwhile’, it is doubtless wanting in
chronological precision, but it is not meaningless. Dr. Vogel asserts
that ‘the complete break in the arrival of letters’ was due to ‘the
outbreak in Kent’ on the part of the four kings. Yet he admits
that the attack which the four kings made on the naval camp was
repulsed; and Caesar adds that the garrison killed many of the
enemy, and captured their leader, Lugotorix. In other words, their
success was complete. All that they had to do was to beat off an
attack, and this they effectually did. Even assuming that ‘the
complete break in the arrival of letters’ was due to the action of the
four kings, what then? It was not Caesar’s business to chronicle
postal irregularities, but simply to describe his campaign.</p>

<p>To the very end of the narrative Dr. Vogel continues to read
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_670">670</span>
between the lines. ‘Thoroughly characteristic,’ he tells us, ‘is the
way in which Caesar describes the results of the expedition. It is
true that his account<a id="FNanchor_3365" href="#Footnote_3365" class="fnanchor">3365</a> substantially tallies with what Cicero writes
to Atticus,&mdash;“On the 24th of October I received letters from my
brother Quintus and from Caesar, dated from the nearest coasts of
Britain on the 25th of September. They had settled affairs in Britain,
received hostages, and imposed tribute, though they had got no
booty.” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A Quinto fratre et a Caesare accepti a. d. IX Kal. Nov. litteras,
datas a littoribus Britanniae proximis a. d. VI Kal. Octobr. Confecta
Britannia, obsidibus acceptis, nulla praeda, imperata tamen pecunia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_3366" href="#Footnote_3366" class="fnanchor">3366</a>
&amp;c.). But what about Cassivellaunus? How did Caesar balance
accounts with him?’ Dr. Vogel reminds us that Caesar’s words
have led Mommsen to believe that Cassivellaunus promised to pay
tribute and to give hostages. But, says Dr. Vogel, Caesar nowhere
says this: he only leads the reader to imagine it. What he says is
this:&mdash;‘On receiving news of the action [namely, the repulse of the
four kings], Cassivellaunus, who was greatly alarmed by the defection
of the tribes, following the numerous disasters which he had sustained
and the ravaging of his country, availed himself of the mediation of
the Atrebatian, Commius, and sent envoys to Caesar, to propose
surrender. Caesar had resolved to winter on the Continent because
disturbances had broken out suddenly in Gaul: not much of the
summer remained; and the enemy, as he knew, could easily spin
out the time. Accordingly he ordered hostages to be given, and
fixed the tribute which Britain was to pay annually to the Roman
People, at the same time expressly forbidding Cassivellaunus to
molest Mandubracius or the Trinovantes.’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cassivellaunus, hoc
proelio nuntiato, tot detrimentis acceptis, vastatis finibus, maxime
etiam permotus defectione civitatum, legatos per Atrebatem Commium
de deditione ad Caesarem mittit. Caesar, cum constituisset hiemare in
continenti propter repentinos Galliae motus neque multum aestatis
superesset atque id facile extrahi posse intellegeret, obsides imperat et
quid in annos singulos vectigalis populo Romano Britannia penderet
constituit; interdicit atque imperat Cassivellauno ne Mandubracio neu
Trinovantibus noceat.</i><a id="FNanchor_3367" href="#Footnote_3367" class="fnanchor">3367</a>) Now, observes Dr. Vogel, in the first sentence
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cassivellaunus</i> is grammatically the subject, and in the last the
object; but the reader involuntarily supposes him to be the object
in the intermediate sentence as well. In other words, the reader
takes for granted that Cassivellaunus was ordered to give hostages,
though Caesar does not say so. Moreover, the first sentence, taken
by itself, leads one to suspect Caesar’s good faith. For how came
Caesar’s understrapper, Commius, to be with Cassivellaunus? Is it
not clear that Caesar had sent Commius to Cassivellaunus as his
envoy? In other words, that, whereas Caesar represents Cassivellaunus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_671">671</span>
as having been driven by a series of reverses to offer submission,
Caesar had in reality himself made overtures to Cassivellaunus?<a id="FNanchor_3368" href="#Footnote_3368" class="fnanchor">3368</a></p>

<p>If I were Caesar’s advocate I should merely reply that as Cicero
states, on the testimony of his brother, hostages were given. But,
as Caesar was undoubtedly not incapable of misrepresentation,
Dr. Vogel’s suspicion is possibly not groundless. Caesar may have
sent Commius to Cassivellaunus with an offer of terms; and if so, his
narrative is so far misleading. On the other hand, Cassivellaunus
may first have signified his willingness to submit; and Caesar may
then have employed Commius as his agent.</p>

<p>Dr. Vogel’s general conclusion is that, although Caesar’s narrative
is not expressly contradicted by Cicero’s letters, yet it was, from
first to last, written for effect. Always literally true, it is often
substantially false. His most effective weapon is the apparent
clearness and candour of his style, which puts the reader off his
guard, and prevents him from noticing how very ambiguous many
of the statements are. He conceals essential facts and exaggerates
the importance of trivial successes; and he prevents the unwary
reader from noticing the slowness of his progress in Britain by inserting
in the twelfth and the two following chapters of his Fifth Book
a general description of the country and its inhabitants, from which
point of view this otherwise very inartistic interpolation must be
regarded as a masterpiece of ingenuity.</p>

<p>My general conclusion is that the charges which Dr. Vogel has
brought against Caesar’s narrative for the most part break down,
but that in the one instance which I have noted he may have detected
a flaw.</p>

<p>2. Thomas Lewin, who was a writer of considerable ability,
remarked, in regard to Caesar’s narrative of the events that immediately
preceded his departure from Britain in 55 <small>B.C.</small>, that ‘it is easy
to see, notwithstanding the veil attempted to be thrown over the
transaction, that he wanted only a plausible pretext for transporting
himself and his army back to Gaul’.<a id="FNanchor_3369" href="#Footnote_3369" class="fnanchor">3369</a></p>

<p>Caesar’s account runs as follows:&mdash;‘On the same day the enemy
sent envoys, who came to Caesar to sue for peace. Caesar ordered
them to furnish twice as many hostages as before and take them
across to the Continent; for the equinox was near, and, as his ships
were unsound, he did not think it wise to risk a voyage in stormy
weather. Taking advantage of favourable weather, he set sail,’ &amp;c.
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eodem die legati ab hostibus missi ad Caesarem de pace venerunt. His
Caesar numerum obsidum quem ante imperaverat duplicavit eosque in
continentem adduci iussit, quod propinqua die aequinoctii infirmis
navibus hiemi navigationem subiciendam non existimabat. Ipse
idoneam tempestatem nactus ... naves solvit</i>,<a id="FNanchor_3370" href="#Footnote_3370" class="fnanchor">3370</a> &amp;c.). Where is ‘the veil
attempted to be thrown over the transaction’? Dion’s account,<a id="FNanchor_3371" href="#Footnote_3371" class="fnanchor">3371</a> so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_672">672</span>
far as it goes, confirms that of Caesar. ‘From Dion,’ remarks
Lewin,<a id="FNanchor_3372" href="#Footnote_3372" class="fnanchor">3372</a> ‘we learn that negotiations were opened by the intervention
of some Morini who were friends of the Britons.’ Evidently he had
not read Dion with due attention: the negotiations of which Dion
speaks<a id="FNanchor_3373" href="#Footnote_3373" class="fnanchor">3373</a> were opened immediately after Caesar had, in spite of
British resistance, effected his landing; and Lewin forgets to add
that the Britons induced the Morini to intervene. The truth of
Caesar’s narrative is confirmed by the humorous frankness with
which he avows that the Britons did not all obey his orders. After
describing his return to Gaul, he says, ‘Two British tribes and no
more sent hostages: the rest neglected to do so’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eo duae omnino
civitates ex Britannia obsides miserunt, reliquae neglexerunt</i><a id="FNanchor_3374" href="#Footnote_3374" class="fnanchor">3374</a>).</p>

<p>But I am not concerned to maintain that Caesar’s object was to
tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.<a id="FNanchor_3375" href="#Footnote_3375" class="fnanchor">3375</a> The most
serious omission in his account of his British campaigns has passed
almost unnoticed. In the section of this book which deals with the
chronology of his operations I have demonstrated that either he
passed over in silence a hurried temporary visit to his naval camp
which he made just before the 1st of September (the 5th of August of
the Julian calendar), 54 <small>B.C.</small>, or, if he remained in the camp from
that day until his final departure from Britain, his account of his
negotiations with Cassivellaunus and of the return march of his army
to the coast is misleading.<a id="FNanchor_3376" href="#Footnote_3376" class="fnanchor">3376</a> Moreover, as I have pointed out in
the seventh chapter,<a id="FNanchor_3377" href="#Footnote_3377" class="fnanchor">3377</a> there is reason to suspect that he and his
officers may have known more than he would admit about the
connexion between the tides and the moon’s age. But he told the
truth, so far as he could ascertain it, when he had no solid motive
for falsification; and when he wrote the <cite>Commentaries on the Gallic
War</cite>, he could generally afford to be true.

<p>‘The men ... weighed down with their heavy cumbrous armour,

and also that when they were run aground they would
necessarily have been buried for a considerable depth.<a id="FNanchor_3379" href="#Footnote_3379" class="fnanchor">3379</a> Thus it

<h2 id="PII_Pg673b">THE SITE OF CAESAR’S CAMP IN 55, AND
OF HIS NAVAL CAMP IN 54 B. C.</h2>

<p>I have proved in an earlier article that Caesar landed in 55 <small>B.C.</small>
between Walmer Castle and Deal Castle, and in the following year
between Deal Castle and Sandwich.<a id="FNanchor_3380" href="#Footnote_3380" class="fnanchor">3380</a> Camden,<a id="FNanchor_3381" href="#Footnote_3381" class="fnanchor">3381</a> who assumed that
Caesar landed at the same place on both his expeditions, remarked
that ‘for a considerable length under this shore [in the neighbourhood
of Deal] are a number of heaps like banks which some suppose
to have been blown up by the wind; but’, he added, ‘I rather
take them for the fortifications or defences for ships which Caesar
was ten days and nights throwing up.’ If Camden was referring
to the sand-dunes between Sandown and Sandwich, it is of course
unnecessary to discuss his conjecture. Hasted<a id="FNanchor_3382" href="#Footnote_3382" class="fnanchor">3382</a> thought that the
camp of 55 <small>B.C.</small> might be represented by ‘remains of entrenchments
still visible’, (1) ‘close to the shore between <i>Deal</i> and <i>Walmer Castle</i>’,
or (2) ‘within the country round <i>Walmer Church</i>’, or (3) ‘upon a rise ... between
<i>Deal</i> and <i>Upper Deal</i>’. But these are mere guesses;
and Professor Flinders Petrie, in his ‘Notes on Kentish Earthworks’,<a id="FNanchor_3383" href="#Footnote_3383" class="fnanchor">3383</a>
says nothing which can support either Hasted or Camden, except that
‘there is said to be a fosse around Walmer Church’. I can only add
that nobody will learn anything by going to look for it. Dowker,<a id="FNanchor_3384" href="#Footnote_3384" class="fnanchor">3384</a>
who deluded himself into the belief that Caesar had landed near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_674">674</span>
Sandwich in 55 as well as in 54 <small>B.C.</small>, held that he had encamped in
the first year between Sandwich and Worth, in the second on Richborough
Hill. But Dowker himself maintained that Richborough
Hill was isolated at spring tides; and would Caesar have omitted
to mention that he had sailed into the Rutupian estuary? I am
inclined to believe that he encamped in 54 <small>B.C.</small> on the gently rising
ground near Worth.</p>

<p>Last year (1902) I spent two days in examining the coast between
Kingsdown and Sandown.<a id="FNanchor_3385" href="#Footnote_3385" class="fnanchor">3385</a> The conclusion to which I came was
that in 55 <small>B.C.</small> Caesar must have encamped either on the plateau
between Walmer Castle and Kingsdown, or, much more probably,
on the rising ground north-west of the plateau which is now covered
by part of the town of Walmer. On returning to London, I opened
the second volume of Napoleon’s <cite>Histoire de Jules César</cite>, and found
on pages 160 and 161 that Colonel Stoffel had adopted the latter
alternative.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="PII_Pg674">THE WAR-CHARIOTS OF THE BRITONS</h2>

<p>‘Chariots,’ says Caesar,<a id="FNanchor_3386" href="#Footnote_3386" class="fnanchor">3386</a> ‘are used in action in the following way.
First of all the charioteers drive all over the field, the warriors hurling
missiles; and generally they throw the enemy’s ranks into confusion
by the mere terror inspired by their horses and the clatter of the
wheels. As soon as they have penetrated between the troops of
cavalry the warriors jump off the chariots and fight on foot. The
drivers meanwhile gradually withdraw from the action, and range
the cars in such a position that if the warriors are hard pressed by
the enemy’s numbers, they may easily get back to them. Thus
they exhibit in action the mobility of cavalry combined with the
steadiness of infantry; and they become so expert from constant
habit and practice that they will drive their horses at full gallop,
keeping them well in hand, down a steep incline, check and turn
them in an instant, run along the pole, stand on the yoke, and step
backwards again to the car with the greatest nimbleness’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Genus
hoc est ex essedis pugnae. Primo per omnes partes perequitant et tela

proelio excedunt atque ita currus conlocant ut, si illi a multitudine
hostium premantur, expeditum ad suos receptum habeant. Ita mobilitatem
equitum, stabilitatem peditum in proeliis praestant, ac tantum

consuerint</i>).</p>

<p>M. G. Lafaye<a id="FNanchor_3387" href="#Footnote_3387" class="fnanchor">3387</a> gathers from this description that the object of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_675">675</span>
warrior in running along the pole was to jump down in order to throw
his javelin and to avoid being impeded in his movements by the
proximity of the driver. M. Lafaye assures us that certain coins
represent warriors moving on to the poles of their chariots in order
to hurl their javelins: but they do not represent them as about to
jump down;<a id="FNanchor_3388" href="#Footnote_3388" class="fnanchor">3388</a> and Caesar says that the warrior, after he had run
along the pole, stepped back again on to the car.</p>

<p>Caesar<a id="FNanchor_3389" href="#Footnote_3389" class="fnanchor">3389</a> tells us that, after he had crossed the Thames in 54 <small>B.C.</small>,
Cassivellaunus dismissed the whole of his forces except 4,000 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">essedarii</i>.
Most commentators have inferred, I think rightly, from this statement
that Cassivellaunus had 4,000 chariots; but it seems possible
that by 4,000 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">essedarii</i> Caesar may have meant 2,000 warriors and
2,000 drivers.<a id="FNanchor_3390" href="#Footnote_3390" class="fnanchor">3390</a> Napoleon the Third,<a id="FNanchor_3391" href="#Footnote_3391" class="fnanchor">3391</a> on the other hand, assumes
that there were ‘six <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">essedarii</i> par char’. It is unnecessary to make
any assumptions; for, according to Diodorus Siculus,<a id="FNanchor_3392" href="#Footnote_3392" class="fnanchor">3392</a> who derived
his information from Posidonius, every Gallic chariot carried
a driver and one warrior. Furthermore, a coin of the Hostilian
family, which was struck between 49 and 46 <small>B.C.</small>,<a id="FNanchor_3393" href="#Footnote_3393" class="fnanchor">3393</a> depicts a chariot
drawn by two horses, and driven by a charioteer, who is accompanied
by one warrior, armed with an oblong buckler.</p>

<p>Professor E. B. Tylor,<a id="FNanchor_3394" href="#Footnote_3394" class="fnanchor">3394</a> referring to Pomponius Mela,<a id="FNanchor_3395" href="#Footnote_3395" class="fnanchor">3395</a> Lucan,<a id="FNanchor_3396" href="#Footnote_3396" class="fnanchor">3396</a> and
Silius Italicus,<a id="FNanchor_3397" href="#Footnote_3397" class="fnanchor">3397</a> argues that the Britons used chariots armed with
scythes: Tacitus,<a id="FNanchor_3398" href="#Footnote_3398" class="fnanchor">3398</a> who derived his information from Agricola, says
that the British army which encountered the latter in the Grampians
included <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">covinnarii</i>, who, according to Pomponius Mela, were warriors
who fought in scythed chariots;<a id="FNanchor_3399" href="#Footnote_3399" class="fnanchor">3399</a> and Jornandes<a id="FNanchor_3400" href="#Footnote_3400" class="fnanchor">3400</a> says that the
chariots of the Britons were armed with scythes: but if the Britons
whom Caesar encountered had used such chariots, he would certainly
have mentioned the fact;<a id="FNanchor_3401" href="#Footnote_3401" class="fnanchor">3401</a> and no scythes are to be seen on the

interments of warriors with chariots that have been discovered in
the department of the Marne not one showed any traces of scythes;<a id="FNanchor_3402" href="#Footnote_3402" class="fnanchor">3402</a>
nor have any such traces ever been found in Great Britain.<a id="FNanchor_3403" href="#Footnote_3403" class="fnanchor">3403</a></p>

<p>I have remarked in my narrative of Caesar’s second invasion<a id="FNanchor_3404" href="#Footnote_3404" class="fnanchor">3404</a>
that very few chariot-burials have been found in this country.
It is noteworthy that of the whole number&mdash;not more than a dozen&mdash;all
but two were in Yorkshire, and not one in Scotland; and also
that whereas in many of the Gallic interments the chariot was placed
in the grave entire, only the wheels and other detached parts were
buried in Britain. The most famous of these discoveries was made
nearly a century ago in a barrow on Arras Farm, close to the road
between Beverley and York. Here in a large round grave in the
chalk was found the skeleton of a man, inclining from which, one on
each side, were two wheels, each two feet eleven inches in diameter.<a id="FNanchor_3405" href="#Footnote_3405" class="fnanchor">3405</a>
‘Under and adjoining to each wheel,’ writes Thurnam,<a id="FNanchor_3406" href="#Footnote_3406" class="fnanchor">3406</a> ‘were the
remains of the skeletons of two small horses, neither of them exceeding
thirteen hands.’<a id="FNanchor_3407" href="#Footnote_3407" class="fnanchor">3407</a></p>

<p>In the paragraph in which Caesar describes the tactics of the
charioteers he says that ‘as soon as they have penetrated between
the troops of cavalry, the warriors jump off the chariots and fight
on foot’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum se inter equitum turmas insinuaverunt, ex essedis
desiliunt et pedibus proeliantur</i>). The editors generally assume that
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equitum turmas</i> means ‘the <i>hostile</i> troops of cavalry’; but von
Göler,<a id="FNanchor_3408" href="#Footnote_3408" class="fnanchor">3408</a> with whom Napoleon III<a id="FNanchor_3409" href="#Footnote_3409" class="fnanchor">3409</a> agrees, rejects this view. He
argues that in Caesar’s first campaign in Britain, in his account of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_677">677</span>
which the passage in question occurs, the Britons were not opposed
by any cavalry, for Caesar had none with him; and that the paragraph
is not to be regarded simply as a general description of the
tactics of the charioteers, but also as an explanation of the tactics
which they had pursued in the combat described in the preceding
paragraph. Moreover, he insists that if the warriors had jumped
off their chariots when they had penetrated between troops of
hostile cavalry, and had then allowed the drivers to turn round and
move back, it would have been impossible for them to get on to the
chariots again in case of need: hostile cavalry which allowed them
to do this would have been worthless. ‘According to my interpretation,’
von Göler concludes, ‘we are to understand by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et cum se inter
equitum turmas insinuaverunt</i> that the warriors had penetrated
within the intervals of <i>their own</i> cavalry ... the moment of jumping
down, always hazardous, was protected by their own cavalry, just
as nowadays cavalry protect the limbering up and unlimbering of
the horse-artillery associated with them.’ See also pp. 136-7, and
Taf. vii, fig 7, of von Göler’s book, and pp. 688-91, <i>infra</i>.</p>

<h2 id="PII_Pg677">THE OPERATIONS OF THE BRITONS DURING
THE LAST FEW DAYS OF CAESAR’S
FIRST EXPEDITION</h2>

<p>After describing how he rescued the 7th legion, which had been
sent out on a foraging expedition and surprised by a British force,
Caesar tells us that he led this legion and the force with which he
had marched to its assistance back to camp. ‘Meanwhile,’ he
continues, ‘our people were all busy, and the Britons who were still
in their districts moved off’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dum haec geruntur, nostris omnibus
occupatis, qui erant in agris reliqui discesserunt</i><a id="FNanchor_3410" href="#Footnote_3410" class="fnanchor">3410</a>). The words ‘the
Britons who were still in their districts’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui erant in agris reliqui</i>)
evidently refer back to two passages in the thirtieth and thirty-second
chapters of the Fourth Book of the <cite>Commentaries</cite>. In the former
we read that after the storm which wrecked several of Caesar’s ships
the British chiefs who had disbanded their levies and come into the
Roman camp ‘renewed their oaths of mutual fidelity, and began to
move away one by one from the camp and <i>to fetch their tribesmen
secretly from the districts</i>’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">itaque rursus coniuratione facta, paulatim
ex castris discedere et <em>suos clam ex agris deducere</em> coeperunt</i>). In
the thirty-second chapter Caesar says that, just before the 7th legion
was attacked, ‘some of the natives <i>still remained in the districts</i>’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars hominum <em>in agris remaneret</em></i>). Evidently, then, the meaning
of the passage which I quoted at the beginning of this note is that
during and after the attack on the 7th legion, and while the Roman
soldiers were employed in various duties, those Britons who had not
yet left their respective districts in order to rally round their leaders
did so. However, the meaning which is obvious to the ordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_678">678</span>
mind does not satisfy von Göler,<a id="FNanchor_3411" href="#Footnote_3411" class="fnanchor">3411</a> who insists that the <i>MS.</i> reading,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nostris omnibus occupatis, qui erant in agris reliqui discesserunt</i>, yields
no satisfactory sense, and offers in place of it one of his conjectural
emendations:&mdash;(nostris omnibus occupatis,) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>quae erant in agris
relicta</em></i> (discesserunt). After a few moments of bewilderment the
reader suddenly apprehends von Göler’s meaning. He fancied that
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">occupatis</i> meant ‘having been taken possession of’, and was ignorant
that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nostris omnibus</i> in Caesarian Latin could not mean ‘all our
belongings’; so he persuaded himself that Caesar intended to
convey that the Britons, ‘having appropriated all our property,
which had been left in the fields, made off’! ‘The Romans,’ he
explains, ‘had not only not been able to convey into camp the corn
which they had cut, but, on account of the surprise, they must even
have abandoned their tools for cutting and gathering the corn.’</p>

<p>Comment is needless.</p>

<h2 id="PII_Pg678">WHERE DID CAESAR ENCOUNTER THE
BRITONS ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS
SECOND LANDING IN BRITAIN?</h2>

<p>‘Caesar disembarked the army, and chose a suitable spot for
a camp. Having ascertained from prisoners where the enemy’s
forces were posted, he marched against them about the third watch.... After
a night march of about twelve miles he descried the enemy’s
force. Advancing with their cavalry and chariots from higher
ground towards a river,<a id="FNanchor_3412" href="#Footnote_3412" class="fnanchor">3412</a> they attempted to check our men, and forced
on an action. Beaten off by the cavalry, they fell back into the
woods and occupied a well-fortified post of great natural strength,
which they had apparently prepared for defence some time before
with a view to war with their neighbours; for all the entrances were
blocked by felled trees laid close together’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caesar exposito exercitu
et loco castris idoneo capto, ubi ex captivis cognovit quo in loco hostium
copiae consedissent ... de tertia vigilia ad hostes contendit ... ipse noctu

Illi equitatu atque essedis ad flumen progressi ex loco superiore nostros

silvas abdiderunt locum nacti egregie et natura et opere munitum, quem
domestici belli, ut videbatur, causa iam ante praeparaverant: nam
crebris arboribus succisis omnes introitus erant praeclusi</i><a id="FNanchor_3413" href="#Footnote_3413" class="fnanchor">3413</a>).</p>

<p>Such is the description which Caesar gives of his first encounter
with the Britons in 54 <small>B.C.</small> The question of the site is closely connected
with the question of the place where he landed. I have
proved that this place was between Walmer and Sandwich.<a id="FNanchor_3414" href="#Footnote_3414" class="fnanchor">3414</a> It is
clear, therefore, that Caesar could not have encountered the Britons
either at Robertsbridge on the Rother, where Airy believed that
he had discovered the battle-field,<a id="FNanchor_3415" href="#Footnote_3415" class="fnanchor">3415</a> or at Wye on the Great Stour,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_679">679</span>
the site adopted by Lewin.<a id="FNanchor_3416" href="#Footnote_3416" class="fnanchor">3416</a> It is certain, however, that the battle
was fought either on the Great Stour or on the Little Stour.</p>

<p>1. Napoleon the Third<a id="FNanchor_3417" href="#Footnote_3417" class="fnanchor">3417</a> asserts that the river mentioned by
Caesar was ‘unquestionably the Little Stour’; and he maintains
that the left bank in the neighbourhood of Barham and Kingston
corresponds with the description of the combat. The rising ground
on this bank is not, he remarks, too uneven to have prevented war-chariots
and cavalry from acting, and, as the text of the <cite>Commentaries</cite>
requires, the Britons would have occupied a commanding
position (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus superior</i>) on the gentle slopes which terminate at
the water’s edge. We may safely conclude, he adds, from Caesar’s
narrative that the combat was unimportant, and that his cavalry
crossed the river without difficulty.</p>

<p>Lewin<a id="FNanchor_3418" href="#Footnote_3418" class="fnanchor">3418</a> dismisses this view with the remark that the Little Stour
is ‘too insignificant to have been designated by Caesar as a river’;
but the Emperor, who had anticipated this objection, replied that
Caesar used the same word (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flumen</i>) to denote the Oze and the
Ozerain,&mdash;the two rivulets which encompass Mont Auxois in the
Côte-d’Or, where Vercingetorix made his final stand.<a id="FNanchor_3419" href="#Footnote_3419" class="fnanchor">3419</a> No one,
however, who has seen the Little Stour at Kingston, the Oze, and
the Ozerain, will admit that the Kentish ‘nailbourne’ deserves to
be treated as respectfully as the two Burgundian streams.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May, 1902, I walked along the Little Stour from
Barham to Bekesbourne. There was not so much as a teaspoonful
of water in the channel; and a policeman whom I met near Kingston
told me that it had been dry for the last five years. On the other
hand, an old labourer, who had lived in the valley for sixty-four
years, remarked that he could remember a time when the rivulet
often overflowed its banks: on the 18th of April of this year (1904)
I myself saw it running past Barham with a strong stream; and
a porter at Barham station said, ‘Yes, and it isn’t half as strong as
it was a month ago.’ Moreover, Bryan Faussett,<a id="FNanchor_3420" href="#Footnote_3420" class="fnanchor">3420</a> writing between
1767 and 1773, said that the Little Stour about a mile below Kingston
was ‘seldom or never dry’; and Philippott,<a id="FNanchor_3421" href="#Footnote_3421" class="fnanchor">3421</a> speaking of Bekesbourne,
affirms that in the reign of Edward the Third ‘there
was a small navigation out of the river of Stoure up to this
place’.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_680">680</span></p>

<p>There need be no difficulty, then, in believing that the Little
Stour, in Caesar’s day, was a running stream, which he might perhaps
have called a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flumen</i>, though it must not be forgotten that both in
55 <small>B.C.</small> and in the following year, the summer, at all events in Gaul,
was exceptionally dry.<a id="FNanchor_3422" href="#Footnote_3422" class="fnanchor">3422</a> Nevertheless, it is certain that the Britons
did not encounter Caesar on the Little Stour. Consider the meaning
of his words:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">illi equitatu atque essedis ad flumen progressi ex loco
superiore nostros prohibere et proelium committere coeperunt</i>.<a id="FNanchor_3423" href="#Footnote_3423" class="fnanchor">3423</a> At one
time I thought that this passage meant, ‘Advancing towards a river
with their cavalry and chariots, they attempted from their commanding
position (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex loco superiore</i>) to check our men,’ &amp;c.: but a passage
in the twenty-third chapter of the Second Book of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gallic War</i>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alia
in parte diversae duae legiones, XI et VIII, profligatis Viromanduis,
quibuscum erant congressae, ex loco superiore in ipsis fluminis ripis
proeliabantur</i>&mdash;in which the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex loco superiore</i> unquestionably
belong to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">profligatis</i>, leads me to believe that the former of the
alternative translations which I have given&mdash;‘Advancing with their
cavalry and chariots from higher ground towards a river, they
attempted to check our men,’ &amp;c.&mdash;is to be preferred. At all events
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus superior</i> was not without tactical significance, and was
either the left bank of the stream or high ground in close proximity
to the left bank. Now between Barham and the northern end of
Charlton Park, which is below Kingston, the depth of the channel
of the Little Stour does not exceed 18 inches; and even at Bekesbourne
it is only about two feet. Therefore, unless the depth of
the channel was considerably greater in 54 <small>B.C.</small> than it is now, and
unless the water flowed considerably below the level of the banks,
the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus superior</i> could not have been applied to the bank
itself anywhere between Barham and Bekesbourne.<a id="FNanchor_3424" href="#Footnote_3424" class="fnanchor">3424</a> Moreover,
although there are well-defined heights on the left bank between
Barham and Bridge, the lowest slopes, except opposite Kingston
and for a very short space on either side of it, are at a considerable
distance from the channel. Assuming that Caesar crossed the Little
Stour at or near Kingston, the Britons could have opposed him
more effectually when he was ascending Barham Downs than by
attempting to defend the passage of the rivulet. And, since he would
in any case be obliged to cross the Stour itself, is it not obvious that
they would have waited for him behind the river which might fairly
be called an obstacle rather than on the banks of the streamlet which
an active lad could have jumped over?</p>

<p>2. If Napoleon’s view is inadmissible, it is difficult to characterize
that adopted by the Reverend Francis Vine.<a id="FNanchor_3425" href="#Footnote_3425" class="fnanchor">3425</a> He assures us that
Caesar ‘descried the British forces ... lining the crest of the hill
(described in the ‘Commentaries’ as “superior locus”) from
Garrington (near Littlebourne) on his right hand, to probably the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_681">681</span>
part of Barham Downs opposite Bridge and Bishopsbourne on his
left. This was the best position which the Britons could possibly
have chosen for the purpose of arresting the progress of an army
marching upon Caer Caint (Canterbury)’. In other words, Mr. Vine
holds that the Britons awaited Caesar’s approach not on the further
but on the nearer side of the river! ‘That the Britons were traditionally
reported to have opposed Caesar’s progress <i>before he
reached</i> the river, rather than after passing it, may,’ he says, ‘be
inferred from the following passage from Pomponius Sabinus, out
of Seneca: “And in the night marching twelve miles up into the
country, Caesar finds out the Britons, who <i>retreated as far as the river</i>,
but gave him battle there.”’ So we are to prefer the authority
of Seneca to that of the general who fought the battle! Besides,
Mr. Vine fails to see that the passage which he quotes (and which is
not to be found in Seneca) need only mean that the Britons, when
Caesar descried them, had retreated from the seashore to the banks
of the river. Why Pomponius Sabinus, an Italian scholar who was
born 1,470 years after Caesar died, should be summoned as a witness
it is not easy to understand. The only inference which can be
deduced from Caesar’s narrative&mdash;the only inference which has ever
been deduced from it by any scholar&mdash;is that the Britons, when
Caesar descried them, were on the further side of the river, and that
they advanced to its left bank in order to dispute his passage.</p>

<p>Mr. Vine’s view<a id="FNanchor_3426" href="#Footnote_3426" class="fnanchor">3426</a> of the route which Caesar followed appears to
be partly based upon ‘traces of encampments which still remain’.
But who made them? Certainly not these Britons, who, only a few
hours before Caesar began his night march, had retreated from the
coast into the interior in order to oppose his progress, and whose
stronghold was not on the right but on the left bank of the river.
Certainly not Caesar, who, in marching from the coast to encounter
the Britons, made no camp at all. The tumuli which have been
opened on Kingston Down were, as Roach Smith says, ‘neither more
nor less than those of Saxons.’<a id="FNanchor_3427" href="#Footnote_3427" class="fnanchor">3427</a> Mr. Vine<a id="FNanchor_3428" href="#Footnote_3428" class="fnanchor">3428</a> asserts that ‘there were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_682">682</span>
probably two large oblong castra [constructed by Caesar], the one
extending along Barham Downs opposite Charlton, the other at the
western extremity of the Downs extending over part of Bridge Hill,
Bourne Park, and perhaps the grounds of Higham’. But without
excavation it would be impossible to prove that any ‘castra’ had
been erected on Barham Downs by Caesar; and without going to
this trouble any man who can understand the <cite>Commentaries</cite> may
conclude that he certainly did not construct two.</p>

<p>3. Lyon, the author of the <cite>History of the Town and Port of Dover</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_3429" href="#Footnote_3429" class="fnanchor">3429</a>
maintains that the combat took place near Littlebourne, about two
miles lower down than Bekesbourne; but this place is on the road
from Sandwich to Canterbury, and barely nine miles from the
former. If Caesar marched along the line of this road, he must
have encountered the Britons on the Great Stour near Canterbury.
Assuming that he marched from the neighbourhood of Deal, Lyon’s
view might perhaps be defended if there were any reason to believe
that on the left bank of the Little Stour near Littlebourne there
was a stronghold;<a id="FNanchor_3430" href="#Footnote_3430" class="fnanchor">3430</a> but in a former article<a id="FNanchor_3431" href="#Footnote_3431" class="fnanchor">3431</a> I have given cogent
reasons for believing that in 54 <small>B.C.</small> Caesar encamped some miles
north of Deal.</p>

<p>It may, then, be regarded as morally certain that the river on
which the Britons encountered Caesar was the Great Stour. It has,
indeed, been objected that the least distance of the Great Stour
from Deal is not twelve, but fifteen miles; but while this argument
may be valid against the theory that Caesar landed in 54 <small>B.C.</small> at
Deal, the position that he defeated the Britons on the Great Stour
remains unshaken.</p>

<p>4. The Reverend R. C. Jenkins<a id="FNanchor_3432" href="#Footnote_3432" class="fnanchor">3432</a> holds that the scene of the encounter
was Chilham, about six miles above Canterbury, on the
Ashford road. ‘The only obstacle,’ he pleads, ‘is the increased
distance, which is sixteen, instead of twelve miles ... a difference
which the loss of a single stroke might account for [the scribe being
supposed to have written <small>XII</small> instead of <small>XVI</small>], if, indeed, it is not
sufficiently explained by the possible miscalculation of the time of
the march ... everything else falls into perfect harmony with the
narrative&mdash;the high wooded ground at the back, the steep banks, the
wide and rapid stream,’ &amp;c. And again, ‘Let us remember that
the journey was during the night, when the ground would be rapidly
passed over, and the actual distance would be less apparent ... the
space traversed is only described as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">milia passuum <i>circiter</i> duodecim</span>”,
and even then the position of the enemy was merely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_683">683</span>
discerned afar off ... here we have ancient mounds and earthworks,
which give silent testimony to the fact that Chilham was a military
position of the highest importance even during the British period.’<a id="FNanchor_3433" href="#Footnote_3433" class="fnanchor">3433</a></p>

<p>These arguments have no weight. When numbers attested by
the consensus of the <i>MSS.</i> are not manifestly wrong, we have no
right to distort them into agreement with our own preferences.
The distance, in a straight line, from the nearest point on which
Caesar could have encamped, if he had landed near Sandwich,<a id="FNanchor_3434" href="#Footnote_3434" class="fnanchor">3434</a> to
Chilham, is about 20 Roman miles; from the place where he would
have encamped if he had landed near Deal,<a id="FNanchor_3435" href="#Footnote_3435" class="fnanchor">3435</a> approximately 16;
and the actual distance which he would have had to march is of
course considerably longer. Why he should have marched more
rapidly by night than by day it would be difficult to explain;<a id="FNanchor_3436" href="#Footnote_3436" class="fnanchor">3436</a> and
the remark that ‘the position of the enemy was merely discerned
afar off’ is a pure invention. If ‘we have ancient mounds and
earthworks’ at Chilham, they prove nothing about Caesar;<a id="FNanchor_3437" href="#Footnote_3437" class="fnanchor">3437</a> and
we have them also at other places near the course of the river.
Besides, why should Caesar have made a forced march in order to
cross the Stour at Chilham when, by making an ordinary march of
12 miles, he could have crossed it near Canterbury?<a id="FNanchor_3438" href="#Footnote_3438" class="fnanchor">3438</a></p>

<p>Our search for the site is now confined within narrow limits.
Below Fordwich, the Stour, in Caesar’s time, would certainly have
been impassable in the face of an enemy; for it flowed through
a broad morass.<a id="FNanchor_3439" href="#Footnote_3439" class="fnanchor">3439</a> Between Canterbury and the bridge above Sturry
the river is virtually flush with its banks. It appears to me, then,
that Caesar must have crossed it either between Fordwich and Sturry,
or in the neighbourhood of Thanington, just above Canterbury, or
possibly at Canterbury itself. Above Canterbury it flows through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_684">684</span>
nearly level meadows: its width is about 15 or 16 yards: the banks
are about 2 feet high; and the depth of the water at present is
apparently about 2 feet. The bottom at the bridge above Thanington
is sandy and gravelly. Opposite this point and at a distance of,
say, 600 yards, the ground begins to rise into wooded heights.
Opposite Thanington, and east of it, the heights are considerably
nearer the river; but they gradually sink as they approach
Canterbury.</p>

<p>At Sturry the lower slopes of the low hills which extend along the
northern side of the valley approach very close to the river, say to
within 100 yards; but opposite Fordwich they are much further
away. Just below the mill at Sturry the Stour is from 15 to 20 yards
wide: the banks are 3 or 4 feet above the water: the average depth
is apparently from about 18 inches to 2 feet; and the bottom is
sand mixed with stones. At Fordwich the depth of the water, as
seen from the bridge, is about 5 feet: the banks are 4 or 5 feet above
the water; and the bottom from this point downwards is mud.</p>

<p>5. The eminent geographer, Major Rennell,<a id="FNanchor_3440" href="#Footnote_3440" class="fnanchor">3440</a> believed that Caesar
crossed at the place where ‘the western road intersects the course
of the Stour’; but he gave no reasons for preferring this site to
Fordwich, Sturry, or Thanington.</p>

<p>6. Von Göler<a id="FNanchor_3441" href="#Footnote_3441" class="fnanchor">3441</a> and Guest<a id="FNanchor_3442" href="#Footnote_3442" class="fnanchor">3442</a> maintain that the battle was fought at
or near Sturry; and Heller<a id="FNanchor_3443" href="#Footnote_3443" class="fnanchor">3443</a> appears to agree with them. So does
Roach Smith,<a id="FNanchor_3444" href="#Footnote_3444" class="fnanchor">3444</a> who, at Guest’s request, made ‘a survey of the
vicinity of Grove Ferry’, which survey, I presume, extended as far
up the river as Sturry. ‘There,’ he says, ‘I found the river with
the high bank ... the woods and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oppidum</i>,’<a id="FNanchor_3445" href="#Footnote_3445" class="fnanchor">3445</a> &amp;c. Napoleon<a id="FNanchor_3446" href="#Footnote_3446" class="fnanchor">3446</a> argues
that the banks at Sturry are so steep that the Roman cavalry could
not have forced a passage without great difficulty, whereas it would
appear from Caesar’s account that they crossed easily; and also
that Sturry is 15, not 12 miles from Deal. The latter objection
may be disposed of at once. Napoleon himself maintains that
Caesar’s anchorage in 54 <small>B.C.</small> was ‘some kilometres’ north of the
spot where he had landed in the preceding year;<a id="FNanchor_3447" href="#Footnote_3447" class="fnanchor">3447</a> and this spot
he rightly fixes between Walmer and Deal. Therefore the place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_685">685</span>
from which Caesar descried the Britons just before they advanced
to the bank of the stream was not 12 miles from Deal, but, as I have
shown in a previous article,<a id="FNanchor_3448" href="#Footnote_3448" class="fnanchor">3448</a> from a point in the neighbourhood of
Sandwich. Certainly it would have been more difficult to force the
passage of the Stour at Sturry than of the Little Stour near Kingston;
but, as we have seen, the latter would practically have presented
no obstacle at all. Airy,<a id="FNanchor_3449" href="#Footnote_3449" class="fnanchor">3449</a> who holds that if the Britons had been
posted on the Stour at all, ‘Caesar would have crossed at the sound
ground of Canterbury or above it,’ observes that ‘the place had
been selected by the Britons as a defensive post at least two days
previously, and may therefore be presumed to have had the qualifications
necessary for a defensive post, namely that it could not be
turned, and that enemies could attack it in front only at a disadvantage’;
and, remarking that ‘there can scarcely be a doubt that
Canterbury existed then as an important town’, he adds that ‘of
this there is no mention in Caesar’. But why should Caesar have
mentioned Canterbury? It was not a strategical point: there was
nothing to be gained by attacking it except perhaps a little plunder;
and anything worth plundering would certainly have been removed
into the stronghold which he did attack. ‘The place [on the banks
of the river] had been selected [or, at all events, occupied] as a defensive
post’ not two days but one day previously; and, generally
speaking, to select a defensive post on a river which cannot be turned
is impossible.<a id="FNanchor_3450" href="#Footnote_3450" class="fnanchor">3450</a> The stronghold to which the Britons retreated was
probably, as Mr. George Payne holds,<a id="FNanchor_3451" href="#Footnote_3451" class="fnanchor">3451</a> and as I have shown in my
narrative,<a id="FNanchor_3452" href="#Footnote_3452" class="fnanchor">3452</a> the British <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oppidum</i> in Bigberry (or Bigbury) woods,
about a mile and a half west of Canterbury, of which traces still
exist; and it seems most likely that the passage of the river took
place at some point between Canterbury and Thanington.</p>

<h2 id="PII_Pg685">CAESAR’S EARLIER OPERATIONS IN 54 B. C.
(<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, V, 9-11)</h2>

<p>Caesar’s account of the events which occurred on the day after
his first encounter with the Britons in 54 <small>B.C.</small> has been interpreted
in several different ways; and yet his narrative is so clear that
one would have thought it impossible to misunderstand it. After
describing the first encounter, he proceeds, ‘Caesar, however, forbade
them [the legionaries] to pursue the fugitives far, partly because
he had no knowledge of the ground, partly because the day was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_686">686</span>
far spent and he wished to have time for entrenching his camp.
On the following morning he sent a light division of infantry and
cavalry, in three columns, to pursue the fugitives. They had
advanced a considerable distance, the rear-guard being still in sight,
when some troopers from Quintus Atrius came to Caesar with the
news that there had been a great storm on the preceding night, and
that almost all the ships had been damaged and gone ashore.... On
receiving this information, Caesar recalled the legions and cavalry,
ordering them to defend themselves as they marched, and went
back himself to the ships.... Although it involved great trouble
and labour, he decided that the best plan would be to have all the
ships hauled up and connected with the camp by one entrenchment.
About ten days were spent in these operations, the troops not
suspending work even in the night.’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sed eos fugientes longius Caesar
prosequi vetuit, et quod loci naturam ignorabat, et quod magna parte
diei consumpta munitioni castrorum tempus relinqui volebat. Postridie
eius diei mane tripertito milites equitesque in expeditionem misit, ut eos
qui fugerant persequerentur. His aliquantum itineris progressis, cum
iam extremi essent in prospectu, equites a Q. Atrio ad Caesarem venerunt,
qui nuntiarent superiore nocte maxima coorta tempestate prope
omnes naves adflictas atque in litus eiectas esse.... His rebus cognitis
Caesar legiones equitatumque revocari atque in itinere resistere iubet,
ipse ad naves revertitur ... Ipse, etsi res erat multae operae ac laboris,
tamen commodissimum esse statuit omnes naves subduci et cum castris
una munitione coniungi. In his rebus circiter dies X consumit ne
nocturnis quidem temporibus ad laborem militum intermissis.</i><a id="FNanchor_3453" href="#Footnote_3453" class="fnanchor">3453</a>)</p>

<p>The camp for the construction of which Caesar wished to allow
time was of course quite distinct from the one for which, on the
previous day, he had selected a site near his landing-place,<a id="FNanchor_3454" href="#Footnote_3454" class="fnanchor">3454</a> and was
to be in the neighbourhood of the place where he had beaten the
enemy, that is to say, twelve Roman miles or more from the sea.<a id="FNanchor_3455" href="#Footnote_3455" class="fnanchor">3455</a>
Next morning he dispatched three flying columns in pursuit of the
fugitives; and his rear-guard was just visible when the messengers
arrived with the news of the shipwreck. He sent a galloper to recall
the pursuing columns; and, as their retreat would naturally
encourage the fugitives to rally and return to the attack, they were
to offer the best resistance they could as they marched back to the
coast.</p>

<p>C. Schneider<a id="FNanchor_3456" href="#Footnote_3456" class="fnanchor">3456</a> misunderstands the passage as far as misunderstanding
is possible. He holds that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum iam extremi essent in prospectu</i>
means ‘when the rear <i>of the enemy</i> was just in sight’. But
Caesar was not with any of the three pursuing columns, for he tells
us that he sent them in pursuit: therefore, if Schneider were right,
we should be forced to believe that he learned afterwards that the
enemy’s rear had been just in sight. But why resort to this fanciful
explanation, seeing that Caesar could by no possibility have ascertained
that the rear of the fugitives was just visible to his troops
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_687">687</span>
at the very moment when he himself, separated from the troops,
received the news of the shipwreck; and, further, that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extremi</i> must
grammatically refer to <i>his</i>, that is to say, the pursuing columns?
It has been objected that if <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extremi</i> meant the Roman rear-guard,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">iam</i> would not have its proper meaning, ‘already’ (ἤδη). But <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">iam</i>
of course often means ‘by this time’, or ‘at length’ (nearly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tandem</i>).
In the passage in question its sense may, I think, be illustrated by
a clause in <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, vii, 83, § 7,&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum iam meridies adpropinquare
videretur</i> (‘at length when it was evidently near noon’). Caesar
meant to say that his pursuing columns had advanced so far that
by the time when the news of the shipwreck reached him the rear-guard
only was in sight. Again, Schneider takes the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
itinere resistere iubet</i> to mean that Caesar ordered his troops ‘to stop
in their march and halt where they were’. But, as Long<a id="FNanchor_3457" href="#Footnote_3457" class="fnanchor">3457</a> points
out, ‘if this is so, he returned to his ships himself (“ipse”), leaving
his men in the country doing nothing for ten days. But he tells
us that his soldiers were employed in making his “munitio”, and
therefore they must have come back to the camp.’</p>

<p>So far Long is quite right; but he too makes a great mistake.
He actually believes<a id="FNanchor_3458" href="#Footnote_3458" class="fnanchor">3458</a> that the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">munitioni castrorum tempus
relinqui volebat</i> (‘he wished to leave time for entrenching his camp’)
refer to the camp near the seashore, for which he had selected a site
immediately after the disembarkation. In other words, he believes
that Caesar compelled his troops, who had already made a night-march
of twelve miles, beaten the enemy on the banks of the Stour,
stormed the stronghold to which the beaten enemy had retreated,
and then pursued the fugitives for some distance, to march back
all the way to the camp by the seashore, entrench it, and next morning
march back again twelve miles or more into the interior, and then
start in pursuit of the fugitives! The legionaries were hardy fellows;
but if they did all this, they must have been as breathless as the
reader will be when he has got to the end of the preceding sentence.
And what had the fugitives been about? If Long is right, they
must have got such a start that to pursue them would have been
a wild-goose chase indeed. Needless to say, what Caesar meant was
simply this:&mdash;when the Britons had been dislodged from their
stronghold, he would not allow his troops to pursue them far because
he wished to leave time for the construction of the temporary camp
in which he intended to pass the night.</p>

<p>Von Göler<a id="FNanchor_3459" href="#Footnote_3459" class="fnanchor">3459</a> needlessly quarrels with the text of the <cite>Commentaries</cite>,
and makes matters worse by an absurd emendation. ‘The reading
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legiones equitatumque revocari atque in itinere resistere iubet</i> (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>,
v, 11, § 1),’ he says, ‘is obviously corrupt. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atque</i> requires that the
following clause should involve a climax’ (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Steigerung</i>). But so it
does:&mdash;Caesar ‘orders the legions and cavalry to be recalled, and
[not only to come back but also] to defend themselves upon the
march’. In this literal translation a climax is as evident as in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_688">688</span>
emendation, to be quoted presently, which von Göler offers; and any
one who is not familiar with the <cite>Commentaries</cite> will find in Meusel’s
<cite>Lexicon Caesarianum</cite> abundant evidence that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atque</i> in the passage
which von Göler brands as corrupt is in accord with Caesar’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usus
loquendi</i>.</p>

<p>‘As finally,’ continues von Göler, ‘one may conclude with certainty
from the later substance of the narrative that all the legions
returned to the shore, but the necessary express mention of the march
thither is nowhere to be found in the <cite>Commentaries</cite>, I believe that
the passage originally ran as follows:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legiones equitatumque revocari
atque in itinere persistere iubet ad naves, ipse revertitur</i>.’
If we may ‘conclude with certainty’ that ‘the legions returned’,
why should the ‘express mention’ of their return be necessary?
Heller<a id="FNanchor_3460" href="#Footnote_3460" class="fnanchor">3460</a> has taken the trouble to show that the text is above suspicion.</p>

<h2 id="PII_Pg688">CAESAR’S SECOND COMBAT WITH THE
BRITONS IN 54 B. C.</h2>

<p>There is a passage in Caesar’s account of his second combat with
the Britons in 54 <small>B.C.</small> which has greatly exercised the minds of the
commentators; and editors have put upon it an interpretation
which soldiers will not accept. The passage runs as follows:&mdash;‘Throughout
this peculiar combat, which was fought in full view
of every one and actually in front of the camp, it was clear that our
infantry, owing to the weight of their armour, were ill fitted to
engage an enemy of this kind; for they could not pursue him when
he retreated, and they dared not abandon their regular formation:
it was clear too that the cavalry fought at great risk, because the
enemy generally fell back on purpose, and, after drawing our men
a little distance away from the legions, leaped down from their
chariots and fought on foot with the odds in their favour. [On the
other hand, the mode in which their cavalry fought exposed the
Romans, alike in retreat and in pursuit, to an exactly similar danger.<a id="FNanchor_3461" href="#Footnote_3461" class="fnanchor">3461</a>]’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Toto hoc in qenere pugnae cum sub oculis omnium ac pro castris dimicaretur,
intellectum est nostros propter gravitatem armorum, quod neque
insequi cedentes possent neque ab signis discedere auderent, minus
aptos esse ad huius generis hostem, equites autem magno cum periculo
proelio dimicare, propterea quod illi etiam consulto plerumque cederent
et, cum paulum ab legionibus nostros removissent, ex essedis desilirent
et pedibus dispari proelio contenderent.</i> [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Equestris autem proelii ratio
et cedentibus et insequentibus par atque idem periculum inferebat</i><a id="FNanchor_3462" href="#Footnote_3462" class="fnanchor">3462</a>]). It
is the last sentence which has caused all the trouble.</p>

<p>1. ‘After describing the difficulties of the infantry,’ says Long,<a id="FNanchor_3463" href="#Footnote_3463" class="fnanchor">3463</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_689">689</span>
‘Caesar explains the danger to which the cavalry was exposed, when
they pursued the “essedarii”, for the Britanni quitted their “esseda”
and fought on foot among the Roman “equites”.... This was an
unequal kind of fighting (“dispar proelium”) for the Roman
“equites”. Caesar adds, that on the other hand (“autem”) the
British mode of fighting from the “esseda” (“equestris proelii
ratio”) was equally dangerous to his cavalry and legions in the
pursuit and the retreat. This is Schneider’s explanation, and
I believe that it is right. The Britanni had no cavalry: they had
only “essedarii”, to whom Caesar (iv, 33) applies the term “perequitant”.
It follows that “equites hostium essedariique” (c. 15)
are no more than the “essedarii” (iv, 24) [in other words that
Caesar, who was not a prolix writer, used four words when one would
have sufficed.] In iv, 34, however, Caesar says, “peditatus equitatusque.”’
Yes, he does; and the reader will please note the
significance of this admission.</p>

<p>The assumption upon which Long’s explanation rests, namely, that
‘the Britanni had no cavalry’, is unsupported by any evidence, and
is wholly inadmissible. Caesar says that in his first campaign in
Britain a party of Roman foragers were surrounded by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equitatu atque
essedis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_3464" href="#Footnote_3464" class="fnanchor">3464</a> If these words do not mean ‘cavalry <i>and</i> chariots’, what
do they mean? Warriors on horseback are depicted on ancient
British coins;<a id="FNanchor_3465" href="#Footnote_3465" class="fnanchor">3465</a> and the Britons certainly had cavalry as well as
chariots in <small>A.D.</small> 61<a id="FNanchor_3466" href="#Footnote_3466" class="fnanchor">3466</a> and in the time of Agricola.<a id="FNanchor_3467" href="#Footnote_3467" class="fnanchor">3467</a> Besides, as von
Göler points out,<a id="FNanchor_3468" href="#Footnote_3468" class="fnanchor">3468</a> the charioteers could not have fought with effect
unless they had been supported by cavalry. And when Long says
that, according to Caesar, ‘the British mode of fighting from the
“esseda” ... was equally dangerous to his cavalry and legions in
the pursuit and the retreat,’ his explanation refutes itself. Caesar
himself says that the legions could not pursue the charioteers; and,
on the other hand, it is evident that they were not pursued by the
charioteers.</p>

<p>2. According to von Göler,<a id="FNanchor_3469" href="#Footnote_3469" class="fnanchor">3469</a> ‘by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cedentibus et insequentibus</i> the
chariot-fighters only can be meant’ (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unter den</i> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘cedentibus et
insequentibus’</span> <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">können nur die Wagenstreiter verstanden werden</i>);
and, placing a comma after <i>par</i>, he translates the passage thus:&mdash;‘The
mode of fighting of the [British] cavalry corresponded with
that of their charioteers, whether they retreated or pursued, and
brought the Roman cavalry into precisely the same danger’ <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">(<i>Der
Gefechtsmechanismus der</i> [<i>britischen</i>] <i>Reiterei war aber der Fechtweise
ihrer Wagenstreiter, ob sie wichen oder verfolgten, entsprechend</i> [par]
<i>und brachte die römische Reiterei gerade in jenes nachtheilige Verhältniss</i></span><a id="FNanchor_3470" href="#Footnote_3470" class="fnanchor">3470</a>).
But no Latin scholar would admit that a comma could be
placed after <i>par</i>, which would of course make it necessary to supply
the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">erat</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_690">690</span></p>

<p>3. According to Dittenberger-Kraner,<a id="FNanchor_3471" href="#Footnote_3471" class="fnanchor">3471</a> the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equestris autem
proelii ratio</i>, if they are genuine, can only mean, in opposition to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex
essedis ... contenderent</i>, the mode of fighting of the charioteers, which,
while it was dangerous to the Romans when they pursued, was no
less dangerous to them when they retreated. I confess that I cannot
understand this comment.</p>

<p>4. Doberenz-Dinter<a id="FNanchor_3472" href="#Footnote_3472" class="fnanchor">3472</a> also insist upon the opposition between
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equestris autem proelii ratio</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex essedis ... contenderent</i>, and
maintain that the former refers to ‘a regular cavalry combat (on
the part of the Romans)’,&mdash;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ein regelrechtes Reitertreffen (von Seiten
der Römer)</i>. Now in the passage which ends with the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex
essedis ... contenderent</i> Caesar describes a combat between the
Roman cavalry and the British charioteers, who were supported by
cavalry. Therefore the editors (if I have succeeded in grasping their
meaning) suppose that the ‘regular cavalry combat’ to which they
allude was fought between the Roman cavalry and the British
cavalry alone. This must, I think, be what they intend to convey;
for, according to Mr. Peskett,<a id="FNanchor_3473" href="#Footnote_3473" class="fnanchor">3473</a> who may have followed them, ‘Caesar
means that when the British and Roman cavalry were engaged, the
danger was equalized [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equestris autem proelii ratio et cedentibus et insequentibus
par atque idem periculum inferebat</i>], whereas when
they used chariots the Britons were at an advantage.’ But if Caesar
simply meant that the British cavalry and the Roman in the (hypothetical)
‘regular cavalry combat’ were each exposed to the same
danger, what is the point of the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et cedentibus et insequentibus</i>?
Surely retreating cavalry are in greater danger than the
cavalry which has forced them to retreat and is pursuing them!
I do not see how Mr. Peskett’s explanation can be got out of the
Latin. And who will believe that the Britons would have used their
cavalry alone when, by associating them with chariots, they ‘were
at an advantage’?</p>

<p>5. It might possibly be suggested that the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equestris ... inferebat</i>
refer to a cavalry combat between the Romans and the
Britons, distinct from the combat between Roman cavalry and the
British charioteers, in which the British cavalry, like that of the
Germans,<a id="FNanchor_3474" href="#Footnote_3474" class="fnanchor">3474</a> were associated with light infantry. But there is no
evidence that the Britons had cavalry of this kind; and, as we
have seen, it is certain that their cavalry acted in support of their
charioteers.</p>

<p>6. Köchly and Rüstow<a id="FNanchor_3475" href="#Footnote_3475" class="fnanchor">3475</a> offer the following explanation:&mdash;‘As
the enemy were also supported by their cavalry, our men [the
Romans] were exposed to the same danger, whether they advanced
or retreated’ (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Da aber der Feind auch die Unterstützung seiner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_691">691</span>
Reiterei hatte, so war für die unsrige die Gefahr immer dieselbe, mochte
sie vorgehen oder zurückgehen</i>).</p>

<p>7. Napoleon the Third<a id="FNanchor_3476" href="#Footnote_3476" class="fnanchor">3476</a> explains the matter thus:&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Un désavantage
plus grand encore existait pour les cavaliers. Les Bretons,
par une fuite simulée, les attiraient loin des légions, et alors, sautant
à bas de leurs chars, engageaient à pied une lutte inégale; car,
toujours soutenus par leur cavalerie, ils étaient aussi dangereux dans
l’attaque que dans la défense.’</span> These words, which appear to be
virtually identical in sense with those of Köchly and Rüstow, undoubtedly
give an accurate account of what took place. Apparently
Köchly, Rüstow, and Napoleon do not take <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">par atque idem periculum</i>
as meaning ‘an exactly similar danger’ (to that which Caesar
described in the preceding sentence, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Toto hoc ... contenderent</i>), but
as meaning that the danger which beset the Romans was the same
whether they pursued or retreated. Now the Roman infantry, as
Caesar says, did not pursue; obviously therefore <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et cedentibus et
insequentibus</i> can only refer to the Roman cavalry. I suppose
then that what Köchly, Rüstow, and Napoleon meant was this:&mdash;if
the Roman cavalry pursued the Britons, they were attacked by
the charioteers, who jumped off their cars and fought as infantry:
as soon as they retreated they were pursued by the British cavalry,
and if they turned to bay the charioteers had time to mount their
cars again, come up, and engage them anew. If this was what
Caesar meant by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equestris ... inferebat</i>, his language was not lucid.</p>

<p>The words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equestris proelii ratio</i>, if they were really written by
Caesar, must refer either to a combat between the Roman and the
British cavalry or to a combat between the Roman cavalry
and the combined British charioteers and cavalry. There is,
as we have seen, no reason to suppose that a purely cavalry combat
took place; and if it did, the idea that the Roman cavalry
was as much in danger when it pursued as when it retreated is
absurd. If we accept the other alternative, the meaning of the
passage must be either (as Köchly, Rüstow, and Napoleon explain)
‘<i>On the other hand</i>, the mode in which the British <i>cavalry</i> fought (in
co-operation with the charioteers) exposed the Romans, alike in
retreat and in pursuit, to exactly the same danger’; or ‘<i>In fact</i> the
nature of the combat of horse [that is to say, the combat between
the Roman cavalry and the combined British charioteers and cavalry]
exposed the Romans’, &amp;c. In the former case <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">autem</i> would be an
adversative, in the latter merely a connecting particle. The passage
is not in the <cite>editio princeps</cite> of the <cite>Commentaries</cite>, and is bracketed in
Meusel’s edition; and perhaps it is an interpolation.

<h2 id="PII_Pg692a">THE COMBAT BETWEEN TREBONIUS AND
THE BRITONS</h2>

<p>‘At midday Caesar having sent three legions and all his cavalry
on a foraging expedition under one of his generals, Gaius Trebonius,
they [the enemy] suddenly swooped down from all points on the
foragers, not hesitating to attack the ordered ranks of the legions’
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Sed meridie cum Caesar pabulandi causa tres legiones atque omnem
equitatum cum C. Trebonio legato misisset, repente ex omnibus partibus</i>
[hostes] <i>ad pabulatores advolaverunt, sic uti ab signis legionibusque
non absisterent</i></span><a id="FNanchor_3477" href="#Footnote_3477" class="fnanchor">3477</a>). To a plain man these words are perfectly intelligible;
and no military commentator, so far as I know, has ever
found any difficulty in them: but Kraner<a id="FNanchor_3478" href="#Footnote_3478" class="fnanchor">3478</a> must needs rewrite the
last clause. This is what he makes of it:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sicubi ab signis legionibusque
absisterent</i>. So, according to Kraner, the enemy attacked
the foragers at every point where they were separated from the
legions. The unpractical fellow fails to perceive that, as the foragers
could not forage while they were in their ranks, there was no point
where they were not separated from the legions. The legions, or
rather a due proportion of the cohorts which composed them, were
there to protect the foragers; and of course what Caesar means is
that the enemy, flushed with their easy success in driving off the
foragers and compelling them to rejoin their respective cohorts, had
the temerity to attack the cohorts themselves.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="PII_Pg692b">WHERE DID CAESAR CROSS THE THAMES?</h2>

<p>The only indications which Caesar gives as to the place where he
crossed the Thames are these. At an early stage of his narrative
he tells us that ‘the chief command and the general direction of the
campaign had been entrusted by common consent to Cassivellaunus,
whose territories are separated from those of the maritime tribes
by a river called the Thames, about eighty miles [or seventy-three
English miles] from the sea’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summa imperii bellique administrandi
communi consilio permissa Cassivellauno, cuius fines a maritimis
civitatibus flumen dividit, quod appellatur Tamesis, a mari circiter
milia passuum LXXX</i><a id="FNanchor_3479" href="#Footnote_3479" class="fnanchor">3479</a>). In a later chapter he describes his passage
of the river. ‘Having ascertained the enemy’s plans, Caesar led
his army to the Thames, into the territories of Cassivellaunus. The
river can only be forded at one spot, and there with difficulty. On
reaching this place, he observed that the enemy were drawn up in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_693">693</span>
great force near the opposite bank of the river. The bank was fenced
by sharp stakes planted along its edge; and similar stakes were
fixed under water, and concealed by the river. Having learned
these facts from prisoners and deserters, Caesar sent his cavalry on
in front, and ordered the legions to follow them speedily; but the
men advanced with such swiftness and dash, though they only had
their heads above water, that the enemy, unable to withstand the
combined onset of infantry and cavalry, quitted the bank and fled.’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caesar, cognito consilio eorum, ad flumen Tamesim in fines Cassivellauni

<p>When Caesar says that the Thames was only fordable at one spot,
he evidently means that there was only one ford available for his
purpose, that is to say, only one by which he could cross the river
into the territories of Cassivellaunus. When he says that these
territories were separated from those of the maritime tribes by the
Thames, about 80 miles from the sea, he means, I suppose, that
it was 80 miles from the place where he landed to the eastern frontier
of Cassivellaunus; but, according to some commentators, he
reckoned the distance from the place where he landed to the point
at which he crossed the river. Heller<a id="FNanchor_3481" href="#Footnote_3481" class="fnanchor">3481</a> insists that his statement
of the distance was based upon hearsay: I am inclined to believe
that it was a rough estimate based upon the number of the marches
which he made.</p>

<p>1. The view which has gained most adherents is that Caesar
crossed the Thames at ‘Coway Stakes’, about a furlong west of
Walton Bridge. It has been said that this view is based upon
a ‘tradition which has certainly prevailed for many ages’;<a id="FNanchor_3482" href="#Footnote_3482" class="fnanchor">3482</a> but
I can find no evidence that the tradition existed before the publication
of Camden’s <cite>Britannia</cite>; and I believe that it was created by
him. Camden<a id="FNanchor_3483" href="#Footnote_3483" class="fnanchor">3483</a> referred, in support of his conjecture, to a well-known
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_694">694</span>
passage in Bede;<a id="FNanchor_3484" href="#Footnote_3484" class="fnanchor">3484</a> but Bede did not mention Coway Stakes
at all. He merely said that, at the point of the river where the
enemy had planted their stakes, the stakes were still to be seen,
and that they were as thick as a man’s thigh and cased with lead.
S. Gale<a id="FNanchor_3485" href="#Footnote_3485" class="fnanchor">3485</a> affirms, in support of Camden’s view, that there is ‘a large
Roman encampment ... about a mile and a half distant from the
ford’. This camp, which is on St. George’s Hill, is really about
two miles and three-quarters<a id="FNanchor_3486" href="#Footnote_3486" class="fnanchor">3486</a> from the place where the ford is
assumed to have been. It is not Roman, but British; but even if
it were Roman, the fact would throw no light upon the question
which we are discussing unless the camp could be proved to have
been constructed by Caesar. Daines Barrington, an antiquary
of the eighteenth century, made an attempt, which, at first sight,
would appear completely successful, to demolish Camden’s theory.<a id="FNanchor_3487" href="#Footnote_3487" class="fnanchor">3487</a>
A fisherman of Shepperton, he tells us, rowed him across the river
in the line along which the stakes had been planted. He illustrated
his story by a sketch-plan, which shows that the stakes were at right
angles with the river-banks; and, he argues, ‘such stakes could not
possibly have obstructed the passage of an army.’ In reply it has
been asserted that ‘the line of the ford was not transversely straight
across the stream, but formed a curve nearly in a semi-circle, so
that ... the stakes must have twice intercepted the passage’;<a id="FNanchor_3488" href="#Footnote_3488" class="fnanchor">3488</a> but
who will believe that Caesar would have attempted the passage of
the river, which, as he tells us, was barely practicable, by a ford so
intricate as this? A more effective answer might be based upon
the fact, attested by Lord Wolseley,<a id="FNanchor_3489" href="#Footnote_3489" class="fnanchor">3489</a> that fords ‘almost always run
diagonally across the river’: if the ford by which Caesar crossed was
no exception, stakes planted in the direction indicated by Barrington
would obviously have obstructed the passage. Dr. Guest has made
another and most ingenious attempt to remove the difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_3490" href="#Footnote_3490" class="fnanchor">3490</a> He
believes that the stakes which impeded Caesar’s advance had not
been planted for the purpose of stopping him, but had existed for
many years. ‘I think,’ he says, ‘the stakes formed part of what
may be called a fortified ford, and were distributed so as to stop all
transit ... save along a narrow passage, which would bring the
passenger directly under the command of the watch, stationed on
the northern bank to ... receive the toll. The shallow at Coway
was probably of considerable extent, and through its whole length
must have extended the line of stakes which Caesar observed on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_695">695</span>
northern bank. But there must also have been two other lines of
stakes across the river to ... define the passage.’<a id="FNanchor_3491" href="#Footnote_3491" class="fnanchor">3491</a> The stakes to
which Barrington referred were, in Guest’s opinion, the remains of
these. ‘The remaining portion,’ he continues, ‘of the shallow was,
no doubt, covered with the short stakes that were “concealed by
the river” ... that such was really the disposition of the stakes may,
I think, be gathered, not only from the reports of the fishermen, but
also from Caesar’s narrative. When he saw the Britons ranged
along the northern bank with the stakes in front of them, he ordered
the cavalry to pass the river, and the legions to follow them. How
could either cavalry or infantry cross the river if the stakes were
ranged as our antiquaries assume them to have been? ... Besides,
what were the Britons doing while the Roman soldiers were removing
the stakes? ... Caesar says not a word about taking the Britons in
flank, nor about removing the stakes.’<a id="FNanchor_3492" href="#Footnote_3492" class="fnanchor">3492</a></p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be thought that Guest has succeeded in showing
that the particular objection which Barrington raised against
Camden’s theory is not necessarily insuperable. If, however, the
stakes to which Barrington referred were the remains of those which
had served, on Guest’s theory, to ‘define the passage’, the ford in
question was an exception to the rule that fords ‘almost always run
diagonally across the river’. Again, Guest argues that because
‘Caesar says not a word about ... removing the stakes’, therefore
the Romans did not remove them. But it is needless to insist that
they must have removed them, unless at the particular part of the
‘shallow’ by which they crossed there were none to remove. Guest,
therefore, is obliged to make the incredible assumption that the
Britons, having left intact the stakes which ‘defined the passage’,
and having thus pointed out to the Romans the best way of crossing
the river, were so obliging as to plant no stakes to bar this passage
either in the bed of the river or on the bank, while they planted them
everywhere else.</p>

<p>Guest undertakes to prove not only that Coway Stakes may, but
that it must have been the spot at which Caesar crossed the Thames.
‘From the Coway Stakes,’ he says, ‘the ground rises gradually for
about three miles, and then dips almost precipitously into the valley
of the Wey. On the top of the hill [St. George’s Hill] is an ancient
British stronghold which commands the whole valley, and as the
valley certainly belonged to the Atrebates, I infer that ... this
people constructed the fortress. Aubrey tells us that “a trench”
went from this fortress to Walton, and gave that village its name.
A dyke still runs from the ramparts towards Walton. I have traced
it for more than one-third of the distance, and I have no doubt
that it once reached the village ... <i>The ditch is towards the river</i>.
For what purpose could this dyke have been made? The only
object for which I can conceive it was made, was to bar progress
along the trackway which led from the Coway Stakes eastward to
the maritime states. If such were its object, we have another strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_696">696</span>
proof that the great means of access to the country of Cassivellaunus
was at the spot where Camden placed it.’<a id="FNanchor_3493" href="#Footnote_3493" class="fnanchor">3493</a> Nor is this all. ‘From
Hurleyford,’ says Guest, ‘to the sea, a distance of nearly 100 miles,
taking into account the windings of the river, there is but one place
on the banks of the Thames bearing a name which indicates a ford
over it.<a id="FNanchor_3494" href="#Footnote_3494" class="fnanchor">3494</a> This solitary place is Halliford, at the Coway Stakes.
Caesar says there was but one ford on the Thames&mdash;meaning, of
course, the lower Thames, with which alone he was acquainted,
and we now have but one place on its banks, the name of which
points to the existence of a ford. Our topography is in perfect
agreement with his statement; and, to my mind, this coincidence
is almost decisive of the question.’<a id="FNanchor_3495" href="#Footnote_3495" class="fnanchor">3495</a> We shall see.</p>

<p>2. Colonel Stoffel, by whose advice Napoleon was mainly guided
in his attempts to solve the topographical problems presented by
the <cite>Commentaries</cite>, was informed by the Thames boatmen whom
he consulted that between Shepperton and London there were eight
or nine fords, the most favourable of which was at Sunbury; and
here accordingly the Emperor concluded that Caesar had crossed
the river. Still he (or the colonel) was sagacious enough to doubt.
‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La seule chose,</span>’ he wrote, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui nous paraisse evidente, c’est que
l’armee romaine n’a point passe en aval de Teddington.</span>’<a id="FNanchor_3496" href="#Footnote_3496" class="fnanchor">3496</a></p>

<p>But even this conclusion rested upon a rotten foundation. The
Emperor, as Guest<a id="FNanchor_3497" href="#Footnote_3497" class="fnanchor">3497</a> observes, ‘reasons from the present to the past
without taking any note of the changes that have occurred during
2,000 years. In the time of Caesar the river ran ... to the sea
uninterruptedly. <i>Now</i>, from Teddington westward it is a canal,
crossed every two or three miles by weirs and locks ... as the lock
[at Teddington] did not exist in the time of Caesar, any inference
drawn from the fact that the tide now ends there, is beside the
question.’ And, to quote Guest again, ‘the shallow at Sunbury
is a mere consequence of Sunbury weir. Remove the weir, and
Caesar’s ford at Sunbury would be swept away in a twelvemonth
by the natural scour of the river.’ Guest<a id="FNanchor_3498" href="#Footnote_3498" class="fnanchor">3498</a> thought it probable
that ‘when the river was in its natural state, spring-tides ran up
the river eight or nine miles further [than they do now]&mdash;in other
words, to Coway: and that the deposit which they now leave at
Teddington then contributed to form the shallow over which Caesar
passed.’ Mr. F. C. J. Spurrell, on the other hand, has given reasons
for believing that ‘the estuary did not reach so far west as at the
present day’.<a id="FNanchor_3499" href="#Footnote_3499" class="fnanchor">3499</a></p>

<p>3. Von Goler<a id="FNanchor_3500" href="#Footnote_3500" class="fnanchor">3500</a> peremptorily decides that the ford was ‘undoubtedly
at Kingston’. An English engineer, he tells us, informed
him that the depth of the water there was only from 3½ to 4½ feet;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_697">697</span>
and he remarks further that Kingston is just 80 Roman miles from
the sea. If the engineer whom he consulted could have informed
him that the depth of the water at Kingston was the same in 54 <small>B.C.</small>
as at the time when he sounded it, his information would have been
more valuable. Assuming that the tide in Caesar’s time, as now,
did not flow beyond Teddington, W. H. Black may have been justified
in saying that Kingston ‘presents geographically the most favourable
place for crossing the Thames’ to an invader coming from the neighbourhood
of Deal.<a id="FNanchor_3501" href="#Footnote_3501" class="fnanchor">3501</a> But we must not assume that Caesar crossed
the Thames at the place which was ‘geographically the most
favourable’: he could not pick and choose; he had to cross where
there was a ford, and there was only one.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the Thames has, at various times and at
certain states of the tide, been fordable at Westminster,<a id="FNanchor_3502" href="#Footnote_3502" class="fnanchor">3502</a> at Chelsea,<a id="FNanchor_3503" href="#Footnote_3503" class="fnanchor">3503</a>
at Old Brentford,<a id="FNanchor_3504" href="#Footnote_3504" class="fnanchor">3504</a> and at Petersham;<a id="FNanchor_3505" href="#Footnote_3505" class="fnanchor">3505</a> and the claims of these
places have been advocated by zealous antiquaries: but, with one
exception, which I shall notice presently, I do not recommend
students of the <cite>Commentaries</cite> to read what they have written. As
Guest points out, ‘the name of Brentford had no reference to a ford
over the Thames; it certainly designated the ford over the Brent
by which the Roman road from London to Staines crossed the
latter river.’<a id="FNanchor_3506" href="#Footnote_3506" class="fnanchor">3506</a> Moreover, the fact that the Thames has occasionally
been crossed on foot at various points near London proves nothing:
these cases, as Guest truly says, were exceptional, and were recorded
because they were exceptional; ‘Caesar,’ he concludes, ‘knew the
river in its natural state, and had ... adequate means of acquiring
knowledge ... he tells us distinctly that the Thames was passable
on foot only in one place.’<a id="FNanchor_3507" href="#Footnote_3507" class="fnanchor">3507</a></p>

<p>The claims of Brentford have, however, recently been advocated
by Mr. Montagu Sharpe in a pamphlet which contains some real
evidence. From information supplied by Messrs. W. S. Bunting
and W. Benell of the Thames Conservancy, and by Conservancy
Inspector G. J. Rough, he shows that a line of stakes, of which
some still remain ‘for about 400 yards below Isleworth Ferry,’
extended thirty years ago for about a mile up the river from ‘Old
England’, opposite the mouth of the Brent; and that ‘no other
ancient stakes have been discovered in the lower river during
dredging operations’.<a id="FNanchor_3508" href="#Footnote_3508" class="fnanchor">3508</a></p>

<p>Except Coway Stakes and Brentford, there is no spot in the
Thames valley for the identification of which with the scene of
Caesar’s exploit a shred of real argument has been advanced.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_698">698</span>
Guest’s arguments are of very unequal value; but the one which
he founds upon the name ‘Halliford’ is worth considering, though
it would be going too far to say that it is ‘almost decisive of the
question’. The claim which Mr. Sharpe makes for his own discovery
rests upon somewhat better grounds. [See Addenda, p. 742.]</p>

<h2 id="PII_Pg698">CAESAR’S PASSAGE OF THE THAMES</h2>

<p>The excessively laconic chapter in which Caesar describes how he
crossed the Thames in the face of a British force seems at first sight
hard to explain. He tells us that ‘the river can only be forded at
one spot, and there with difficulty’. ‘On reaching this place,’ he
continues, ‘he observed that the enemy were drawn up in great
force near the opposite bank of the river. The bank was fenced
by sharp stakes planted along its edge; and similar stakes were
fixed under water and concealed by the river. Having learned
these facts from prisoners and deserters, Caesar sent his cavalry on
in front, and ordered the legions to follow them speedily; but the men
advanced with such swiftness and dash, though they only had their
heads above water, that the enemy, unable to withstand the combined
onset of infantry and cavalry, quitted the bank and fled’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod flumen uno omnino loco pedibus, atque hoc aegre, transiri potest.

<p>Von Göler<a id="FNanchor_3510" href="#Footnote_3510" class="fnanchor">3510</a> explains the passage as follows:&mdash;‘he first sent his
cavalry against the enemy, making them swim across the adjacent
part of the river, which, though deeper, was not barricaded, and
by their attack so effectually protected the passage of the infantry,
which was begun immediately afterwards, that they gained time
to remove the stakes’; and in a note<a id="FNanchor_3511" href="#Footnote_3511" class="fnanchor">3511</a> he says, ‘Only in this way
can the expression <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praemisso equitatu confestim legiones subsequi
iussit</i> be understood, for the cavalry could by no possibility swim
across or disregard the stakes or the palisade.’ This explanation,
as far as it goes, is substantially identical with that of Turpin de
Crissé,<a id="FNanchor_3512" href="#Footnote_3512" class="fnanchor">3512</a> who supposes, further, that while part of the Roman infantry
cut down the stakes in the river, they were supported by their
comrades in the rear, who discharged missiles against the enemy,
and, he might have added, by the auxiliary troops,&mdash;slingers and
archers. Napoleon the Third<a id="FNanchor_3513" href="#Footnote_3513" class="fnanchor">3513</a> hardly differs from his predecessors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_699">699</span>
in suggesting that the cavalry were sent ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à une certaine distance en
amont ou en aval</i>’. Mr. A. G. Peskett<a id="FNanchor_3514" href="#Footnote_3514" class="fnanchor">3514</a> objects to Napoleon’s
explanation on the ground that it involves a mistranslation of the
word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praemittit</i>, which, he insists, ‘must mean that Caesar sent the
cavalry across the river, ordering the infantry to follow them.’
Mr. Peskett evidently means that the infantry crossed directly in
the rear of the cavalry. But, as any soldier would tell Mr. Peskett,
the operation which he supposes would have been absolutely impossible;
and, moreover, his rigidly literal interpretation of the word
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praemisso</i>, which is not shared by that competent Caesarian scholar,
C. Schneider, is irreconcilable with the word <i>sed</i>, which opens the
next sentence. This word, as Schneider<a id="FNanchor_3515" href="#Footnote_3515" class="fnanchor">3515</a> remarks, is intended to
show that the infantry, in their ardour, outvied the cavalry, and
crossed the river before them. The use of the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praemisso</i> may
surely be defended if the cavalry were sent into the water before
the infantry. Similarly it will be evident to any one who carefully
reads the last two sentences in the twenty-fifth chapter of Caesar’s
Fourth Book<a id="FNanchor_3516" href="#Footnote_3516" class="fnanchor">3516</a> that the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subsecuti</i> cannot there mean ‘following
directly in rear’. For in that case ‘the nearest ships’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proximis
navibus</i>), the troops in which jumped into the sea and followed
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subsecuti</i>) their comrades, would have been drawn up in a second
line <i>behind</i> the other ships. If so, being in deeper water, they evidently
could not have been run aground; and the soldiers who
descended from them would have been drowned.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="PII_Pg699">THE SITE OF CASSIVELLAUNUS’S
STRONGHOLD</h2>

<p>The indications which Caesar gives as to the geographical position
of the stronghold of Cassivellaunus are of the vaguest kind. After
describing his passage from the southern to the northern bank of
the Thames, which brought him into the territory of Cassivellaunus,
he gives the following account of his operations:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Cassivellaunus, abandoning, as we have remarked above,<a id="FNanchor_3517" href="#Footnote_3517" class="fnanchor">3517</a> all
thoughts of regular combat, disbanded all his forces, except some
four thousand charioteers, watched our line of march, and, moving
a little away from the track, concealed himself in impenetrable
wooded spots, and removed the cattle and inhabitants from the
open country into the woods in those districts through which he had
learned that we intended to march. Whenever our cavalry made
a bold dash into the country to plunder and devastate, he sent his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_700">700</span>
charioteers out of the woods (for he was familiar with every track
and path), engaged our cavalry to their great peril, and by the
terror which he thus inspired prevented them from moving far afield.
Caesar had now no choice but to forbid them to move out of touch
with the column of infantry, and, by ravaging the country and
burning villages, to injure the enemy as far as the legionaries’ powers
of endurance would allow.</p>

<p>‘Meanwhile the Trinovantes&mdash;about the strongest tribe in that
part of the country&mdash;sent envoys to Caesar, promising to surrender
and obey his commands. Mandubracius, a young chief of this tribe,
whose father had been their king and had been put to death by
Cassivellaunus, but who had saved his own life by flight, had gone
to the Continent to join Caesar, and thrown himself upon his protection.
The Trinovantes begged Caesar to protect Mandubracius
from harm at the hands of Cassivellaunus and to send him to rule
over his own people with full powers. Caesar sent Mandubracius,
but ordered them to furnish forty hostages and grain for his army.
They promptly obeyed his commands, sending hostages to the number
required and also the grain.</p>

<p>‘As the Trinovantes had been granted protection and immunity
from all injury on the part of the soldiers, the Cenimagni, Segontiaci,
Ancalites, Bibroci, and Cassi sent embassies to Caesar and surrendered.
He learned from the envoys that the stronghold of Cassivellaunus,
which was protected by woods and marshes, was not far off,
and that a considerable number of men and of cattle had assembled
in it. The Britons apply the name of stronghold to any woodland
spot, difficult of access and fortified with a rampart and trench, to
which they are in the habit of resorting in order to escape a hostile
raid. Caesar marched to the spot indicated with his legions, and
found that the place was of great natural strength and well fortified:
nevertheless he proceeded to assault it on two sides. The enemy
stood their ground a short time, but could not sustain the onset
of our infantry, and fled precipitately from another part of the
stronghold.’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cassivellaunus, ut supra demonstravimus, omni deposita

<p>1. Many commentators have identified the stronghold with
Verulam, or Verulamium, which was situated immediately west of
St. Albans.<a id="FNanchor_3519" href="#Footnote_3519" class="fnanchor">3519</a> The arguments which can be adduced in support of
this view are that marshes might have been formed by the river Ver;
that Verulamium, under Tasciovanus, who began to reign not later
than 30 <small>B.C.</small>, was the chief town of Catuvellauni; and that the
territory of the Catuvellauni belonged to Cassivellaunus.</p>

<p>2. Others point to Cassiobury in Hertfordshire.<a id="FNanchor_3520" href="#Footnote_3520" class="fnanchor">3520</a> Cassiobury,
they argue, evidently preserves the name of the Cassi,<a id="FNanchor_3521" href="#Footnote_3521" class="fnanchor">3521</a> who were as
evidently subject to Cassivellaunus.</p>

<p>3. Von Göler<a id="FNanchor_3522" href="#Footnote_3522" class="fnanchor">3522</a> remarks that, ‘judging from the configuration and
nature of the terrain,’ the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oppidium</i> ‘may be the hill lying on the
south-western side of Wendover’. May be, or may be not; for
Caesar’s vague description of ‘the configuration and nature of the
terrain’ would apply to other sites as well.</p>

<p>4. The most interesting theory is that of T. Lewin,<a id="FNanchor_3523" href="#Footnote_3523" class="fnanchor">3523</a> who maintains
that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oppidium</i> was no other that London, that is to say, the
settlement which many writers believe to have existed long before
the Roman conquest, in the neighbourhood of Ludgate Hill. As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_702">702</span>
Cassivellaunus, he argues, had conquered the Trinovantes,<a id="FNanchor_3524" href="#Footnote_3524" class="fnanchor">3524</a> ‘whose
western border was the Lea,’ we may assume that his dominions
extended westward from that river, and comprised Middlesex and
Hertford. As Caesar says that he prohibited his soldiers from
plundering the Trinovantes, it is clear that, after crossing the
Thames, he marched into Essex. There he learned that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oppidum</i>
of Cassivellaunus was not far off; and ‘this situation answers to
London’. Moreover British London, which was situated on the
rising ground between Ludgate and Dowgate, and protected on the
south by the marshes of the Thames, on the west by the marshes
of the river Flete, and on the east by the marshes of the river
Wallbrook, was just such a stronghold as Caesar described.</p>

<p>Who would not accept such an attractive theory if he could only
give rein to his imagination? But unhappily the very existence,
in 54 <small>B.C</small>., of British London is matter of inference and conjecture,
however reasonable.<a id="FNanchor_3525" href="#Footnote_3525" class="fnanchor">3525</a> And is it reasonable to assume that if the
stronghold which Caesar captured had been situated on the banks
of the Thames he would have neglected to mention the fact?</p>

<p>5. W. H. Black<a id="FNanchor_3526" href="#Footnote_3526" class="fnanchor">3526</a> argues that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oppidum</i> was most probably
somewhere in ‘the woody lands about Pinner, Harrow, and Cashiobury
Park.’</p>

<p>6. The Reverend H. Jenkins<a id="FNanchor_3527" href="#Footnote_3527" class="fnanchor">3527</a> maintains that it was in Essex;
for, he argues, in order to fulfil the compact which he had made
with the Trinovantes, Caesar’s ‘chief object, after he had crossed
the Thames, must have been to lead his army into Essex’. Certainly
Caesar’s army, or a part of it, must have entered the country of the
Trinovantes; for, as we have seen, he would not allow his soldiers
to plunder that people. Jenkins’s theory is demolished by Caesar’s
statement that the stronghold belonged to Cassivellaunus, which
shows that it was not in the territory of the Trinovantes. And since,
immediately after the sentence in which he tells us that he prohibited
his soldiers from plundering the Trinovantes, he goes on to say that
the stronghold of Cassivellaunus was not far off, it is fair to conclude
that it was near the common frontier of the Trinovantes and of
Cassivellaunus.<a id="FNanchor_3528" href="#Footnote_3528" class="fnanchor">3528</a> Of the places which fulfil this condition more can
be said for Verulam than for any other; but its identity with the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oppidum</i> in question has not been proved.

<h2 id="PII_Pg703">DID <i>LONDINIUM</i> EXIST IN CAESAR’S TIME?</h2>

<p>The earliest mention of London occurs in the <cite>Annals</cite><a id="FNanchor_3529" href="#Footnote_3529" class="fnanchor">3529</a> of Tacitus,
who, describing the events of the year 61, speaks of it as a busy
centre of commerce. It has been argued<a id="FNanchor_3530" href="#Footnote_3530" class="fnanchor">3530</a> that a settlement existed
there before the Roman conquest of Britain, because the name
<i>Londinium</i> is Celtic. Lewin<a id="FNanchor_3531" href="#Footnote_3531" class="fnanchor">3531</a> maintains further that if London had
been founded by the Romans, it would have been a strong military
post, whereas in 61, eighteen years after the invasion of Britain by
Aulus Plautius, it was attacked by the Iceni and Trinovantes because
it was defenceless and wealthy.<a id="FNanchor_3532" href="#Footnote_3532" class="fnanchor">3532</a> ‘It must,’ he insists, ‘have attained
to this height of prosperity, not under the Romans, who did
not patronise it, but by the silent progress of trade, a work that
could not ... have been accomplished in ... 19 years.’ ‘We know,’
he continues, referring to Dion Cassius,<a id="FNanchor_3533" href="#Footnote_3533" class="fnanchor">3533</a> ‘that Camulodunum was
a flourishing British city before the ... time of Plautius, and, if so,
London, which enjoyed far greater advantages, must also have been
a British city.’ Lewin holds that this city stood upon the hill
between the river Flete and the Wallbrook. On the west was <i>Lud</i>gate,
the name of which is Celtic: on the east Dowgate,&mdash;‘a corruption
of the Celtic Dwrgate or water-gate.’ The river Flete, or
Fleet, entered the Thames just below the site of Blackfriars Bridge;
while at Dowgate, about 1,000 yards to the east, was the mouth of the
Wallbrook.<a id="FNanchor_3534" href="#Footnote_3534" class="fnanchor">3534</a></p>

<p>Mr. W. J. Loftie<a id="FNanchor_3535" href="#Footnote_3535" class="fnanchor">3535</a> finds the site of British London on the western
side of the Wallbrook. In his <cite>History of London</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_3536" href="#Footnote_3536" class="fnanchor">3536</a> however, he
affirmed that the British settlement stood ‘on the eastern hill [that
is to say, on the gently rising ground east of the Wallbrook], if
anywhere’. Canon Isaac Taylor<a id="FNanchor_3537" href="#Footnote_3537" class="fnanchor">3537</a> asserts that the British hill-fort
was ‘formed by Tower Hill, Cornhill, and Ludgate Hill, and effectually
protected by the Thames ... the Fleet ... the great fen of Moorfields
and Finsbury’, &amp;c. Seeing that it has been proved that ‘the
great fen’ did not exist in Roman times,<a id="FNanchor_3538" href="#Footnote_3538" class="fnanchor">3538</a> and that the very existence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_704">704</span>
of the British hill-fort can as yet only be inferred, it is plainly useless
to attempt to determine its site.</p>

<p>Dr. Guest<a id="FNanchor_3539" href="#Footnote_3539" class="fnanchor">3539</a> holds that ‘the notion ... that a British town preceded
the Roman camp [of Aulus Plautius] has no foundation ... and is
inconsistent with all we know of the early geography of this part
of Britain.’ ‘Such town,’ he adds, ‘could not have belonged to
the Trinobantes, for it lay beyond their natural limits, nor to the
settled district of the Catuvellauni, for then Caesar’s statement that
the Thames divided their country from the maritime states “about
eighty miles from the sea” would be grossly inaccurate.’ I cannot
see the force of these arguments. ‘The notion that a British town
preceded the Roman camp’ <i>has</i> a foundation,&mdash;the solid foundation
of etymology. <i>London</i> is indisputably a Celtic name;<a id="FNanchor_3540" href="#Footnote_3540" class="fnanchor">3540</a> and if
London had been founded by the Romans, why should it have had
a <i>purely</i> Celtic name<a id="FNanchor_3541" href="#Footnote_3541" class="fnanchor">3541</a> at all, and why should its Celtic name have
outlasted <i>Augusta</i>,&mdash;the name which the Romans gave to their
London? Assuming that Caesar’s statement is to be interpreted
in the sense which Dr. Guest attaches to it, the distance by road of
British London from Sandwich, in the neighbourhood of which
Caesar landed,<a id="FNanchor_3542" href="#Footnote_3542" class="fnanchor">3542</a> is 67 English miles, or nearly 73 Roman miles. Is
the difference between 73 and ‘about 80’ so great as to justify the
use of the words ‘grossly inaccurate’?</p>

<p>More recently John Richard Green has endeavoured to disprove
the existence of British London.<a id="FNanchor_3543" href="#Footnote_3543" class="fnanchor">3543</a> ‘Much,’ he says, ‘has been made
of its name, but “Llyn-dyn” ... is as likely to be the designation of
a spot as of a town on it. An almost conclusive proof, however, that
no such town existed west of the [river] Fleet may be drawn from
the line of the old British road from Kent (the predecessor of the
Watling Street), which, instead of crossing the river as in Roman and
later times at the point marked by London Bridge, passed, according
to Higden, to a point opposite Westminster ... (Loftie, “Roman
London”, Archaeological Journal, volume xxxiv, page 165) ... the
rise of such a town [Roman London] is the best explanation of the
later change in the line of this road.’</p>

<p>‘According to Higden!’ According to the monk of the fourteenth
century who wrote the <cite>Polychronicon</cite>! And Higden does not so
much as mention ‘the old British road from Kent’,&mdash;a road the
very existence of which can only be conjectured. What he says is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_705">705</span>
that ‘Watlingstrete’ crossed the Thames west of Westminster;<a id="FNanchor_3544" href="#Footnote_3544" class="fnanchor">3544</a>
and Mr. Loftie, to whom Green appeals, affirms that he is ‘driven to
the conclusion that there was a British town’.<a id="FNanchor_3545" href="#Footnote_3545" class="fnanchor">3545</a> Accepting the statement
of Higden, he argues that the ‘Watlingstrete’ which is said
to have crossed the Thames west of Westminster was a pre-Roman
road and followed the line of Park Lane and Edgware Road. I will
only add that, having failed to discover any paper worth reading
about the direction of Watling Street in that part of its course which
passed through or by Roman London, I consulted Professor Haverfield.
‘I know nothing satisfactory,’ he replied, ‘about the line of
Watling Street, and nothing to suggest that it existed before <small>A.D.</small> 43.’</p>

<p>The very large number of palaeolithic implements which have been
found in London and its environs prove that in the earliest times it
was a centre of population;<a id="FNanchor_3546" href="#Footnote_3546" class="fnanchor">3546</a> but it would hardly be safe to infer
from the discoveries of bronze and iron tools and weapons and of
British coins<a id="FNanchor_3547" href="#Footnote_3547" class="fnanchor">3547</a> that the Romans found a town on the site. If there
was such a town, it certainly had little political importance; for
while numerous British coins issued from the mints of Verulamium
and Camulodunum, not one has been discovered which bears the name
of Londinium.<a id="FNanchor_3548" href="#Footnote_3548" class="fnanchor">3548</a> Nevertheless it may reasonably be affirmed that
London existed before the Roman conquest: first, because the same
advantages that attracted the traders of Rome would also have
commended themselves to those of Britain; and secondly, I repeat,
because it is improbable that a Celtic name would have been given
to a town which the Romans had built upon a virgin site.<a id="FNanchor_3549" href="#Footnote_3549" class="fnanchor">3549</a>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="PII_Pg706">THE JULIAN CALENDAR AND THE
CHRONOLOGY OF CAESAR’S INVASIONS
OF BRITAIN</h2>

<p>I. The chronology of Caesar’s first invasion of Britain is simple
enough, so far as it can be ascertained, and requires no knowledge
of the intricacies of the Roman calendar. I have shown in an earlier
article that the disembarkation took place on the 26th or 27th of
August, 55 <small>B.C.</small><a id="FNanchor_3550" href="#Footnote_3550" class="fnanchor">3550</a> After describing the storm which occurred on the
night of August 30-31, and the consequent loss of many of his ships,
Caesar goes on to say that the Britons endeavoured to protract the
war by cutting off his supplies, and that he had corn brought in daily
from the open country into his camp, and ordered the materials
necessary for the repair of those ships which were only partially
damaged to be fetched from the Continent. While the ships were
being repaired an attack was made upon the 7th legion, which was
engaged in cutting corn. This attack evidently took place several
days after the 31st of August; for the field in which the legion was
reaping was the only one accessible from the camp in which the
corn had not been cut. The day on which the legion was attacked
was followed by several days of stormy weather, during which all
military operations were suspended. At the end of this time the
Britons attacked the camp unsuccessfully, and on the same day
sued for peace, which Caesar granted on condition of their giving
hostages. Instead of waiting for the arrival of the hostages he
ordered the British chiefs to send them over to the Continent,
‘because the equinox was at hand, and he did not think it wise to
expose his unseaworthy ships to a voyage in stormy weather.’<a id="FNanchor_3551" href="#Footnote_3551" class="fnanchor">3551</a>
The equinox occurred on the 26th of September.<a id="FNanchor_3552" href="#Footnote_3552" class="fnanchor">3552</a> Our data, then, are
as follows:&mdash;the attack on the 7th legion occurred several days
after the 31st of August; and Caesar returned to Gaul several days
after the attack on the 7th legion, but before&mdash;probably several
days before&mdash;the 26th of September.<a id="FNanchor_3553" href="#Footnote_3553" class="fnanchor">3553</a> Let us say that he returned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_707">707</span>
about the middle of the month. Napoleon, to whom indefiniteness
was an abomination, fixed the 12th of September as the date.<a id="FNanchor_3554" href="#Footnote_3554" class="fnanchor">3554</a></p>

<p>II. If we were to believe certain writers of high reputation, we
should be deterred from attempting to fix any dates for the second
of Caesar’s expeditions; for our principal sources of information
are dates mentioned by Cicero in his letters; and, as everybody
knows, the Roman calendar, before Caesar’s reform, was often in
disagreement with the Julian calendar. The writers of the article
<small>CALENDARIUM</small> in Smith’s <cite>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities</cite><a id="FNanchor_3555" href="#Footnote_3555" class="fnanchor">3555</a>
affirm that ‘it is very difficult or rather quite impossible to determine
the actual dates which correspond to the nominal dates of any events
before the Julian reform of the calendar’. But for the period comprised
between the beginning of the year 696 (58 <small>B.C.</small>), just after
Caesar became Governor of Gaul, and his reform of the calendar,
which took effect in 709 (45 <small>B.C.</small>), this view is quite incorrect. Every
date in Cicero’s correspondence which relates to the subject of this
essay can be reduced, if not with absolute precision, at all events
with a possible error of not more than one day, to its corresponding
date in the Julian calendar. First of all, however, we must find out
the nature of the reform which Caesar initiated, and understand the
chronological disturbances which made reform necessary.</p>

<p>Every scholar knows that, after the period of the Decemvirate,
the Roman year consisted of 355 days only, and that every other
year an additional month, consisting alternately of 22 and 23 days,
was, or rather ought to have been, intercalated after the 23rd of
February. January, April, June, August, September, November,
and December each contained 29 days; February 28; and March,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_708">708</span>
May, July, and October 31. If I may remind the general reader
of what he learned at school, the first day of every month was called
the Kalends; the fifth day of January, February, April, June,
August, September, November, and December was called the Nones;
and the thirteenth day of each of those months was called the Ides.
But in March, May, July, and October the Nones were on the seventh,
and the Ides on the fifteenth day. In mentioning dates the Romans
described any given day as occurring so many days before the
Kalends, Nones, or Ides, as the case might be; and in so doing
they adopted the inclusive method of reckoning. Thus the last
day of December was called ‘the day before the Kalends of January’,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pridie Kalendas Ianuarias</i>, or shortly <i>prid. Kal. Ian</i>. But the
27th of December was called, not the third, but the fourth day before
the Kalends of January, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante diem quartum Kalendas Ianuarias</i>, or
shortly <i>a. d. IV Kal. Ian</i>.</p>

<p>To return to the month which was or ought to have been intercalated
every other year. As the ordinary year contained 355 days,
and the solar year was believed to contain 365¼ days, it is obvious
that to intercalate a month of 22 and 23 days alternately every other
year was to make an excessive correction, the excess amounting to
4 days in every period of 4 years. Macrobius<a id="FNanchor_3556" href="#Footnote_3556" class="fnanchor">3556</a> tells us that in order
to remedy this error, 24 days were omitted from every twenty-fourth
year. For various reasons, however, this regulation, if indeed it
ever really took effect,<a id="FNanchor_3557" href="#Footnote_3557" class="fnanchor">3557</a> was not always properly carried out; and
accordingly in the year of the city 563, or 191 <small>B.C.</small>, a reform was
introduced, the college of pontiffs being authorized to intercalate or
to omit intercalations at their discretion.<a id="FNanchor_3558" href="#Footnote_3558" class="fnanchor">3558</a> But this innovation, as
we learn from Cicero, Censorinus, and other writers, only made
matters worse. Speaking of the pontiffs, Censorinus complains
that ‘most of them, either from hatred or from favour, to cut short
or to extend the tenure of office, or that a farmer of the public
revenue might gain or lose more by the length of the year, by intercalating
more or less at their pleasure, deliberately made worse
what had been entrusted to them to set right’.<a id="FNanchor_3559" href="#Footnote_3559" class="fnanchor">3559</a></p>

<p>III. In 708 (46 <small>B.C.</small>), which is generally called ‘the year of confusion’,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_709">709</span>
Caesar intercalated a certain number of days, in order to
bring the calendar into harmony with the solar year before inaugurating
the reformed calendar in 709. It is expressly stated by
Asconius, whose testimony is unanimously accepted, that there was
an intercalary month in 702;<a id="FNanchor_3560" href="#Footnote_3560" class="fnanchor">3560</a> and it is admitted by all chronologists
that there was no other intercalary month in the seven years between
700 and 708.<a id="FNanchor_3561" href="#Footnote_3561" class="fnanchor">3561</a> There is no doubt that the Kalends of January, 709,
corresponded either with the 1st or the 2nd of January, 45 <small>B.C.</small> It
is clear, therefore, that when we have ascertained how many days
were intercalated in 708, we shall be able, by reckoning backwards,
to ascertain the correspondence of any given date in the summer
of 700, the year of Caesar’s second expedition, with the Julian
calendar,&mdash;with a possible error of one day only. This error will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_710">710</span>
be removed if we can ascertain whether the Kalends of January,
709, corresponded with the 1st or the 2nd of January, 45 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>All German scholars who have written upon Roman chronology
are agreed that ‘the year of confusion’ contained 445 days, in other
words, that 90 days, amounting to four ordinary intercalary months,
were intercalated; and they hold that these 90 days were actually
composed of three months, namely the <i>Mercedonius</i>, which, in the
ordinary course, should in that year have been intercalated immediately
after the 23rd of February, and two extraordinary months,
amounting to 67 days, which were intercalated between the last day
of November and the 1st of December. This view is supported in
every detail by Censorinus,<a id="FNanchor_3562" href="#Footnote_3562" class="fnanchor">3562</a> who wrote about 240 <small>A.D.</small> The principal
dissentients are De La Nauze, Napoleon the Third and his collaborator,
the famous astronomer, Le Verrier, who held that 67 days only
were intercalated in 708, and Colonel Stoffel, who, in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de
Jules César&mdash;Guerre civile</cite>, published in 1887, reaffirmed the same
view, but who does not appear to have informed himself of what any
of the Germans, except Ideler, had written on the subject. Moreover,
the theory of Napoleon, Le Verrier, and Colonel Stoffel is
frequently referred to by scholars in terms which imply that they
regard the question as still open. The reason which Le Verrier<a id="FNanchor_3563" href="#Footnote_3563" class="fnanchor">3563</a>
gives is that in 700 Caesar re-embarked his troops for the return
voyage from Britain to Gaul ‘because the equinox was at hand’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod aequinoctium suberat</i><a id="FNanchor_3564" href="#Footnote_3564" class="fnanchor">3564</a>); that the equinox actually took place
on the 26th of September of the Julian calendar; and that Caesar
informed Cicero on the sixth day before the Kalends of October
(which corresponded, on Le Verrier’s theory, with the 21st of
September) that he was on the point of bringing back the army.<a id="FNanchor_3565" href="#Footnote_3565" class="fnanchor">3565</a>
He remarks that, on the theory of Ideler (who, like all other German
scholars, held that 90 days were intercalated in 708), the sixth day
before the Kalends of October, 700, would have corresponded with
the 30th of August, 54 <small>B.C.</small>;<a id="FNanchor_3566" href="#Footnote_3566" class="fnanchor">3566</a> and he argues that this theory must
be wrong because Caesar would not have troubled himself about
the approach of the equinox 27 days before it occurred. He also
remarks that, although the view that 90 days were intercalated in
708 is supported by Suetonius<a id="FNanchor_3567" href="#Footnote_3567" class="fnanchor">3567</a> and Censorinus,<a id="FNanchor_3568" href="#Footnote_3568" class="fnanchor">3568</a> Dion Cassius<a id="FNanchor_3569" href="#Footnote_3569" class="fnanchor">3569</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_711">711</span>
affirmed that 67 days were intercalated, and that Dion expressly
added that other writers had asserted that a greater number had
been intercalated, but that his own statement was true; and he
insists that Dion derived his information from authentic sources.<a id="FNanchor_3570" href="#Footnote_3570" class="fnanchor">3570</a></p>

<p>It will be shown presently that if Le Verrier was right in his
interpretation of Dion’s words, Dion made a mistake. G. F. Unger<a id="FNanchor_3571" href="#Footnote_3571" class="fnanchor">3571</a>
holds that he misunderstood the authority from whom he borrowed
his statement, and ‘who, like Suetonius, unquestionably regarded
the month intercalated in February as an <i>ordinary</i> intercalary month’.
Von Göler,<a id="FNanchor_3572" href="#Footnote_3572" class="fnanchor">3572</a> on the other hand, holds that Dion was quite right; that
he was referring, not to the ordinary intercalary month, but only
to the two extraordinary months intercalated between November
and December, which amounted to 67 days; and therefore that his
statement tallies with that of Censorinus. Be this, however, as it
may, it is absolutely certain that more than 67 days were intercalated
in 708. For on the 16th of May, 705, Cicero wrote from Cumae,
‘At present the equinox is delaying us, which has been very stormy’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunc quidem aequinoctium nos moratur, quod valde perturbatum erat</i><a id="FNanchor_3573" href="#Footnote_3573" class="fnanchor">3573</a>).
Now, on Le Verrier’s theory, the 16th of May, 705, corresponded
with the 16th of April, 49 <small>B.C.</small> of the Julian calendar; but the
equinox occurred on the 24th of March. In order to dispose of
this difficulty, Le Verrier is obliged to have recourse to flagrant
special pleading: ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l’équinoxe,</span>’ he says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘était passé depuis 21 jours,<a id="FNanchor_3574" href="#Footnote_3574" class="fnanchor">3574</a>
et les troubles atmosphériques pouvaient durer encore. Était-ce
d’ailleurs autre chose qu’un prétexte pour Cicéron’?</span><a id="FNanchor_3575" href="#Footnote_3575" class="fnanchor">3575</a> A very thin
pretext, one would say,&mdash;a pretext which a man of Cicero’s intelligence
was hardly likely to resort to.<a id="FNanchor_3576" href="#Footnote_3576" class="fnanchor">3576</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_712">712</span></p>

<p>But this is not the only proof of the unsoundness of Le Verrier’s
theory. The argument which he bases upon Caesar’s words, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod
aequinoctium suberat</i>, shows that he completely misunderstands both
Caesar’s narrative and the letter of Cicero to which he appeals.
Cicero writes, ‘On the 24th of October I received letters from my
brother Quintus and from Caesar, dated from the nearest coasts of
Britain on the 25th<a id="FNanchor_3577" href="#Footnote_3577" class="fnanchor">3577</a> of September ... they were on the point of bringing
back the army’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a Quinto fratre et a Caesare accept a. d. IX Kal.
Nov. litteras, datas a litoribus Britanniae proximis a. d. VI Kal.
Octobr. ... exercitum</i> [<i>e</i>] <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Britannia reportabant</i><a id="FNanchor_3578" href="#Footnote_3578" class="fnanchor">3578</a>). The letters to which
Cicero refers were written, according to Napoleon and Le Verrier,
on the 21st of September of the Julian calendar; and, they triumphantly
remark, this tallies with Caesar’s statement, that he hurried
on his departure from Britain ‘because the equinox was at hand’.<a id="FNanchor_3579" href="#Footnote_3579" class="fnanchor">3579</a>
But there is one fact which they overlook. Caesar had a large
number of hostages and prisoners, and some of his ships had been
lost. He was therefore obliged to transport the hostages, prisoners,
and troops to Gaul in two successive trips. Only a few of the ships
which made the first trip ever returned to Britain, almost all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_713">713</span>
rest having been driven back to Gaul by adverse winds. Caesar
tells us that he waited for these ships ‘a considerable time (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliquamdiu</i>)
in vain’. Then, and not till then, he made the second trip,
being obliged to crowd the soldiers into the few ships that he had,
and not daring to wait any longer, ‘because the equinox was at
hand.’<a id="FNanchor_3580" href="#Footnote_3580" class="fnanchor">3580</a> The letters to which Cicero refers were evidently written
before the first trip; for neither Caesar nor Quintus had written
to Cicero for a long time;<a id="FNanchor_3581" href="#Footnote_3581" class="fnanchor">3581</a> and they would naturally have dispatched
their letters by one of the ships which made the first voyage. It is
clear, therefore, that the letters in question were written, not on the
21st of September of the reformed calendar, but ‘a considerable
time’ before that day. In fine, if Le Verrier and Napoleon were
right, the letters would have been written not from Britain but from
Gaul, and Cicero would have written not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reportabant</i> (‘they were on
the point of bringing back’) but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reportaverant</i> (‘they had brought
back’<a id="FNanchor_3582" href="#Footnote_3582" class="fnanchor">3582</a>).</p>

<p>Another fact, which Napoleon, Le Verrier, and Colonel Stoffel
appear to have overlooked, alone proves that not 67 days only but
90 days were intercalated in that year. The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nundinae</i> is
familiar to many readers of Cicero’s letters. To quote the authors
of the article <small>NUNDINAE</small> in Smith’s <cite>Dictionary of Greek and Roman
Antiquities</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_3583" href="#Footnote_3583" class="fnanchor">3583</a> ‘the Romans had a system of eight-day weeks, which,
like our seven-day weeks, ran on from one month to another and from
one year to another without breaking.’ Every eighth day was a
market-day, and was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nundinae</i>. Thus, if the 1st of January
was a market-day, the next was the 9th, the next the 17th, and so on.
We learn from Dion Cassius<a id="FNanchor_3584" href="#Footnote_3584" class="fnanchor">3584</a> that the Kalends of January, 702, was
a market-day; the same writer says that, in order to prevent the
Kalends of January, 714, from falling on a market-day&mdash;a coincidence
which was regarded as ill-omened&mdash;a day was intercalated extraordinarily
in 713;<a id="FNanchor_3585" href="#Footnote_3585" class="fnanchor">3585</a> and it follows that, if there had been no intercalation
in 713, the number of days that elapsed from the Kalends of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_714">714</span>
January, 702, to the last day of December, 713, would have been
a multiple of 8. Now, on the theory of Napoleon the Third, Le
Verrier, and Colonel Stoffel this number would have been 4,401; on
the theory that the year 708 contained 445 days, 4,424. The latter
number is divisible by 8; the former is not.</p>

<p>There has never been any question but that the number of days
intercalated in 708 was either 67 or 90; and the former number
has been proved to be wrong.</p>

<p>IV. In order to obtain an absolutely firm foundation for the
chronology of Caesar’s second expedition, one more question remains
to be answered. In this country it is generally taken for granted
that the Kalends of January, 709, the year in which Caesar’s reform
of the calendar came into operation, corresponded with the 1st of
January, 45 <small>B.C.</small> Various German scholars have, however, attempted
to prove that the Kalends of January, 709, fell on the 2nd of January
of the Julian calendar.</p>

<p>Let us first see what there is to be learned from the ancient writers.</p>

<p>Pliny<a id="FNanchor_3586" href="#Footnote_3586" class="fnanchor">3586</a> says that when the error in the execution of Caesar’s
reform was discovered, it was corrected by the omission of intercalary
days during twelve successive years.</p>

<p>Solinus<a id="FNanchor_3587" href="#Footnote_3587" class="fnanchor">3587</a> tells us that Caesar’s reform was vitiated by the pontiffs;
for, whereas it had been enjoined that a day should be intercalated
on the completion of the fourth year, they made the intercalation
at the beginning of the fourth year, not at the end. Thus, Solinus
continues, twelve days were intercalated in thirty-six years, whereas
only nine ought to have been intercalated.</p>

<p>Suetonius<a id="FNanchor_3588" href="#Footnote_3588" class="fnanchor">3588</a> says that the calendar, as reformed by Caesar, was
thrown into confusion by ‘negligence’, and rectified by Augustus;
also that Caesar made the calendar year consist of 365 days, so as
to bring it into harmony with the solar year, and, abolishing the
intercalary month, ordered that one day should be intercalated
every fourth year.<a id="FNanchor_3589" href="#Footnote_3589" class="fnanchor">3589</a></p>

<p>According to Censorinus,<a id="FNanchor_3590" href="#Footnote_3590" class="fnanchor">3590</a> Caesar directed that, in order to compensate
for the quarter of a day by which the solar exceeded the
calendar year, one day should be intercalated at the end of every
quadriennial cycle, after the Terminalia [that is to say, after the
23rd of February].
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_715">715</span></p>

<p>According to Macrobius,<a id="FNanchor_3591" href="#Footnote_3591" class="fnanchor">3591</a> Caesar directed that one day should be
intercalated every fourth year. Macrobius then makes substantially
the same charge against the pontiffs as Solinus, and goes on to say
that, after the error for which they were responsible had continued
for thirty-six years, Augustus corrected it by ordering that twelve
years should pass without any intercalation.</p>

<p>Now it is absolutely certain that of the first five years during which
the reformed calendar was in force, namely 709, 710, 711, 712, and
713, not one only but two contained an intercalary day.<a id="FNanchor_3592" href="#Footnote_3592" class="fnanchor">3592</a> For, as
we have already seen,<a id="FNanchor_3593" href="#Footnote_3593" class="fnanchor">3593</a> Dion Cassius<a id="FNanchor_3594" href="#Footnote_3594" class="fnanchor">3594</a> states that the Kalends of
January, 702, was a market-day, and also that, in order to prevent
the Kalends of January, 714, from falling on a market-day, a day
was intercalated extraordinarily (παρὰ τὰ καθεστηκότα<a id="FNanchor_3595" href="#Footnote_3595" class="fnanchor">3595</a>) in 713;<a id="FNanchor_3596" href="#Footnote_3596" class="fnanchor">3596</a>
and, as I had occasion to remark before, it follows that, if there
had been no intercalation in 713, the number of days that
elapsed from the Kalends of January, 702, to the last day of December,
713, would have been a multiple of 8. This would have been
the case if one of the four years 709, 710, 711, and 712 had contained
an intercalary day, but not otherwise.<a id="FNanchor_3597" href="#Footnote_3597" class="fnanchor">3597</a> Which was it?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_716">716</span></p>

<p>The year 711 may be set aside at once: nobody has ever argued
that it was a Leap Year; and no reason can be given to show that
it was.</p>

<p>1. Wilhelm Soltau,<a id="FNanchor_3598" href="#Footnote_3598" class="fnanchor">3598</a> the author of a valuable work on Roman
chronology, maintains that 709 was the first Leap Year of the reformed
calendar. He argues that Matzat’s theory, according to
which an intercalation occurred in 710, must be wrong, because it is
inconceivable that Caesar, who was then alive, should have allowed
an intercalation to take place in the second year of his calendar,
in defiance of his own edict, that the intercalation should be made
every fourth year (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quarto quoque anno intercalandum esse</i>). The
theory that the first intercalation was in 712 is, Soltau continues,
based only upon the statements, derived from the same source, of
Solinus and Macrobius. If, says Soltau, they are right, the Leap
Years, before Augustus rectified the error which had been made
in carrying out Caesar’s intentions, would have been 712, 715, 718,
721, 724, 727, 730, 733, 736, 739, 742, and 745. But Dion’s statement,
that 713 was an intercalary year, proves that this cannot
have been the case. The series must, therefore, have been 709, 713,
716, 719 ... 743. Soltau holds that the twelve years during which
intercalation was, by the order of Augustus, suspended, lasted from
745 to 756; that Augustus disapproved of Caesar’s (assumed)
anticipatory method of reckoning, that is to say, of his having
intercalated a day in the first year of his calendar instead of after
the conclusion of the fourth; that accordingly the next intercalation,
which would naturally have taken place in 757, was omitted; and
that the first intercalation after the reform of Augustus occurred in
761. Thus, like other writers<a id="FNanchor_3599" href="#Footnote_3599" class="fnanchor">3599</a> who differ from him on points of
detail, Soltau identifies the Kalends of January, 709, with the
2nd of January, 45 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>It will presently be shown that the statements of Macrobius and
Solinus do not <i>necessarily</i> lead to the conclusion which Soltau condemns.
Meanwhile I may remark that Soltau’s theory is irreconcilable
with the very passage in Dion Cassius to which he refers.<a id="FNanchor_3600" href="#Footnote_3600" class="fnanchor">3600</a>
Dion says that a day was intercalated <i>extraordinarily</i> (παρὰ τὰ
καθεστηκότα) in 713, in order to prevent New Year’s Day in 714
from falling on a market-day,<a id="FNanchor_3601" href="#Footnote_3601" class="fnanchor">3601</a> and that subsequently an intercalary
day was struck out.<a id="FNanchor_3602" href="#Footnote_3602" class="fnanchor">3602</a> It is therefore obvious that the intercalation
of 713 took place earlier than had been contemplated; and consequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_717">717</span>
that the previous intercalation must have occurred later
than 709; for if, as Soltau maintains, the previous intercalation
had taken place in 709, the intercalation of 713 took place at the
proper time. If, on the other hand, Dion’s words, παρὰ τὰ καθεστηκότα,
mean ‘contrary to the regulations erroneously attributed
to Caesar by the pontiffs’, that is to say, contrary to the triennial
cycle which they themselves followed, the intercalation, on Soltau’s
theory, took place a year too late; for, if the first intercalation had
occurred in 709, the object which Dion mentions could have been
attained by intercalating in 712.</p>

<p>2. Let us now examine the theory of Matzat,<a id="FNanchor_3603" href="#Footnote_3603" class="fnanchor">3603</a> namely, that the
first intercalation took place in 710. This writer believes that
Caesar’s reason for intercalating in 710 was to prevent the Kalends
of January in the following year from falling on a market-day.<a id="FNanchor_3604" href="#Footnote_3604" class="fnanchor">3604</a> He
holds that Dion’s words, παρὰ τὰ καθεστηκότα, mean ‘contrary
to the actual regulations of Caesar’; and accordingly he believes
that those regulations were at the time understood. He maintains,
however, that, after 713, the pontiffs intercalated every three years,&mdash;namely
in 716, 719, 722 ... 743; but he insists that they did this
simply for the same reason which had prompted the intercalation
in 713, namely to prevent the Kalends of January in each following
year from falling on a market-day. The statement of Dion, that, in
order to compensate for the day extraordinarily intercalated in 713,
another intercalary day was omitted, he takes to mean that the
next intercalation, which, on his theory, ought to have occurred in
714, was left out. Finally, he believes that the three superfluous
days which had accumulated during the twelve triennial cycles
were compensated for by the omission of all intercalations
in the years 745-756; and that the first intercalation under
the reform of Augustus occurred in 757. On this theory the
Kalends of January, 709, corresponded with the 1st of January,
45 B. C.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the objection which Soltau has brought
against Matzat’s theory;<a id="FNanchor_3605" href="#Footnote_3605" class="fnanchor">3605</a> but that objection is inconclusive. It
is not true that if Caesar had allowed an intercalation to take place
in 710, he would have done so ‘in defiance of his own edict, that the
intercalation should be made every fourth year (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quarto quoque anno
intercalaretur</i>)’. If, according to his scheme, the next intercalation
was to take place in 714, the next in 718, and so on, the intercalation
would still be made every fourth year. Provided it took place every
four years, what difference would it make whether it took place
first in 709, 710, 711, 712, or 713? Holzapfel<a id="FNanchor_3606" href="#Footnote_3606" class="fnanchor">3606</a> blames Matzat for
disregarding the testimony of Solinus and Macrobius. But Matzat
does not disregard their testimony: he simply refuses to admit
that they make any definite statement as to the year in which the <i>first</i>
intercalation of the Julian calendar occurred. The only statement
which would appear to support Holzapfel’s criticism is contained in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_718">718</span>
the words of Solinus, that, ‘whereas it had been enjoined that they
[the pontiffs] should intercalate one day in the fourth year, and
this ordinance ought to have been carried out on the completion of
the fourth year ... they intercalated at the beginning of the fourth
year, not at the end’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nam cum praeceptum esset, anno quarto ut
intercalarent unum diem, et oporteret confecto quarto anno id observari
... illi incipiente quarto intercalarunt, non desinente</i>). If by ‘the
beginning of the fourth year’ Solinus meant the fourth year of the
Julian calendar, that is to say, 712, and if he had original authority
for his statement, then Holzapfel is right. But observe the looseness
with which Solinus expresses himself. Immediately after saying
that the intercalation ought to have taken place ‘<i>in</i> the fourth year’,
he says that it ought to have taken place ‘on the completion of the
fourth year’. To state the facts correctly required extraordinary
precision and nicety of expression; and this requirement he failed
to satisfy. His meaning may have been that, in whatever year of
the Julian calendar the first intercalation took place, the next ought,
by Caesar’s ordinance, to have taken place four years later, and so
on. If it be objected that I have suggested an arbitrary interpretation
of his meaning, I reply that this interpretation is dictated by
the passage in which Dion Cassius states that the intercalation
of 713 was ‘contrary to the regulations’ (παρὰ τὰ καθεστηκότα).
Holzapfel<a id="FNanchor_3607" href="#Footnote_3607" class="fnanchor">3607</a> says that these words, <i>taken by themselves</i>, may mean
one of two things. They may mean that the intercalation of 713
was contrary to the actual regulations of Caesar; or they may mean
that it was contrary to the regulations adopted by the pontiffs in
misunderstanding or in contravention of Caesar’s regulations. The
question, says Holzapfel, can only be settled by other evidence;
and the only other evidence is that of Solinus and Macrobius, which
shows that the pontiffs misunderstood Caesar’s regulations. As
a matter of fact, their evidence does not show this, unless misunderstanding
is connoted by the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitium</i> and <i>error</i>. Matzat<a id="FNanchor_3608" href="#Footnote_3608" class="fnanchor">3608</a>
contends that such a misunderstanding would have been impossible,
for Caesar must have made his intentions clear. Holzapfel replies
that Caesar would no doubt have done so if he had foreseen his own
imminent death; but, as he certainly intended, in his capacity as
Pontifex Maximus, to superintend the execution of his own arrangements,
and thus establish the rule of intercalation which he contemplated,
the regulation <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut quarto quoque anno intercalaretur</i> might
seem sufficient. But Dion Cassius, if his testimony may be accepted,
settles the question. Immediately after saying that a day was
extraordinarily intercalated in 713, he adds that ‘of course an
intercalary day was in turn omitted, <i>in order that the calendar might
be brought into harmony with Caesar’s intentions</i>’ (καὶ δῆλον ὅτι [ἡμέρα
ἐμβόλιμος] ἀνθυφῃρέθη αὖθις, ὅπως ὁ χρόνος κατὰ τὰ τῷ Καίσαρι τῷ
προτέρῳ δόξαντα συμβῇ). Now these words, as Matzat<a id="FNanchor_3609" href="#Footnote_3609" class="fnanchor">3609</a> unanswerably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_719">719</span>
argues, prove that by παρὰ τὰ καθεστηκότα, Dion meant
‘contrary to the regulations’ actually made by Caesar.<a id="FNanchor_3610" href="#Footnote_3610" class="fnanchor">3610</a> Holzapfel,<a id="FNanchor_3611" href="#Footnote_3611" class="fnanchor">3611</a>
however, tries to explain away Dion’s remark by the argument that
the authority whom he followed may have been a contemporary
who shared the misconception of the pontiffs; and this I cannot
gainsay. Moreover, although I have argued that the words of
Solinus <i>may</i> be interpreted in a sense different from that which
Holzapfel ascribes to them, I admit that the conclusion which they
suggest is that Caesar intended to make his first intercalation in
713, and that the pontiffs made it in 712.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is expressly stated by Macrobius<a id="FNanchor_3612" href="#Footnote_3612" class="fnanchor">3612</a> that the Kalends
of January in the year of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepidianus tumultus</i> fell on a market-day;
and if, as Holzapfel maintains, this statement refers to the Lepidus
who, as one of the Triumvirs, revived Sulla’s policy of proscription
in 711, it proves that no intercalation occurred either in 710 or in
709.<a id="FNanchor_3613" href="#Footnote_3613" class="fnanchor">3613</a> Matzat, however, maintains that the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepidianus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_720">720</span>
tumultus</i> designate the outburst of Lepidus in 676 (78 B. C.).<a id="FNanchor_3614" href="#Footnote_3614" class="fnanchor">3614</a> Unger,<a id="FNanchor_3615" href="#Footnote_3615" class="fnanchor">3615</a>
who agrees with Holzapfel, maintains that the official recognition
of the superstitious dread with which the Roman populace contemplated
the coincidence of the Kalends of January with a market-day,
was due to the acts of Lepidus in 711. But, replies Matzat,<a id="FNanchor_3616" href="#Footnote_3616" class="fnanchor">3616</a> for
this ‘official recognition’ the approbation of the Pontifex Maximus
was necessary. Now in 713, as in 711, the Pontifex Maximus was
Lepidus himself; and, according to Macrobius, it was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepidianus
tumultus</i> which strengthened the popular belief that whenever the
Kalends of January fell upon a market-day, the whole year would
be darkened by ill-omened events. If, then, says Matzat, we are
to believe Unger, Lepidus described the deeds which he had himself
done in 711, and by which the joint supremacy of himself and the
other two Triumvirs had been established, as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tumultus</i>,&mdash;the most
horrible events of a year full of horrors! This argument is clever,
but I think that it is hardly fair. Lepidus was not obliged to
describe anything. Assuming that the Kalends of January, 711,
had fallen on a market-day, it is surely intelligible that he should
have recognized the wisdom of allaying superstitious fears, even
though they had been roused by his own acts, when he could do so
by the simple expedient of intercalating a day in 713. I agree with
Unger that there does not appear to have been anything very alarming
in the affair of 677, even though Lucan<a id="FNanchor_3617" href="#Footnote_3617" class="fnanchor">3617</a> describes it as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">truces
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_721">721</span>
Lepidi motus</i>; and, judging the question without bias on its own
merits, I can only conclude that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tumultus Lepidianus</i> was most
probably the outbreak of 711. If so, the first intercalary year of
the Julian calendar cannot have been either 709 or 710, but must
have been 712.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Holzapfel<a id="FNanchor_3618" href="#Footnote_3618" class="fnanchor">3618</a> points out that, if Matzat is right, the intercalary
cycle introduced by Augustus did not correspond with that
of Caesar. For after the reform of Augustus the intercalary years
were odd years, 761, 765, 769, and so on; while Caesar’s first intercalary
year is supposed by Matzat to have been 710. Or, if we
reckon the quadriennial cycles contemplated by Caesar from the
year 709, the intercalations, according to his regulation, would, on
Matzat’s theory, occur in the second, those made by Augustus in
the first year of each successive cycle.</p>

<p>All this is perfectly true: but what does it matter? The one
really important point, namely, that the intercalation should take
place every four years, was duly secured by Augustus. Whether it
took place in the first, the second, the third, or the fourth year of the
cycle, mattered not a jot. Holzapfel’s objection is purely academic.</p>

<p>Fourthly, says Holzapfel, if, as Matzat maintains, Caesar’s only
reason for intercalating in 710 was to prevent the Kalends of January
in the following year from falling on a market-day, it is difficult to
believe that Caesar should not have foreseen that for the same
reason it would be necessary to intercalate in 713, 716, and so on,
that is to say, every three years; in other words, that it would be
impossible to carry out the arrangement which he had himself made.<a id="FNanchor_3619" href="#Footnote_3619" class="fnanchor">3619</a></p>

<p>This is certainly a reasonable objection, and Matzat has not, so far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_722">722</span>
as I know, attempted to remove it: but it is perhaps conceivable
that a man so busy as Caesar should have failed to look far ahead.</p>

<p>Holzapfel<a id="FNanchor_3620" href="#Footnote_3620" class="fnanchor">3620</a> argues, further, that Matzat’s theory, according to
which the calendar, as reformed by Augustus, was inaugurated on
the 1st of January, 757 (<small>A.D.</small> 4), rests upon the assumption that
the first day of the intercalary cycle coincided with the first day of
the civil year, whereas it was really the day after the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terminalia</i>,
that is to say, the sixth day before the Kalends of March. This, he
maintains, is proved (<i>a</i>) by the place which Caesar gave to his
intercalary day; (<i>b</i>) by the fact that the two months intercalated
between November and December of 708 were called respectively
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensis intercalaris prior</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensis intercalaris posterior</i>, and also
by the fact that, according to Dion Cassius, the number of days
intercalated in that year was only 67, whereas the number of days
intercalated in <i>the civil year</i> 708 was 90; (<i>c</i>) by the fact that, according
to Macrobius and Solinus, Caesar ordained that the intercalary
day [which followed the 23rd of February] should be inserted at
the end of the fourth and before the fifth year of the Julian calendar.<a id="FNanchor_3621" href="#Footnote_3621" class="fnanchor">3621</a></p>

<p>Matzat<a id="FNanchor_3622" href="#Footnote_3622" class="fnanchor">3622</a> summarily replies to these arguments. Referring to
Macrobius,<a id="FNanchor_3623" href="#Footnote_3623" class="fnanchor">3623</a> he observes (<i>a</i>) that the place which Caesar gave to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_723">723</span>
intercalary day was identical with the place which the intercalary
day, whenever it occurred, had occupied before his reform; and
(<i>b</i>) that the two intercalary months known as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensis intercalaris
prior</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensis intercalaris posterior</i> were added to the year 708
in order that the calendar year 709 might begin on the Kalends of
January, and thus coincide with the consular year. If it be asked
why they were called <i>prior</i> and <i>posterior</i> although another intercalary
month had preceded them, the answer is easy: the other
month ought in any case to have been intercalated in that year,
whereas the <i>prior</i> and <i>posterior</i> were extraordinarily intercalated.
The passages in Macrobius and Solinus on which Holzapfel relies
have been already explained; and it has been shown that they do
not necessarily bear the meaning which he ascribes to them. One
fact alone appears to me to dispose of his contention, that the Julian
calendar did not come into operation until the sixth day before the
Kalends of March, 709: if it did not, why did January in that year
contain 31 days, whereas in every previous year it had contained
only 29?</p>

<p>Holzapfel also invokes the support of Böckh,<a id="FNanchor_3624" href="#Footnote_3624" class="fnanchor">3624</a> who remarked that
it would have been unnatural for a reformer to correct the error
caused by the difference of a quarter of a day between the civil
and the solar year until the error required correction. The conclusion
appears to Holzapfel inevitable that Caesar intended to make
his first intercalation as soon as, and not before, the error should
have amounted to one day, that is to say, in 713. Matzat,<a id="FNanchor_3625" href="#Footnote_3625" class="fnanchor">3625</a> on the
contrary, maintains that logically the proper place for the intercalary
day would have been immediately after the second year of
the quadriennial cycle. But he does not believe that Caesar cared
for such academic considerations. He undoubtedly fixed the place
of the intercalary day in the year not on astronomical grounds,
but according to usage. Why, then, asks Matzat, should it be
considered improbable that he fixed the place of the intercalary
year in the quadriennial cycle on the same principle?</p>

<p>3. Holzapfel<a id="FNanchor_3626" href="#Footnote_3626" class="fnanchor">3626</a> holds, as we have just seen, that the Caesarian
cycle began on the day after the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terminalia</i> of 709, that is to say,
on the sixth day before the Kalends of March; that Caesar intended
that the first intercalation should take place in 713; that the
pontiffs, misunderstanding his directions, made the first intercalation
at the beginning of the fourth year, that is to say, in 712;
that, as Dion says, a day was extraordinarily intercalated in 713;
that, to compensate for this extraordinary intercalation, a day was
omitted in 714, which accordingly comprised 364 days only; that
the pontiffs thenceforth intercalated every three years, namely in
715, 718, 721 ... 745; that, to compensate for the three superfluous
days which had been intercalated in consequence of the misunderstanding
of Caesar’s regulations, the intercalations which ought to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_724">724</span>
have occurred in 749, 753, and 757, were omitted; and that the
first intercalation after the reform of Augustus took place in 761.</p>

<p>This theory, as the reader will have already seen, cannot stand
unless the evidence of Dion Cassius is to be rejected. Indeed it
cannot stand even then. Holzapfel is not justified in assuming that
in order to compensate for the extraordinary intercalation of 713,
a day was omitted in 714; for, on his own theory, 714 was an
ordinary year. Matzat<a id="FNanchor_3627" href="#Footnote_3627" class="fnanchor">3627</a> points out that, in the passage in which
Dion<a id="FNanchor_3628" href="#Footnote_3628" class="fnanchor">3628</a> describes the omission of a day to compensate for the extraordinary
intercalation&mdash;καὶ δῆλον ὅτι ἀνθυφῃρέθη αὖθις, ὅπως ὁ χρόνος
κατὰ τὰ τῷ Καίσαρι τῷ προτέρῳ δόξαντα συμβῇ&mdash;the words ἡμέρα
ἐμβόλιμος (an intercalary day) must necessarily be supplied, as
the subject of the verb ἀνθυφῃρέθη, from the preceding sentence.
Holzapfel retorts that his view does not involve the assumption
of a change of subject. ‘One can very well translate,’
he says, ‘“an intercalary day was inserted, and self-evidently in
turn omitted”’ (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Man kann sehr wohl übersetzen: ‘es wurde ein
Schalttag eingelegt und selbstverständlich wiederum in Abzug
gebracht’</span><a id="FNanchor_3629" href="#Footnote_3629" class="fnanchor">3629</a>). This is not a satisfactory answer; for, on Holzapfel’s
own showing, the omitted day was <i>not</i> an intercalary day. There
is no evidence that a day was ever withdrawn from an ordinary
year in the Roman calendar; and, as Matzat<a id="FNanchor_3630" href="#Footnote_3630" class="fnanchor">3630</a> points out, the best
proof that such a proceeding would have been regarded as out of
the question is supplied by the procedure of Augustus. Instead of
correcting the error of the pontiffs by withdrawing three days from
one ordinary year, he omitted three intercalary days in three intercalary
years, thus taking twelve years to accomplish a reform which,
according to modern notions, might have been accomplished in one.
If Dion’s words are interpreted in their natural sense, they evidently
mean that the next intercalary day which would have occurred,
according to Caesar’s regulations, was omitted. Thenceforth,
accordingly, if the first intercalation occurred in 710, the intercalary
years were 716, 719, 722 ... 743. Or if, as Holzapfel insists, Dion’s
words, παρὰ τὰ καθεστηκότα, mean ‘contrary to the regulations
as erroneously interpreted by the pontiffs’, and if, as he also insists,
the year in which they first intercalated was 712, then the next
year in which they would naturally have intercalated was 715:
the extraordinary intercalation of 713 must have been compensated
for by the omission of an intercalary day in 715; and the following
series of intercalary years must have been 718, 721, 724 ... 745.</p>

<p>Again, Holzapfel’s theory compels him to disregard silently the
testimony of Solinus, on whose authority he lays such stress. Solinus<a id="FNanchor_3631" href="#Footnote_3631" class="fnanchor">3631</a>
says that twelve days were intercalated in the first thirty-six years
of the Julian calendar: according to Holzapfel, thirteen were
intercalated.</p>

<p>Lastly, if we accept Holzapfel’s view, that the first day of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_725">725</span>
Julian calendar was the sixth day before the Kalends of March, 709,
we find that a day <i>was</i> intercalated immediately after the end of
the fourth year of the cycle, namely, after the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terminalia</i> of 713.
But Holzapfel assures us that, according to Macrobius and Solinus,
this was not the case.</p>

<p>But I am not arguing against Holzapfel’s theory as regards the
first intercalary year of the Julian calendar; and what appears to
tell most strongly in favour of it, besides the probability that the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepidianus tumultus</i> occurred in 711,<a id="FNanchor_3632" href="#Footnote_3632" class="fnanchor">3632</a> is the statement of Macrobius,<a id="FNanchor_3633" href="#Footnote_3633" class="fnanchor">3633</a>
that Augustus enacted that the intercalation should take place
‘every fifth year’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quinto quoque anno</i>), that is to say, according to
our reckoning, every four years. These words seem to imply that
the pontiffs had actually misunderstood Caesar’s regulation. On
Matzat’s theory, however, the pontiffs who intercalated παρὰ
τὰ καθεστηκότα in 713 deliberately set that regulation aside in order
to avoid the dreaded coincidence of the Kalends of January with
a market-day. But, says Matzat, every three years this troublesome
necessity recurred; and thus ultimately, as he suggests, the
erroneous view might prevail that Caesar had himself intended to
intercalate every three years ([anno] <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quarto non peracto sed incipiente</i><a id="FNanchor_3634" href="#Footnote_3634" class="fnanchor">3634</a>).
But what right have we to assume that after 713 the pontiffs
took any account of the nundinal superstition? At all events,
if Holzapfel is right in maintaining that the first intercalary year
of the reformed calendar was 712, there can be no doubt that the
subsequent intercalary years were 713, 718 ... 745; and it is therefore
impossible for him to reconcile his view, that the first intercalation
under the reform of Augustus occurred in 761, with the statement
that Augustus allowed twelve years to pass without any
intercalation. Augustus’s first intercalation undoubtedly took place
in 757; for in that year, if Caesar’s regulation had been observed,
the twelfth intercalation would have occurred.</p>

<p>Opinions may differ as to whether Matzat’s theory or the modification
of Holzapfel’s which I have just suggested is the more probable.
As, according to the latter, the series of intercalary years must
have been 712, 713, 718, 721, 724, 727, 730, 733, 736, 739, 742, 745,
it implies that after 713 the pontiffs thought it safe to disregard the
nundinal superstition. So far my suggestion may be objectionable.
On the other hand, it fits in with all the statements of the ancient
writers, except that one remark of Dion Cassius which, as Holzapfel
suggests, he may have made on erroneous information;<a id="FNanchor_3635" href="#Footnote_3635" class="fnanchor">3635</a> and
particularly it fits in, as no other series which has been suggested
does, with the statements that twelve days were intercalated in the
first thirty-six years of the Julian calendar,<a id="FNanchor_3636" href="#Footnote_3636" class="fnanchor">3636</a> and that Augustus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_726">726</span>
allowed the next twelve years to pass without any intercalation.
However, the difference between Matzat’s theory and mine (which
is purely tentative) is unimportant; for they agree in the main
point,&mdash;that the Kalends of January, 709, corresponded with the
1st of January, 45 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>V. We have now gained the knowledge which will enable us to
investigate the chronology of Caesar’s second invasion of Britain.
We have ascertained that the Kalends of January, 709, fell on the
1st of January, 45 <small>B.C.</small>; that 90 days were intercalated in 708,
which accordingly consisted of 445 days; that a month of 23 days
was intercalated in 702, which accordingly comprised 378 days;
and that 701, 703, 704, 705, 706, and 707 were ordinary years, each
comprising 355 days. It follows that the last day of 700, the year
in which Caesar made his second expedition to Britain, corresponded
with the 30th of November, 54 <small>B.C.</small>, and that the sixth day before
the Kalends of October, the day on which he wrote to tell Cicero
that he was on the point of bringing back his army from Britain
to Gaul, corresponded with the 29th of August. From these data
it will be easy to ascertain the correspondence of any date in the
year 700 which we find in our authorities with the Julian calendar.</p>

<p>After quitting Cisalpine Gaul, Caesar returned to his army, which
had wintered in the country of the Belgae. He made a tour of
inspection, visiting the various camps, which were of course in the
immediate neighbourhood of the yards where the legionaries had
been building the ships for his intended expedition, that is to say,
at the Portus Itius (Boulogne), and probably on the estuaries of the
Canche, the Authie, the Somme, and the Seine.<a id="FNanchor_3637" href="#Footnote_3637" class="fnanchor">3637</a> After ordering all
the ships to assemble at the Portus Itius, he started with four
legions in light marching order and 800 cavalry for the country of
the Treveri, which, roughly speaking, comprised the greater part
of the province of Luxembourg, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg,
and the southern part of Rhenish Prussia.<a id="FNanchor_3638" href="#Footnote_3638" class="fnanchor">3638</a> Two chiefs of this
people, named Cingetorix and Indutiomarus, were struggling for
supremacy. Cingetorix at once presented himself before Caesar, and
promised fidelity. Indutiomarus collected levies, and prepared to
fight. Many of the leading men, however, came into Caesar’s camp
and made terms for themselves. Indutiomarus found that he had
miscalculated his strength, and hastened to excuse himself. Caesar,
who had no time to spare, contented himself with taking hostages
for his good behaviour and returned to the Portus Itius. About
25 days after his arrival, having meantime been detained by contrary
winds, he sailed for Britain.<a id="FNanchor_3639" href="#Footnote_3639" class="fnanchor">3639</a></p>

<p>The exact date of Caesar’s departure from Cisalpine Gaul is
uncertain. On the 2nd of June, that is to say, the 9th of May of
the Julian calendar, Cicero received at Rome a letter from his
brother, written at Placentia;<a id="FNanchor_3640" href="#Footnote_3640" class="fnanchor">3640</a> and on the following day he received
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_727">727</span>
another letter from his brother, written at Blandeno, a town
near Placentia, the exact site of which is not known,<a id="FNanchor_3641" href="#Footnote_3641" class="fnanchor">3641</a> and also a
letter from Caesar, written apparently at the same place.<a id="FNanchor_3642" href="#Footnote_3642" class="fnanchor">3642</a> Napoleon,
erroneously maintaining that the second and the third of these
letters were received by Cicero on the 5th, instead of the 3rd, of
June, and assuming (‘pour trouver le temps voulu’, as he naïvely
remarks) that, in consequence of accidental delays, they took 13
days to reach Rome, concludes that Caesar quitted Blandeno on the
23rd of May, which he identifies with the 22nd<a id="FNanchor_3643" href="#Footnote_3643" class="fnanchor">3643</a> of the same month,
but which really corresponded with the 29th of April of the Julian
calendar. T. Bergk, on the contrary, maintains that if there had
been any delay in the transmission of the letters, Cicero would have
mentioned it in his reply; and he supposes that Caesar and Quintus
Cicero started on their journey for Transalpine Gaul on the 2nd of
June, that is to say, on the 9th of May of the Julian calendar.<a id="FNanchor_3644" href="#Footnote_3644" class="fnanchor">3644</a> All
that can be safely said is that, if the letter-carrier travelled at the
usual rate, namely between 40 and 50 Roman miles a day,<a id="FNanchor_3645" href="#Footnote_3645" class="fnanchor">3645</a> the two
letters were written about the 30th of April or the 1st of May of the
Julian calendar; and therefore we have no right to assume that
Caesar quitted Blandeno before the former day.</p>

<p>It is possible, as we shall presently see, to fix the date of Caesar’s
arrival at the Portus Itius and of his voyage to Britain within a day
or two; but it is plainly impossible to make any satisfactory calculation
of the dates of his movements from the time when he left
Blandeno to the time when he left the country of the Treveri and
marched for the Portus Itius; and the minute computations of
Napoleon and others are simply elaborate trifling.<a id="FNanchor_3646" href="#Footnote_3646" class="fnanchor">3646</a> For, although
Caesar’s <i>average</i> rate of travelling may be estimated approximately,
we do not know how far he penetrated into the extensive country
of the Treveri; and it is waste of time to guess how long he stayed
there. This much only can be said with certainty:&mdash;he did not
let the grass grow under his feet.<a id="FNanchor_3647" href="#Footnote_3647" class="fnanchor">3647</a> For he left Blandeno about the
30th of April: he arrived, as we shall presently see,<a id="FNanchor_3648" href="#Footnote_3648" class="fnanchor">3648</a> finally at the
Portus Itius about the 11th of June; and in those 43 days he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_728">728</span>
travelled from Blandeno across the Alps and across Gaul to the
English Channel; moved along the coast to various points between
Boulogne and the mouth of the Seine; and marched from Boulogne
to the neighbourhood of Sedan, or further&mdash;at least 180 miles&mdash;and
back again.</p>

<p>On the 27th of July, that is to say, on the 2nd of July of the
Julian calendar, Cicero wrote to Atticus, ‘Judging from my brother
Quintus’s letters, I imagine that by this time he is in Britain’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex
Q. fratris litteris suspicor iam eum esse in Britannia</i><a id="FNanchor_3649" href="#Footnote_3649" class="fnanchor">3649</a>). It would be
very rash, however, to infer from this that Caesar landed in Britain
before, or even as early as, the 2nd of July; for, as we have seen,
his embarkation was delayed by the long continuance of adverse
winds. The first letter which announced the arrival of the expeditionary
force in Britain was referred to by Cicero in a letter to
Quintus, in which he says, ‘How I rejoiced at your letter from
Britain! I was nervous about the sea and the coast of that island’
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">O iucundas mihi tuas de Britannia literas! Timebam Oceanum,
timebam litus insulae</i><a id="FNanchor_3650" href="#Footnote_3650" class="fnanchor">3650</a>). This letter is undated; but it must have
been written some time after the one which Cicero wrote to Atticus
on the 27th of July; for in the letter to Atticus we find the words,
‘I have undertaken to defend Messius.... After that I have to
prepare myself for Drusus, and then for Scaurus’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Messius defendebatur
a nobis ... Deinde me expedio ad Drusum, inde ad Scaurum</i><a id="FNanchor_3651" href="#Footnote_3651" class="fnanchor">3651</a>);
while in the letter to Quintus Cicero wrote, ‘The day I write this
Drusus has been acquitted.... The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia</i> have been put off to
September. Scaurus’s trial will take place immediately’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quo die
haec scripsi, Drusus erat ... absolutus ... Comitia in mensem Septembrem
reiecta sunt. Scauri indicium statim exercebitur</i><a id="FNanchor_3652" href="#Footnote_3652" class="fnanchor">3652</a>). Asconius<a id="FNanchor_3653" href="#Footnote_3653" class="fnanchor">3653</a>
tells us that the last day of Scaurus’s trial was the 2nd of September;
and Cicero’s remark that ‘the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia</i> have been put off to September’
makes it evident that he wrote in August; while from his
saying that ‘Scaurus’s trial will take place immediately’ we should
naturally infer that when he wrote the 2nd of September was not far
off. Letters from Britain generally reached Rome in about 27 days;<a id="FNanchor_3654" href="#Footnote_3654" class="fnanchor">3654</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_729">729</span>
and accordingly we may conclude that the letter in which Quintus
Cicero announced his arrival in Britain was written about the end
of July; that is to say, about the 6th of July of the Julian calendar.<a id="FNanchor_3655" href="#Footnote_3655" class="fnanchor">3655</a>
Now Caesar says that the tide [in the Straits of Dover] turned
westward soon after daybreak on the morning of his arrival in
Britain;<a id="FNanchor_3656" href="#Footnote_3656" class="fnanchor">3656</a> and this statement proves that he landed either <i>about</i>
the time of full moon or <i>about</i> the time of new moon. There was
a full moon on the 21st of July, 54 <small>B.C.</small>; and the previous new moon
occurred on the 7th of July. Napoleon<a id="FNanchor_3657" href="#Footnote_3657" class="fnanchor">3657</a> insists that the landing
must have taken place on the day of full moon, arguing that without
moonlight Caesar could not have undertaken the march which he
made on the night following his arrival. But, as we have already
seen, Napoleon argues on the erroneous assumption that Caesar
intercalated only 67 days in the year 708, and accordingly he fixes
all the dates of the unreformed calendar which occur in Cicero’s
letters of 700 twenty-three days too late. His argument that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_730">730</span>
Caesar could not have made a night march except by the light of
the moon is worthless. It must be remembered that, in the first
half of July, there is no real night over any part of the British Isles;
and no one familiar with the records of night marches would deny
that Caesar could have marched on a clear night at that time of the
year. Long<a id="FNanchor_3658" href="#Footnote_3658" class="fnanchor">3658</a> says that ‘of course he had also the moon on the night
on which he sailed from the Gallic coast’. There is no ‘of course’ in
the matter. Caesar sailed from Gaul to Britain in 55 <small>B.C.</small> after midnight,
on the 26th or 27th of August, that is to say either five or four
days before the full moon;<a id="FNanchor_3659" href="#Footnote_3659" class="fnanchor">3659</a> and the moon set soon after midnight
both of August 25-26 and of August 26-27. Moreover, according to
Napoleon himself, Caesar sailed from Britain to Gaul in 55 <small>B.C.</small> on
the 12th of September,<a id="FNanchor_3660" href="#Footnote_3660" class="fnanchor">3660</a> that is to say, on a moonless night: as
new moon occurred on the 14th, and he did not sail until after
midnight, he could not have had the benefit of moonlight unless he
had deferred his voyage until the date of the equinox; and I am
assured by Captain Iron, the harbour-master of Dover, that on a
fine night, especially in July, there would not have been the least
difficulty in sailing without a moon. As a matter of fact, William
the Conqueror sailed to England on a dark night. ‘The moon,’
says Mr Freeman,<a id="FNanchor_3661" href="#Footnote_3661" class="fnanchor">3661</a> ‘was hidden and the heavens were clouded over.
The Duke therefore ordered every ship to bear a light.... The
ships were to keep as near together as might be, and to follow
closely after the beacon-light of his own ship.’ If, then, we decide
that Caesar landed in Britain on the day of new moon, the 7th of
July, 54 <small>B.C.</small>, we shall not be more than one day wrong; but to fix
the date with absolute precision is impossible.<a id="FNanchor_3662" href="#Footnote_3662" class="fnanchor">3662</a></p>

<p>As Caesar landed about the 7th of July, it follows that he had
reached the Portus Itius, where he was delayed about 25 days,
about the 11th of June.</p>

<p>On the day after he landed Caesar encountered a British force
12 miles from his camp on the coast. On the following day, while
his troops were pursuing the fugitives, he was recalled to the coast
by the news that a large number of his ships had been damaged
by a storm. He then proceeded to construct a naval camp, and,
as soon as it was finished, returned to the point from which he
had started.<a id="FNanchor_3663" href="#Footnote_3663" class="fnanchor">3663</a> As the construction of the camp occupied ‘about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_731">731</span>
ten days’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circiter dies X</i>), we shall not be far wrong if we say that
it was finished 12 days after the landing, that is to say, about the
19th of July of the Julian calendar.</p>

<p>We now come to a date the significance of which has hardly been
appreciated. At the close of one of his letters to Quintus, Cicero
writes, ‘Caesar wrote me a letter from Britain on the 1st of September...
in which, to prevent my wondering at not getting one
from you, he tells me that you were not with him when he reached
the coast’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex Britannia Caesar ad me K. Septembr. dedit litteras
... quibus, ne admirer, quod a te nullas acceperim, scribit se sine te
fuisse, cum ad mare accesserit</i><a id="FNanchor_3664" href="#Footnote_3664" class="fnanchor">3664</a>). This passage proves that Caesar
had returned from the interior of Britain to the coast on or before
the 1st of September, that is to say, the 5th of August of the Julian
calendar. But we have already seen that he did not quit the coast
after the construction of his naval camp until about the 19th of
July, and that on the 29th of August he was still in Britain, ‘on
the point of bringing back the army,’ and did not sail for Gaul till
several days later.<a id="FNanchor_3665" href="#Footnote_3665" class="fnanchor">3665</a> We have to decide, then, between two alternatives.
Either Caesar had finished the campaign against Cassivellaunus
by the 5th of August of the Julian calendar, and thereafter
remained on the coast until the 29th of August, when he was able
to announce that he was ‘on the point of bringing back the army’;
or he made a hurried temporary visit to the coast, the object of
which remains unexplained. The latter view is not supported by
the <cite>Commentaries</cite>. Caesar’s narrative certainly leaves the impression
that, immediately after the completion of his naval camp,
he resumed the military operations which had been interrupted by
the shipwreck, and did not again return to the coast until the time
came for him to prepare for his voyage to Gaul. He tells us that
Cassivellaunus, after the failure of the attack which had been made
by his orders upon the naval camp, and in consequence of the
reverses which he had suffered, sued for peace; that he ordered
Cassivellaunus to furnish hostages;<a id="FNanchor_3666" href="#Footnote_3666" class="fnanchor">3666</a> and that, ‘on receiving the
hostages, he led back the army to the sea, where he found the ships
repaired’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Obsidibus acceptis exercitum reducit ad mare, naves invenit
refectas</i><a id="FNanchor_3667" href="#Footnote_3667" class="fnanchor">3667</a>). ‘When they were launched,’ he continues, ‘he determined
to take the army back in two trips’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">his deductis ... duobus
commeatibus exercitum reportare instituit</i><a id="FNanchor_3668" href="#Footnote_3668" class="fnanchor">3668</a>). Certainly there is not
a word in this to support the view, which is advocated by Vogel,
that the visit to the coast which Caesar made on the 1st of September
(the 5th of August of the Julian calendar) was purely temporary,
and took place <i>before</i> he began to march towards the country of
Cassivellaunus; and the motive which Vogel<a id="FNanchor_3669" href="#Footnote_3669" class="fnanchor">3669</a> suggests for the
visit&mdash;that Caesar wished to inspect the camp once more and to
give the necessary instructions before marching against Cassivellaunus&mdash;is
hardly adequate, unless we grant Vogel’s assumption,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_732">732</span>
that when Caesar returned to the sea the campaign had advanced
no further than the stage which he describes in the 17th chapter of
his Fifth Book, where three legions under Trebonius inflicted a
decisive defeat on the enemy; in other words, that Caesar returned
from a point within a day’s march of the sea. But this affair, according
to the <cite>Commentaries</cite>, took place on the very day after
Caesar quitted his naval camp in order to resume the campaign;
whereas he returned to the sea, on Vogel’s own showing, about
17 days after he quitted the camp. If, on the other hand, we adopt
Napoleon’s view<a id="FNanchor_3670" href="#Footnote_3670" class="fnanchor">3670</a>&mdash;that Caesar, after he returned to the sea on
the 1st of September, remained there until he sailed for Gaul&mdash;how
are we to account for the 24 days which elapsed before he wrote to
tell Cicero that he was on the point of bringing back the army?
What was he doing all that time? Napoleon,<a id="FNanchor_3671" href="#Footnote_3671" class="fnanchor">3671</a> indeed, maintains
that, on the day on which he wrote this last letter, he actually
sailed for Gaul, and Bergk that he had already arrived in Gaul;
but it has already been shown that both these assumptions are
untenable. Moreover, in order to account for Caesar’s having
arrived at the sea so early, Napoleon and Bergk are forced to strain
the words of the <cite>Commentaries</cite> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exercitum reducit ad mare</i>),&mdash;to
assume that Caesar hurried on in advance of his army, and that it
did not reach the coast until several days later.<a id="FNanchor_3672" href="#Footnote_3672" class="fnanchor">3672</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_733">733</span></p>

<p>Although the problem cannot be definitively solved, I have no
doubt but that Vogel’s solution is wrong. Not only does it give
the lie to Caesar’s narrative, but it requires us to believe that Caesar
had failed for about 17 days to make any headway against the
Britons, and had been held in check by them within a dozen miles
of the sea. Yet Caesar states that, in consequence of the defeat
which Cassivellaunus suffered at the hands of Trebonius on the
day after he left the newly-constructed naval camp, the British
infantry levies dispersed; and in the same breath he goes on to say
that he forthwith marched for the country of Cassivellaunus.<a id="FNanchor_3673" href="#Footnote_3673" class="fnanchor">3673</a> If,
as Vogel implies, this statement had been false, surely Quintus
Cicero would have informed his brother, in one of the five letters
which he wrote before the 1st of September, of the real state of
affairs! On the other hand, I find it difficult to believe that Caesar
used the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exercitum reducit ad mare</i> loosely, and that he remained
on the coast from the 1st to the 25th of September, without
once writing to Cicero between those two dates,<a id="FNanchor_3674" href="#Footnote_3674" class="fnanchor">3674</a> and then remained
several days longer before embarking. This view, indeed, would
compel us to assume that he left Trebonius or one of his other
generals to carry on the negotiations with Cassivellaunus which are
described in the 22nd chapter of his Fifth Book.</p>

<p>Napoleon, it is true, believes that Caesar did not leave his army
and hurry on in advance of it to his naval camp until the negotiations
were completed and he had received his hostages from Cassivellaunus.<a id="FNanchor_3675" href="#Footnote_3675" class="fnanchor">3675</a>
But on this assumption what motive could he have had,
first, for hurrying on in advance of his army, and, secondly, for
delaying its re-embarkation until after the lapse of several weeks?
I am inclined, therefore, to believe that he made a hurried temporary
visit to his naval camp, escorted probably by a small column,
and then, having accomplished his purpose, returned to the main
army in order to conduct or to complete the negotiations with
Cassivellaunus. The motive of his visit may have been connected
with the attack which the Kentish chieftains made upon the naval
camp.<a id="FNanchor_3676" href="#Footnote_3676" class="fnanchor">3676</a></p>

<p>The date of Caesar’s return to Gaul can only be given approximately.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_734">734</span>
We have seen that on the 25th of September (the 29th of
August of the Julian calendar) he wrote to Cicero, saying that he was
on the point of bringing back the army.<a id="FNanchor_3677" href="#Footnote_3677" class="fnanchor">3677</a> Vogel<a id="FNanchor_3678" href="#Footnote_3678" class="fnanchor">3678</a>, remarking that,
after he reached the coast, his ships had to be launched and loaded,
and that he did not sail with the second detachment of troops until
he had waited a long time in vain for the return of the ships which
had carried the first, concludes that he did not return to Gaul until
about 20 days after he wrote to Cicero, that is to say, not until the
15th of October. This date corresponds with the 17th of September
of the Julian calendar; and Vogel maintains that it agrees with
Caesar’s statement of the reason which led him to hurry on his
return, namely, that the equinox was at hand. But it is impossible
to estimate, from Caesar’s statement, how many days he waited
for the return of his ships. Let us examine the attempts which have
been made to gain a clue from Cicero’s correspondence.</p>

<p>Vogel<a id="FNanchor_3679" href="#Footnote_3679" class="fnanchor">3679</a> points out that Cicero,<a id="FNanchor_3680" href="#Footnote_3680" class="fnanchor">3680</a> in a letter written just after the
23rd of November&mdash;the 26th of October of the Julian calendar&mdash;referred
to two letters which he had received from Quintus, and
also to a third, which Quintus had handed to Labienus for transmission
the day before he dispatched the earlier of the other two,
but which had not yet arrived. Now Labienus had remained in
Gaul during the invasion of Britain.<a id="FNanchor_3681" href="#Footnote_3681" class="fnanchor">3681</a> It is clear, therefore, that
these three letters were not written until after Quintus had returned
to Gaul. On the other hand, they would seem to have been the
first letters which Quintus wrote to his brother after his return.
For Cicero, in the letter in which he referred to them, said, ‘where
your Nervii dwell and how far off, I have no idea’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ubi enim isti
sint Nervii et quam longe absint, nescio</i><a id="FNanchor_3682" href="#Footnote_3682" class="fnanchor">3682</a>). The Nervii were the tribe
in whose country Quintus, with his legion, was to pass the winter.<a id="FNanchor_3683" href="#Footnote_3683" class="fnanchor">3683</a>
Evidently Quintus, when he wrote the two letters which Cicero
received, had not yet reached the country of the Nervii; for otherwise
he could not, on the previous day, have been with Labienus,
who was to winter in the country of another tribe. Probably, as
Vogel concludes, he wrote from Samarobriva, or Amiens, where
Caesar had his head quarters and where the arrangements for the
distribution of the legions were made.<a id="FNanchor_3684" href="#Footnote_3684" class="fnanchor">3684</a> Again, in the letter which
has been already quoted, Cicero wrote to Quintus, ‘Pray be careful
to let me know to whom I am to give the letter which I shall then
send you,&mdash;to Caesar’s letter-carriers, for him to forward it direct
to you, or to those of Labienus?’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tu velim cures ut sciam quibus
nos dare oporteat eas quas ad te deinde litteras mittemus, Caesarisne
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_735">735</span>
tabellariis, ut is ad te protinus mittat, an Labieni</i><a id="FNanchor_3685" href="#Footnote_3685" class="fnanchor">3685</a>). Vogel remarks
that ‘this question is only intelligible on the hypothesis that Quintus
was only just beginning to take up his quarters in Gaul’ at the
time when he wrote the two letters which Cicero had just received.
Now a letter would have required about 25 days for transmission
from Samarobriva to Rome;<a id="FNanchor_3686" href="#Footnote_3686" class="fnanchor">3686</a> and accordingly the letters to which
Cicero referred, assuming that he replied to them promptly, would
have been written about the end of October. Vogel, who thinks
that they must have been written within a fortnight after Quintus
and Caesar returned to Gaul, infers that they cannot have returned
earlier than the 15th of October, the 17th of September of the Julian
calendar. His reasoning is ingenious; but unfortunately we do not
know exactly how soon after the receipt of his brother’s second letter
Cicero wrote, or how many days intervened between the arrival of
the first and of the second.</p>

<p>On the whole, it appears to me that all we can say for certain
regarding the date of Caesar’s return is this. It cannot be fixed earlier
than several days after the 29th of August of the Julian calendar,&mdash;the
date of the letter in which he informed Cicero that he was on the
point of bringing back the army. Bearing in mind that it occurred
when ‘the equinox was at hand’, we may place it about the middle
of September.</p>

<h2 id="PII_Pg735">TOPOGRAPHICAL NOTES</h2>

<p>On April 25, 1902, I observed more carefully than I had ever
done before the coast between Sandgate and West Hythe. To
speak of the hills between Sandgate and Hythe as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angusti montes</i>
is sheer nonsense. Caesar would never have attempted to force
a passage inland at any point between Lympne and Sandgate;<a id="FNanchor_3687" href="#Footnote_3687" class="fnanchor">3687</a>
nor would the Britons have abandoned these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loca superiora</i>, which
lay ready to hand. There are, indeed, depressions in the line of
hills&mdash;(1) just west of Sandgate railway station, (2) nearly opposite
the Seabrook (now Imperial) Hotel, and (3) west of Hythe, just
west of the point where the road diverges from the military canal;
but if Caesar had attempted to force these gaps, he would have
found himself entangled in the hills behind. 27.4.02.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Quite recently I explored the easternmost and the westernmost
of the three valleys which partially break the continuity of the hills
behind Hythe. Neither would have been [reasonably] practicable
for an invading army [in the conditions of ancient warfare]. The
road leading through the former, which branches off from the road
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_736">736</span>
[running from Sandgate] to Hythe, is level for the first 120 yards,
and then ascends rapidly for a short distance. Then it is tolerably
level until about 100 yards before one gets to the cross-road which
turns off to the left, when it ascends rapidly for a long way. A
column moving along it would have been exposed to attack from the
hills on either side, and particularly on the west. 3.9.03.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the return voyage from Boulogne [September 5, 1903] I most
carefully scrutinized the whole coast-line between Sandgate and
the Foreland, as I had often done before on land. Caesar’s description
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angusti montes</i> is applicable only to Shakespeare’s Cliff
and the cliffs which extend from the Castle Hill to the neighbourhood
of Kingsdown. It is not applicable even to the imposing heights
which bound East Wear Bay, because, although they might fairly
be called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angusti montes</i>, the missiles of which Caesar speaks could
only have been thrown on to the beach from the precipitous but
low chalk cliffs which form the lowest part of these heights; whereas
he plainly means that the missiles would [or rather, could] have
been thrown by the enemy who were standing <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in omnibus collibus</i>;
and if he anchored off East Wear Bay, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">colles</i> were a quarter of
a mile or more from the sea. The low chalk cliffs of East Wear
Bay would never have been called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">montes</i>, although they are the
lowest part of a range of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">montes</i>. The notion that the cliffs between
East Wear Bay and Folkestone Harbour, or the cliffs on which the
‘Leas’ stand, as seen from a vessel half a mile from the shore,
would have been called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angusti montes</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">montes</i> at all is simply
ludicrous. No! It is absolutely certain that Caesar’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angusti montes</i>
were the cliffs of Dover,&mdash;the cliffs between [and including] the
Castle Hill and the Foreland. And as for Airy’s theory, how could
cliffs ‘ten to thirty feet high’ have been called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angusti montes</i> by an
observer standing on the deck of a ship five nautical miles away?<a id="FNanchor_3688" href="#Footnote_3688" class="fnanchor">3688</a></p>

<p>[Cicero’s description (<i>Att.</i>, iv, 16, § 7) of the cliffs which ‘walled
in the approaches to the island’&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mirificis molibus</i>&mdash;is applicable
only to the heights behind East Wear Bay and the cliffs of Dover.]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following notes were jotted down on September 15, 1902,
on the deck of a steamer running from Dover to Deal:&mdash;</p>

<p>Six <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">colles</i> at present visible off Dover Harbour, i.e. on east of old
[pre-Roman and Roman] harbour: one on left, not counting Shakespeare’s
Cliff.</p>

<p>Eight from off the Foreland. Nothing could be more appropriate
than the expressions <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in omnibus collibus expositas</i> [hostium
copias] and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">montes angusti</i>. In the various ‘dips’ the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hostium
copiae</i> would have been very conspicuous.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Behind the low rampart between Kingsdown and Walmer Castle
the ground rises. Caesar might have encamped [in his first expedition]
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_737">737</span>
on this rising ground or on the rising ground which extends behind
the castle towards the church.</p>

<p>Just after passing Deal Castle one turns to the left down Gilford
Road, and, after walking about 300 yards, passes under a railway
bridge, and then, very gradually ascending for a few paces, walks
along a path, which crosses fields. It seemed to me just possible
that C. might have encamped on these fields, but very&mdash;to the last
degree&mdash;unlikely.</p>

<p>The only suitable camping-grounds that I can see anywhere are
those mentioned above. 16.9.02.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Walked over the cliffs from St. Margaret’s to Walmer.... After
walking for a short distance along the edge of this [natural] rampart
[south of Walmer Castle], I struck inland along a fence, and
came to a path which traverses a rolling chalk plateau, and runs
exactly in a straight line with the tower of St. Mary’s Church,
Walmer. There is splendid camping-ground on this plateau. The
camp would have commanded the approaches from every point of
the compass; and the descent from the plateau on the west or
landward side is steep. Beyond the valley which bounds the plateau
on this side the ground rises again fairly rapidly. The plateau
extends northward to a point just south of Walmer Castle, which
it commands. If Caesar encamped on the plateau, the camp could
be discovered by excavation: but if he encamped on the gently
rising ground north-west of the plateau, the camp could not be
discovered; for this ground is covered by buildings. (I assume of
course that he did not encamp on the high ground west of the
plateau or on the ground on which the windmill stands; for both
sites are too far from the sea.) 17.9.02.

forts ... the loose stones below the vitrification (<i>sic</i>) are supported by
ordinary masonry, which apparently might have been carried up the

<p><span class="smcap">Pages 581-3.</span> ‘There is one passage ... anchorage.’ The argument in
this paragraph depends upon the assumption that the ships which were
‘carried back’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">referrentur</i>) in 55 <b>B. C.</b> to the port from which they had
started were laid to, and that they could not lie within less than four points
and a half of the wind, or, if, with Falconer and James Smith, we allow
six points for leeway, within less than two and a half. It may not perhaps
be impertinent to explain that when a ship is laid to her head is brought
as close to the wind as possible without losing way, under little sail. In
these circumstances the helm is often lashed, and the ship then has a
tendency to yaw, that is, to fall off the wind and come up again
alternately. An experienced seaman with whom I have recently discussed
the matter believes, however, that it might have been practicable
for the captains of the ships in question to adopt the plan of ‘head
reaching’, that is, working to windward under comparatively low sail but
still enough to enable the steersmen to keep the ships under control, to
luff up to dangerous seas, and to make considerable headway. As he
remarked, the difference between lying to, when the helm is not lashed,
and ‘head reaching’ is simply one of degree: in ‘head reaching’ the
vessel carries a little more sail; and, judging from illustrations of ancient
ships, he thinks that Caesar’s would have been able, when ‘head reaching’,
to lie within two points of the wind. Allowing five points for leeway,
he holds that they could have made good a course within seven points;
and he insists that an ancient ship with its sails properly trimmed could
have gone as near the wind as a modern lugger!</p>

<p>This, I need hardly say, is rank heresy, and I do not believe that any one
who is conversant with the literature of ancient navigation will accept it.
Besides, we do not know whether Gallic ships were rigged exactly like
those of the Mediterranean. James Smith (<cite>The Voyage and Shipwreck of
St. Paul</cite>, 1880, pp. 75, 127, 215) may or may not have been right in maintaining
that an ancient ship could not make good a course in moderate
weather within less than about seven points of the wind; but numerous
passages prove that ancient ships, if they could work to windward, could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_741">741</span>
not do so without difficulty. If my heretical friend is right, why were
Caesar’s cavalry transports windbound in the <cite>ulterior portus</cite>, less than eight
miles from the port which their captains wished to make, and why were
they obliged by contrary winds to put back, even in moderate weather,
after they first started from the <cite>ulterior portus</cite>? M. Jules Vars, indeed
(<cite>L’art nautique dans l’antiquité</cite>, 1887, pp. 181 ff.), apparently doubts whether
ancient ships could work to windward at all; but a passage which James
Smith quotes from one of Cicero’s letters (<cite>Fam.</cite>, xiv, 5, § 1)&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum sane
adversis ventis usi essemus tardeque et incommode navigassemus</i>&mdash;and another
in Livy, which I am obliged to quote at second hand&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hinc atque hinc ad
ventos obliqua transferre vela</i>&mdash;suggest, if they do not prove, that they
could. I hope to discuss the question soon in another place. Meanwhile
it is enough to say that if Caesar’s cavalry transports could
not work to windward, they could neither ‘head-reach’ nor lie to;
and those which were carried back to their port of departure must have
fetched it by sailing with the wind nearly abeam. But those which were
‘driven down in great peril to the lower and more westerly part of the
island’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad inferiorem partem insulae quae est propius solis occasum magno
suo cum periculo deicerentur</i>) were evidently scudding; and while the
word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">referrentur</i> (‘were carried back’), which is strongly contrasted with
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deicerentur</i>, suggests that the others were laid to, Caesar’s words show that
they were comparatively in little danger, though, if they had not been
brought close to the wind, they would evidently have run as great a risk
as the others. A distinguished admiral suggests to me that they did sail
with the wind nearly abeam, and disposes of the question of danger by
assuming that Caesar exaggerated its force. But, with due deference, I
would ask whether, since it was strong enough to drive ashore and wreck
ships which were riding at anchor, and since the ships that ran before it
were ‘in great peril’, ships sailing with it nearly abeam would not have
been in peril equally great. It is universally admitted that ancient ships
could sail with the wind abeam: it seems hardly credible that the discovery
should not have followed that Gallic ships, which were not shallow, <i>could</i>
also make headway within less than eight points of the wind; and I
therefore believe that, however rare, from one cause or another, tacking
may have been, ships were occasionally laid to in bad weather.</p>

<p>Anyhow, my argument remains unshaken. If the ships which were
carried back to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i> neither lay to nor ‘head-reached’, it is
self-evident that they could not have fetched Sangatte, and therefore that
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i> was Ambleteuse: if they sailed with the wind abeam,
they could not have fetched any port east of Wissant: if they were laid to,
they could not have fetched Sangatte; nor could they have done so even
if they ‘head-reached’ unless they possessed a capacity for working to
windward with which few modern ships and no ancient ship can be credited.
Indeed they could not have done so even then; for it would evidently
have been impossible for them to beat across the Channel in a single tide:
the flood (see p. 583) would hardly have helped them; and the ebb, prolonged
and strengthened by the north-easterly gale, would have carried
them far out of their course.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks apply of course to other passages in which I have
mentioned the cavalry transports. By no means could they have
returned either from near Hythe or Lympne to Ambleteuse or from near
Pevensey to the mouth of the Authie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Page 680.</span> ‘Therefore, unless ... Bekesbourne.’ Mr. George Barrow
of the Geological Survey, whom I have consulted, thinks that there is no
reason to suppose that the relative level of water and banks in the Little
Stour above Littlebourne was appreciably different in 54 <small>B.C.</small> from what
it is now.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_742">742</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Page 698.</span> ‘The claim ... better grounds.’ Mr. F. H. Baring (<cite>Eng.
Hist. Rev.</cite>, October, 1907, pp. 726-8) argues that Caesar crossed the Thames
by ‘an undoubted ford just above tidewater at Hampton’, which was
mentioned by Lord Lumley in 1685. He argues that, owing to the tides,
Brentford would only have been available for ‘five or six hours out of
twelve’; that ‘this important fact would surely have been mentioned’;
and that the stakes which have been found at Brentford are fifteen inches
round and therefore too large. I am not sure that he is referring to the
stakes described by Mr. Montagu Sharpe, whom he does not mention; but
surely the stakes would not have answered their purpose worse for being
strong. I do not believe that Caesar would have mentioned the presence
of tides at Brentford if they had not affected his passage; but, as we have
seen (p. 696), Mr. Spurrell has argued that the tides did not reach Brentford.
If there was a ford at Hampton before the days of locks and weirs,
there was another, if the evidence of the name <i>Halliford</i> is trustworthy,
at or near Coway Stakes. Are we entitled to assume that either existed
in the time of Caesar? The reader will have understood that I do not pin
my faith to Mr. Sharpe’s theory: I only think that it is less feebly
supported than any other.</p>

None of these excavators, however, was so thorough as Pitt-Rivers; and
Bateman was often careless (see H. St. G. Gray’s <cite>Index to ‘Excavations in
Cranborne Chase’</cite>, 1905, p. xvi). But it must be remembered that to do
such work properly, not only skill and perseverance are needed, but also money.</p></div>

Pitt-Rivers remarks (<cite>Excavations in Cranborne Chase</cite>, iii, 1892, pp. x, 254)
that a rampart almost always yields something, for example, pottery, which
throws light on the period of its construction; while his experience shows
the importance of ‘digging the whole of a camp over, down to the undisturbed
soil’ (<i>ib.</i>, iv, 14 [preface]). He tells us (<i>ib.</i>, p. 4) that when he was excavating
the earthwork called South Lodge Camp, ‘in the first three sections little or
nothing was found, which shows what very false conceptions are liable to be
formed by merely digging one or two sections in a camp.’ See also vol. iii,
pp. xi, 13; vol. iv, pp. 46-8, 138, 144, 187; <cite>Trans. Epping Forest ... Naturalists’

The following passage from Sir John Evans’s <cite>Ancient Bronze Implements ... of
Great Britain and Ireland</cite>, 1880, pp. 25-6, is instructive:&mdash;‘In company
with Sir John Lubbock I was engaged in opening a grave [at Hallstatt] in
which we had come to an interment of the Early Iron Age, accompanied by
a socketed celt and spear-heads of iron, when amidst the bones I caught sight
of a thin metallic disc of a yellowish colour which looked like a coin. Up to
that time no coin had ever been found in any one of the many hundred graves
which had been examined, and I eagerly picked up this disc. It proved to be
a “sechser”, or six-kreutzer piece, with the date 1826, which by some means
had worked its way down among the crevices in the stony ground.... Had this
coin been of Roman date it might have afforded an argument for bringing
down the date of the Hallstatt cemetery some centuries in the chronological
scale. As it is, it affords a wholesome caution against drawing important
inferences from the mere collocation of objects when there is any possibility
of the apparent association being only due to accident.’</p></div>

Mr. N. W. Thomas (<cite>Man</cite>, v, 1905, No. 25, pp. 47-8) points out that ‘some
five years ago the Berlin collections [of ethnographical objects] from British
possessions were seven times as large as those in our national museum, and
since then this disproportion has not been decreased’, the reason being that
‘the men whom the nation pays to perform certain duties [in national expeditions]
are permitted to retain the objects collected in the performance of those
duties’. But the nation is to blame as much as the Government.</p></div>

Sir A. Ramsay’s theory (<cite>Physical Geol. and Geogr. of Great Britain</cite>, 6th ed.,
1894, p. 269), that the basins of the Scottish and Cumbrian lakes were scooped
out of the rocks by glaciers, was held by no British geologist a few years ago,
except in a modified form. See A. J. Jukes-Browne, <cite>Student’s Handbook of

Garwood has recently investigated the Alpine lakes near Airolo, and holds
(<i>ib.</i>, p. 190) that, with a few possible exceptions, they ‘do not seem to be due
to ice-erosion’.</p></div>

observes that ‘although we have some evidence of more than one recurrence
of an ice-sheet in [Aberdeenshire] ... no evidence has hitherto been obtained
of warm intervals, further than that which may be inferred from the melting
away of the vast mass of ice which preceded and followed the deposition of the
Red Clay and the shell-bed at Clava and elsewhere. It must have taken a great
deal of heat to melt these enormous masses.’</p></div>

Is it certain that an elevation of seventy feet would not have been enough
to unite Britain with the Continent? For thousands of years the scour of the
tides must have been deepening the Channel. [On April 11, 1906, I submitted
to Mr. Clement Reid, in a conversation which I had with him at the Geological
Museum, the gist of the argument by which I endeavour to show (pp. 20-2,
<i>infra</i>) that during some part of the Palaeolithic Age Britain must have been
continental. He virtually admitted its force, remarking that an elevation of
seventy feet would have enabled animals to cross from Gaul to Britain, as the
scour of the tides had doubtless deepened the Channel.]</p></div>

This fact seems to have escaped the notice of a writer who argues (<cite>Nat.
Science</cite>, iii, 1893, pp. 261-6) that ‘England was not restocked by a land connexion
from the Continent after glaciation’, and affirms (p. 266) that ‘almost
the only evidence of a post-glacial connexion with the Continent is the supposed
necessity of such to account for our present fauna and flora’. The mammoth
fed upon coniferous trees, fragments of the wood of which have been found
in the crevices of its teeth (A. S. Woodward, <cite>Outlines of Vertebrate Palaeontology</cite>,

Sir Henry Howorth has written a series of articles (<cite>Geol. Mag.</cite>, 1892, pp. 250-8,
396-405; <cite>Nat. Science</cite>, xii, 1898, pp. 261-70), in which he claims to have
proved that ‘in no instance, so far as we know, does the drift actually underlie
any land surface containing the remains of the mammoth and of its contemporaries.’
Translated into the language of geologists to whom the glacial period
is not a nightmare, this is tantamount to an assertion that the mammoth was
neither postglacial, nor interglacial, nor glacial, but preglacial. Mr. A. J.
Jukes-Browne (<cite>Geol. Mag.</cite>, 1892, p. 575) replies that ‘gravels containing mammoth
remains occur in many other valleys [besides that of the Great Ouse],
which are generally considered to have been eroded out of a widespread
mantle of Glacial Drift’, and that ‘this conclusion is not shaken by anything
which Sir H. Howorth has written’; while Sir John Evans (<cite>Anc. Stone Implements</cite>,
1879, p. 701) remarks that ‘in some cases, as at Fisherton, the worked
flints have been found below the remains of mammoth’. Since the gravel
at Hoxne, in which bones of the mammoth and of extinct animals contemporary
with the mammoth were found (Sir J. Evans, <cite>Anc. Stone Implements</cite>, 1897,
pp. 573-5; C. Reid, <cite>Origin of the Brit. Flora</cite>, p. 77; <cite>Guide to the Ant. of
the Stone Age</cite> [Brit. Museum], p. 20), was shown by the committee who
excavated it (<cite>Report of ... the Brit. Association</cite>, 1896, pp. 400-11) to be
later than the latest glaciation of the district, Sir Henry naturally discredited
their report; and he did so by declaring (<cite>Nat. Science</cite>, xii, 1898, p 266) that
the members of the committee were ‘already committed ... to the view that
the implement-bearing deposit at Hoxne was newer than the Drift. This,’
he continued, ‘was not very promising.... It was, in fact, indecent.’</p></div>

Professor Boyd Dawkins (<cite>Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.</cite>, xxiii, 1867, pp. 91-109,
and especially pp. 106-9) has argued that the Lower Brick-Earths in the
Thames Valley, under which implements have been found, were preglacial,&mdash;locally,
I presume. He observed that not one of ‘the Post-glacial Arctic
mammalia’, namely, the glutton, lemming, marmot, musk-sheep, elk, and
reindeer, is represented in this deposit, and maintains that, on the other hand,
the presence of <cite>Elephas priscus</cite> and the big-nosed rhinoceros (<cite>Rhinoceros
megarhinus</cite>) ‘indicates the affinity of the [Brick-Earth] group to the Praeglacial
deposits of Norfolk’, &amp;c. Prestwich, however (<i>ib.</i>, xxviii, 1872, p. 445),
differed from the professor; and Sir John Evans (<i>ib.</i>, p. 446) remarked that
if the brick-earth were preglacial ‘there would be a great difficulty in accounting
for the presence of the high beds at Shackleton and Highbury, as these,
though in a valley confessedly excavated by the river, and regarded as of
more recent age than the lower beds, would yet be at a far higher level’.</p></div>

As Mr. Clement Reid points out (ib., pp. 36-7), Prestwich’s implement ‘was
not found in place, but picked up among fallen material.... The Alderbury
gravel,’ he remarks, ‘judging from its less elevation above the river, is probably
newer than the supposed Palaeolithic gravel north of Redlynch; yet it yields
implements of more ancient type.’ See also <cite>Journ. Anthr. Inst.</cite>, xxxv, 1905,

flints have been found are not necessarily of Pliocene date, as they may have
been <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">remaniés</i>. Eoliths are said to have been unearthed from gravels at
Dewlish in Dorsetshire side by side with the bones of the extinct elephant

but these flints were so battered that Mr. Reid, who accepts many eoliths as
genuine tools and regards them as ‘bad palaeoliths’, was obliged to reject them
(<cite>Memoirs Geol. Survey,&mdash;The Geology of the Country around Ringwood</cite>, p. 36).</p></div>

<p>Sir John Evans, who is unable to accept the authenticity of any eoliths, nevertheless
believes, or did believe in 1897 (<cite>Anc. Stone Implements</cite>, pp. 608-9),
that the palaeolithic implements which have been found on the plateau belonged
to a time when the ‘continuous slope now extending from the neighbourhood
of the Thames to the summit of the chalk escarpment’ was ‘continued southward ... over
a part of what is now the Lower Greensand area, if not, indeed,
into that of the Weald’. In other words he believed that the palaeoliths
were as old as the eoliths, and therefore that the question of the authenticity
of the latter was unimportant. It is, however, now generally recognized that
this view was based upon a misconception. Mr. Harrison (<cite>Outline of the
Hist. of the Eol. Flint Implements</cite>, p. 17) states that ‘<i>palaeoliths and eoliths
have been found together only on the surface and never in the drifts in situ</i>’.
Cf. J. Prestwich, <cite>Controverted Questions</cite>, p. 64.</p>

<p>Mr. Clement Reid (<cite>Vict. Hist. of ... Hampshire</cite>, i, 34) sees no reason for
believing that any of the Kentish eoliths are older than palaeolithic implements
in general. In a conversation which I had with him on April 11, 1906, he
remarked that the patches of drift in which the eoliths had been found were
generally dominated by higher ground, and that he could find no evidence
that the flints had been washed down from the Weald. Eoliths have, however,
been found in a pit at Terry’s Lodge ‘on the summit of the escarpment
at a height of 770 feet’ (<cite>Journ. Anthr. Inst.</cite>, xxxv, 1905, p. 300. Cf. <cite>Essex

<p>Sir John Evans (<cite>Anc. Stone Implements</cite>, 1897, pp. 634-5, 690-93) has argued
that the implementiferous gravel which caps the cliff at Bournemouth was
deposited by the Solent river; but Mr. Clement Reid thinks it ‘very doubtful
whether it was a deposit formed by ordinary river action’ (<cite>Vict. Hist. of ...
Hampshire</cite>, i, 34); and (<i>ib.</i>, pp. 27-8, 34) he is inclined to believe that the
continuity of the Isle of Wight with Hampshire and Dorsetshire was already
interrupted in late Pliocene times, though the Solent may perhaps have been
merely an estuary and not a strait even in the time of the so-called interglacial
estuarine deposits. See p. 20, <i>supra</i>.</p></div>

calculates that the earliest settlement at Knossos in Crete (which was <i>neolithic</i>)
is about 12,000 years old; but he assumes that in the western court of the
palace ‘the average rate of deposit was fairly continuous’. Prof. Montelius
(<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>, xvii, 1906, p. 137) argues from the stratigraphy of finds at Susa that
the beginning of the Neolithic Age in the East may be dated about 18,000 <small>B.C.</small>
But even if these calculations could be established, it would still remain doubtful
whether our Palaeolithic Age was not partly contemporary with a neolithic
civilization in more genial climates. Probably it was (<i>ib.</i>, p. 164). Against
the theory which would minimize the antiquity of the Palaeolithic Age, see

<p>Mr. Clement Reid, as those who are familiar with his writings must have
seen, does not believe that many of the deposits classed as river-drift (see
Evans’s <cite>Anc. Stone Implements</cite>, 1897, pp. 662-709, especially 679) deserve
that title. In a conversation which I had with him on April 11, 1906, he
remarked that he could see no reason to suppose that palaeolithic man ‘was
an aquatic animal’; that much of the so-called river-drift would probably
be found, under minute examination, not to be due to fluviatile action; and
that the geology of the Thames Valley, which in the Glacial Epoch was on the
edge of the ice, presented great difficulties. See, however, Mr. H. B. Woodward’s
article in <cite>Vict. Hist. of ... Buckingham</cite>, i, 22.</p></div>

Prof. Boyd Dawkins (<cite>Early Man in Britain</cite>, p. 192) says that, except
at Pont Newydd, ‘the association of traces of man with the remains of hippopotamus
has, as yet, not been observed in any bone caves either in this country
or on the Continent’. Sir John Evans, who does not mention such remains
in his notice of Pont Newydd (<cite>Anc. Stone Implements</cite>, 1897, p. 521), records
their discovery, without associated implements, in the ‘mid-terrace gravels’
near Acton (<i>ib.</i>, p. 591), and in gravels of the same character as those which
yield implements, near Bedford (p. 533) and at Folkestone (p. 621). Evidently
(pp. 699-700, with which cf. Boyd Dawkins and W. Ayshford, <cite>Brit. Pleistocene

that Ezekiel (viii. 10-11), speaking of seventy of ‘the ancients of the
house of Israel’ who were worshipping in a court, says that he saw therein
‘every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts ... pourtrayed upon

used in magical ceremonies; whereas it has been proved by Dr. O. Schoetensack

actuated by sexual jealousy, ‘expelled all his adult sons as they came to puberty.’
Such a group, he remarks, would have been ‘necessarily exogamous in practice’,
and then (<i>ib.</i>, p. 143) would have come the rule, ‘No marriage
within the local group.’ But would it have been to the interest of the master
to expel sons who were useful? What would have become of them? Would
not the same sexual jealousy that <cite>ex hypothesi</cite> prompted their expulsion have
prevented the master of any other group from receiving them? And if the
master was killed in hunting after he had expelled his sons, what became of
the other members of the group?</p>

M. S. Reinach’s explanation of this passage (<cite>Rev. celt.</cite>, xxi, 1900, p. 275)

<cite>Journ. Anthr. Inst.</cite>, xxviii, 1899, pp. 141, 143-4, 148. M. Reinach seems
to make this assumption when he says (see preceding note) that we are justified
in affirming that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘chez certaines tribus au moins de la Bretagne, le lièvre, l’oie
et la poule étaient des animaux sacrés, c’est-à-dire, des totems’</span>. I am glad
to find that M. Camille Jullian (<cite>Rev. des études anc.</cite>, iv, 1902, p. 274) also
rejects M. Reinach’s guess; but he continues, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Je suis, du reste, convaincu,
avec M. Reinach, que les Celtes ont connu le totémisme ... par exemple, si
<i>bran(n)os</i> signifie ... “le corbeau”, une tribu gauloise avait pris cet oiseau
pour totem ... <i>Aulerci Brannovices</i>,’</span> &amp;c. On the much surer evidence of
such names as Bull, Lamb, Herring, Roach, and many others, M. Jullian
might conclude that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘les Anglais du vingtième siècle connaissent le totémisme’</span>.
It is perhaps reasonable to conjecture that the name <i>Brannovices</i> may point
to a remote age when the ancestors of the historic Celts had totems: but it is
quite certain that the Celts of whom M. Jullian is thinking knew nothing about
totemism; and the superstitions which forbade the Britons to eat hares, geese,
and fowls, may have been absolutely unconnected with totemism. See Lord
Avebury’s <cite>Origin of Civilisation</cite>, 1902, p. 19. Miss Eleanor Hull (<cite>Folk-Lore</cite>,
xii, 1901, p. 49) observes that ‘there is one example of what appears to be
a true totemistic idea in those [Irish] stories.... It is in Cúchulainn’s prohibition
to eat the flesh of a hound because it was his namesake.’</p></div>

It is impossible to tell whether in Ancient Britain oxen were at any time

the Libyans, the ancestors of the Greeks, and other primitive peoples, their

This use of the word ‘dolmen’, which obtains in France, although megalithic
chambers enclosed in tumuli are there sometimes called by the same
name (<cite>Archaeol. Cambr.</cite>, 5th ser., xvii, 1900, p. 221), is becoming common
in this country; but in Wales dolmens are still known as cromlechs, a name
which in France is applied only to stone circles.</p></div>

Professor B. C. A. Windle (<cite>Remains of the Prehist. Age</cite>, p. 257) affirms that
excavations in the stronghold of Eggardun in Dorsetshire have proved that
‘pit-dwellings were in use in the Pre-metallic period’; and he remarks (<i>ib.</i>,
p. 258) that there was ‘no trace of any metallic object in the pits examined
by Stevens at Hurstbourne or in those at Standlake’ in Oxfordshire. It is
shown on p. 97, <i>infra</i>, that there is no sufficient reason for referring Eggardun
to the Neolithic Age: bronze was discovered at Standlake (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>,
xxxvii, 1857, p. 368), which, according to Pitt-Rivers (<cite>Excavations in Cranborne
Chase</cite>, i, 20-1), bore such an ‘exact resemblance to the [Romano-British]
Woodcuts village’, that, in his judgement, ‘further excavations would have
proved it to have been of the Roman or Late-Celtic period’: Romano-British
pottery was found in the pits at Hurstbourne; and Dr. Stevens himself
(<cite>Parochial Hist. of St. Mary Bourne</cite>, 1888, p. 34) only claimed that ‘the flint
implements ... establish that the site, if not the dwellings, was occupied by
the people of the Neolithic Age’. Professor Boyd Dawkins (<cite>Vict. Hist. of ...
Hants</cite>, i, 262) rightly refers the dwellings to the Iron Age.</p>

<p>Bone weaving-combs, which were found in pit-dwellings at Highfield, near
Fisherton in Wiltshire, evidently belonged, like the querns with which they
were associated (J. Stevens, <cite>Parochial Hist. of St. Mary Bourne</cite>, p. 25), to the
Early Iron Age (cf. Sir J. Evans, <cite>Ancient Stone Implements</cite>, 1897, p. 251, and
<cite>Reliquary</cite>, N. S., vii, 1901, p. 115); and although Professor Boyd Dawkins
(<cite>Early Man</cite>, &amp;c., p. 268) pleads that the pottery, which was ‘ornamented
with incised curves’, was ‘not turned in the lathe’, that does not prove that
it was made in the Neolithic or even the Bronze Age (see p. 244, <i>infra</i>); while
the ‘curves’ suggest that it was Late Celtic.</p></div>

<i>Ib.</i>, p. 140. Stone mounds have been discovered in South Wales by
Messrs. T. C. Cantrill and O. T. Jones, who regard them as ‘probably the
remains of prehistoric hearths or cooking-places’ (<cite>Archaeol. Cambr.</cite>, 6th ser.,
vi, 1906, p. 17); but, as they ‘range in diameter from 6 feet or so to as much

stature.</p>

A chambered mound in Stromness, Orkney, which was not a sepulchre
but a dwelling, has also been recently excavated, and contained a stone implement
(<cite>Proc. Soc. Ant. Scot.</cite>, xxxvii, 1903, pp. 352-9). Mr. Christison (<i>ib.</i>,
xxxviii, 1904, pp. 5-6) tentatively refers it to the Neolithic Age, while the
discoverer more cautiously says that it must have been built in ‘a remote
period, not ... because the implement is made of <i>stone</i>, but because the type
is an ancient one’.</p></div>

‘that mankind was led to wear such objects by magic rather than by aesthetic
considerations ... the use of all the objects still employed in modern jewellery
has primarily arisen from the magical powers attributed to them, by which they
were thought to protect the wearer.’ M. Salomon Reinach’s review (<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>,

The primitive method was apparently scraping (<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>, viii, 1897,
p. 204). M. Hippolyte Müller (<i>ib.</i>, xiv, 1903, pp. 430-4) has performed the
operation on four skulls by scraping with a flint implement; and he concludes
that this method was adopted in the case of living patients. It appears (<i>ib.</i>,
p. 434) that the distinguished anthropologist, M. Capitan, has been impelled
by scientific ardour to experiment ‘sur plusieurs chiens vivants’. What will
happen if the Anti-Vivisection Society hears of this?</p></div>

It should be noted that pottery of the types that characterized the Bronze
Age was still manufactured in the Early Iron Age. See p. 244, <i>infra</i>. Fragments
of pottery were found in the long barrow of West Kennet in Wiltshire;
but Thurnam (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, xlii, 1869, p. 231) regards it as ‘very doubtful
whether they belong to the people by whom the chamber was erected’. They
seem to have been portions of ‘food-vessels’, which belong to the Bronze
Age (see p. 191, <i>infra</i>); and Pitt-Rivers (<cite>Excavations in Cranborne Chase</cite>, iv, 1898,
pp. 100, 163) says that they ‘must probably have got in subsequently to the
construction of the barrow’. See also <i>ib.</i>, pp. 147 and 162 (fig. 8); and, for
examples of round-bottomed domestic pottery which have been found both in
long barrows and in certain round barrows that may have been erected in the
Stone Age, see <cite>Brit. Barrows</cite>, pp. 488-9, 509, and J. R. Mortimer, <cite>Forty Years’
Researches</cite>, p. lxviii.</p>

<p>The Scottish chambered cairns have yielded more pottery than the English
barrows. Most of the vessels lacked decoration; but some were ornamented
either with cord patterns or by impressions of the potter’s finger-tips and nails,
or with vertical flutings; while a chambered cairn at Unstan, in Orkney,
contained a vessel with triangular ornament of a kind which, as we shall see
(pp. 197-8, <i>infra</i>), was characteristic of the Bronze Age. It may, however, have
been manufactured at a time when bronze was coming into use in Southern
Britain. See <cite>Proc. Soc. Ant. Scot.</cite>, xix, 1885, pp. 346-8, and J. Anderson,
<cite>Scotland in Pagan Times,&mdash;the Bronze and Stone Ages</cite>, pp. 240, 248-9, 252,
272-3, 294-7.</p>

<p>Some of the ‘drinking-cups’ which have been exhumed from round barrows
doubtless belong to the end of the Neolithic Age (see pp. 192-3, <i>infra</i>); and a
curious vessel, which Bateman (<cite>Vestiges of the Ant. of Derbyshire</cite>, 1848, p. 43)
described as ‘a small drinking or incense cup of novel and unprecedented
shape’, was found in a round barrow the neolithic age of which is certain.

Gen. Pitt-Rivers (<cite>Journ. Anthr. Inst.</cite>, vi, 1877, pp. 359-60), after remarking
that in the region between Seaford and Beachy Head ‘the <i>débris</i> of flint
manufacture is so far abundant on the surface ... that the fact of finding
flint flakes in the interior of these entrenchments [Seaford and Beltout] is no
proof whatever of their being of the age of these entrenchments’, goes on to
say that ‘this does not apply to other parts of the Downs of Sussex and elsewhere.
There, worked flints are found in patches here and there; but considerable
distances may be traversed without coming to these patches, and
the fact of finding them in unusual numbers in the insides of these earthworks
remains to testify to the probability of their having been used by the inhabitants
of them.’</p></div>

<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, xlii, 1869, p. 109. Mr. J. R. Mortimer (<cite>Forty Years’ Researches</cite>,
&amp;c., 1905, p. lxxxi) is ‘slightly inclined to consider that the long barrows
[of the Yorkshire Wolds] ... are more recent than the greater number of the
round ones’; but the only reason which he gives for this singular opinion,
namely, that he has frequently found both long and round skulls in the round
barrows of the same district, has no weight against the facts which have led all
other investigators to regard the long as earlier than the round barrows.
See p. 393, <i>infra</i>. Not only has no metal ever been found with a primary
interment in a long barrow, but sepulchral pottery is also wanting. See <cite>Man</cite>,
v, 1905, No. 86, p. 159. If the contents of certain long barrows ‘do not show
any features of interest differing from those found in [some] round barrows’
(<cite>Forty Years’ Researches</cite>, p. xix), that only suggests that long barrows were
still made for some time after the first interment in a round barrow took place.

See, however, p. 108, and p. 109, n. 2, <i>infra</i>. According to Dr. R. Munro
(<cite>Prehist. Scotland</cite>, 1899, p. 325), ‘Although many [Scottish] graves have been
examined which contained ... stone and nothing of bronze, it does not follow
that they were earlier than others in which bronze articles were found. It
seems to me’, he continues, ‘that the vast majority of the sepulchral memorials
hitherto explored within the Scottish area date from the introduction of
bronze’.</p>

<p>The evidence that the Scottish chambered tombs belonged to the Scottish
Stone Age is precisely the same as that which is almost unanimously accepted
for the English long barrows. Since we find that not a single article of bronze
has ever been found with a primary interment in a Scottish chambered cairn,
while bronze is abundant in the short cists and unchambered cairns of the
same country; that the skeletons in chambered cairns belong to the same
stock as the people who built the long barrows (see pp. 393-4, <i>infra</i>); and that
the chambered cairns and the chambered long barrows are structurally akin, we
may infer that the former, like the latter, belonged to the Stone Age. That,
however, some of them may have been built after bronze had been introduced
into Southern Britain is not improbable.</p></div>

An oval cairn, however, at Pawton in East Cornwall (W. C. Lukis, <cite>The

a cist, apparently contemporary with its erection, and is therefore presumably
later than the chambered round barrows. It has been suggested (<cite>Vict. Hist.
of ... Derby</cite>, i, 175-6) that the oval form of some barrows may be due to the
addition, following secondary interments, of new material.</p></div>

cairns have no passages of entrance. Their outline was commonly rectangular,
the ground-plan being defined by flagstones, arranged at one end in a semi-circle,
the space within which led to a low portal that gave access to the
chamber. The latter consisted of two sections, one above the other, of which
the lower was built of large lateral slabs, covered by flagstones, and divided
by other slabs into compartments, while the upper was formed of small flags
laid horizontally.</p>

<i>Ib.</i>, xxxvi, 1902, pp. 154-5. The chronology of the peculiar chambered
cairns of South-Western Scotland is somewhat perplexing. On the one hand
the structure of the cairns is presumptive evidence that they were built in
neolithic times (J. Anderson, <cite>Scotland in Pagan Times,&mdash;the Bronze and Stone
Ages</cite>, pp. 271-2; <cite>Proc. Soc. Ant. Scot.</cite>, xxxvi, 1902, p. 136); the successive
interments which were made in them were characteristic of the same period
(<i>ib.</i>, p. 134); the pottery which they contained is almost all of neolithic type
(<i>ib.</i>, pp. 165-7; xxxviii, 1904, pp. 78-9); and the presence of drinking-cups
does not necessarily point to a later date (p. 193, <i>infra</i>). On the other hand
a perforated stone hammer, which was found in one of the chambers (<i>ib.</i>,
xxxvi, 1902, p. 100), belongs to a class of implements which in this country
were generally post-neolithic (p. 78, <i>supra</i>); an elegant bowl which was
obtained by Canon Greenwell in a cairn on Largie Farm, near Crinan (<cite>Proc.
Soc. Ant. Scot.</cite>, xxxvi, 1902, pp. 165-7), although neolithic in form, is somewhat
similar to a food-vessel figured in <cite>Brit. Barrows</cite>, p. 88, fig. 73, which,
like it, is ornamented with vertical flutings; and one of the drinking-cups
deposited in the same cairn is ‘almost identical in size, shape, and ornamentation’
with a specimen that was associated with a bronze dagger in a barrow on
Roundway Hill, Wiltshire (<cite>Proc. Soc. Ant. Scot.</cite>, vi, 1867, pp. 345, n. 1, 347).
I conclude that these cairns were locally of neolithic age, but that the influence
of the later culture had made itself felt in the district,&mdash;in short, that they
belonged to a period of transition.</p></div>

(see p. 105, <i>supra</i>) Pitt-Rivers discovered six skeletons ‘huddled together
beneath a small mound’, which was within and distinct from the monument
itself. Three of them were crouched, and the rest ‘put in with them as bones,
with the long-bones laid out by the side of the skull’. Referring to a discovery
made in Egypt by Professor Flinders Petrie, Pitt-Rivers observes that the
bones of a skeleton of the Fifth Dynasty (about 3500 <small>B.C.</small>) ‘had been cut up and
put in a box, with an effigy of the deceased by the side of it. Something of
this sort’, he continues, ‘may have occurred here’.</p></div>

M. Salomon Reinach (<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>, xvi, 1905, p. 659) characteristically remarks
in regard to the discovery of metals that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘On l’explique ordinairement par une
succession de hasards heureux, en oubliant que l’humanité primitive, n’ayant
aucune idée de l’utilisation industrielle des métaux, ne pouvait en arriver là du
premier coup.... Aujourd’hui toute la métallurgie primitive me semble un
chapitre de l’histoire des religions.... On a soumis ces métaux [gold and tin]
à l’action du feu, au cours d’opérations magiques; ainsi naquit l’idée de traiter
de même les minerais de cuivre ... et d’en dégager le métal brillant qui ressemble
à l’or.... L’alchimie primitive, absolument étrangère à toute application
industrielle, chercha à manier des substances divines par l’action du feu, à
opérer ... des <i>hiérogamies</i> analogues à celle qui conduisit les agriculteurs à la
découverte de la griffe. L’alliage du bronze fut un des résultats de leurs
efforts.’</span></p>

<p>That smiths were sometimes regarded with superstitious awe by those who
did not share their secrets (O. Schrader, <cite>Prehist. Ant. of the Aryan Peoples</cite>,
pp. 165-8); that metallurgy was connected at various points with religion;&mdash;so
much may be granted. But to say that ‘primitive alchemy’ (if it existed)
had no industrial application is simply to make an unverifiable and improbable
assertion. The discovery that ores could be smelted must have been accidental.
Why should not the ‘alchemist’, however superstitious he may
have been, have thereupon conceived the idea of turning gold to account for
the manufacture of ornaments, or copper for that of axes?</p></div>

Montelius affirms (<cite>Man</cite>, v, 1905, No. 7, p. 13) that ‘copper had been used
there [in Britain] for a long time’ before bronze; but British archaeologists
do not bow to his authority. Pitt-Rivers (<cite>Journ. Roy. United Service Inst.</cite>,
xiii, 1870, p. 520) remarked that ‘it is not surprising that on the first discovery
of the advantages of [adding tin to copper] ... all the old implements of copper,
wherever procurable, should have been taken to the melting-pot for conversion
into bronze, and we should thus be left with such scanty evidence of the
existence of an age of copper’. Still we have sufficient evidence for Ireland,
and not for Britain. Professor Gowland (<cite>Journ. Anthr. Inst.</cite>, xxxvi, 1906,
p. 23) attributes the scarcity of copper celts in England to ‘the occurrence of
mixed copper and tin ores in Cornwall.’</p></div>

<cite>Man</cite>, iii, 1903, No. 8, pp. 147-9. Professor Montelius (<i>ib.</i>, v, 1905, No. 7,
pp. 13-4) denies that iron was used by the Egyptians before the fifteenth
century <small>B.C.</small>, and insists that the lump of iron oxide which was found at
Abydos in association with copper implements of the Sixth Dynasty, or about
3200 <small>B.C.</small>, ‘does not prove the <i>use</i> of iron, only the existence of that metal’.
The professor doubtless wrote ‘existence’ by a slip for ‘knowledge’. But,
as Mr. H. R. Hall points out (<i>ib.</i>, No. 40, pp. 69-71), he ignores the discovery
in the Great Pyramid of a piece of worked iron, which is now in the Third
Egyptian Room of the British Museum (Case K 29, No. 2433), and to which
a date about 300 years older ‘is assigned on good <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</i> grounds’; and
Mr. Hall reasonably asks whether the discovery of the lump of iron oxide
does not corroborate the other. It is unlikely that an unworked lump of iron
would have been deposited along with copper tools; and we may fairly suppose
that the lump is the remains of an iron tool.</p></div>

Professor Boyd Dawkins (<cite>Early Man in Britain</cite>, pp. 408-9) has compiled
tables which show that the percentage of tin in British bronze implements
varies between 5.09 and 18.31, and in French between 1.50 and 21.5. He
concludes (<i>ib.</i>, p. 410) that ‘the uniformity of the composition of the cutting
implements of the Bronze Age implies that the art of compounding tin with copper
was discovered in one place, from which the knowledge of it spread over ...
Europe and Asia, and the greater part of the Americas. Had it spread from
separate centres, this uniformity would have been impossible.’ The uniformity
which subsists between 5.09 and 18.31, and between 1.50 and 21.5 is remarkable.</p></div>

I am glad to find that I have the support of Mr. C. H. Read (<cite>Guide to the
Ant. of the Bronze Age</cite>, p. 78) and Mr. Reginald Smith (<cite>Guide to the Ant. of the
Early Iron Age</cite>, 1905, p. 122), who unhesitatingly refer the Dorsetshire hill-forts
in general to ‘the Bronze, and possibly, in some cases, the Neolithic
period’. Mr. H. St. G. Gray strains Pitt-Rivers’s doctrine when he argues
(<cite>Index to Excavations in Cranborne Chase</cite>, 1905, p. xix; <cite>Proc. Somerset.
Archaeol. and Nat. Hist. Soc.</cite>, 3rd ser., ix, 1903 <a id="FNanchor_1905" href="#Footnote_1905" class="fnanchor">1905</a>, p. 28) that, without
excavation, it is idle to express any opinion as to the age of a camp. He says
that ‘Caesar’s Camp’ at Folkestone ‘was always considered to be pre-Roman
before Lane-Fox excavated it and proved it to be of Norman construction’
This remark is incorrect (see <cite>Excavations in Cranborne Chase</cite>, iii, p. xi), and,
even if it were true, would only prove that less was known about the principles
of construction of prehistoric British camps in former days than now. I cannot
conceive how anybody could on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> grounds suppose ‘Caesar’s Camp’
to be pre-Roman, even if he had only seen the plan on the 25-inch O. S. map.
Of course I freely admit that, without excavation, it would be generally (though
not always) idle to express any opinion as to the particular prehistoric epoch
to which a fort belonged.</p>

<p>Dr. Joseph Anderson (<cite>Scotland in Pagan Times,&mdash;the Bronze and Stone Ages</cite>,
p. 139, with which cf. D. Christison, <cite>Early Fortifications in Scotland</cite>, 1898,
pp. 350-3, 380-1) observes that no one Scottish fort ‘can be assigned with
certainty to the Bronze Age’; but it is nevertheless morally certain that
many did then exist.</p>

<p>Mr. R. Burnard (<cite>Vict. Hist. of ... Devon</cite>, i, 366) remarks that it is unsafe
to infer from the fact that Cranbrook Castle, in the valley of the Teign, contained
pottery of Bronze Age type, that it belonged to that period; for such
pottery was also used in the Early Iron Age. Certainly it was; and so also were
bronze implements (see pp. 266-7, <i>infra</i>); but, as a rule, the discovery of Bronze
Age pottery, or bronze implements, unaccompanied by objects of the Early
Iron Age, is enough to raise a presumption, which in most instances would
be correct, that the site was occupied in the Bronze Age.</p></div>

Prof. F. J. Haverfield (<cite>Eng. Hist. Rev.</cite>, xix, 1904, p. 746) says that ‘the
scanty archaeological evidence hardly seems to justify ... Cornish mining so
early as <small>B.C.</small> 800’. But it does prove that bronze implements were made in
Britain in the earlier part of the Bronze Age,&mdash;considerably earlier than
800 <small>B.C.</small>; and the tin must have been obtained either from Cornwall, or from
Dartmoor, or from both. There is no evidence of prehistoric mining in Dartmoor,
and there is in Cornwall (pp. 502-3, n. 8, <i>infra</i>).</p></div>

pp. 365, 369) describes an ‘extensive labyrinth of entrenchments’, which
‘traversed the high grounds of the [Yorkshire] Wolds in every direction, forming
a network ... connecting hill to hill and valley to valley’. He states
(p. 379) that several round barrows have been mutilated by these entrenchments
‘in a manner which shows that the latter are the more recent’ [but
does not show that they are later than the Bronze Age], but that they are ‘at
least for the most part pre-Roman, being in several instances crossed by what
are believed to be portions of ... Roman roads’; and he concludes, disagreeing
with Pitt-Rivers (see p. 441, n. 2, <i>infra</i>), that they were intended to protect
cattle against robbers. In regard to the entrenchments near Flamborough
Head which Pitt Rivers excavated, I prefer his guidance.</p></div>

in Ireland and in various parts of Scotland, but, according to Dr. J. Anderson
(<cite>Proc. Soc. Ant. Scot.</cite>, xix, 1885, pp. 313-5; xxxix, 1905, pp. 14-20) and
Mr. C. H. Read (<cite>Guide</cite>, &amp;c., p. 30), not on the Continent. Dr. R. Munro,
however (<cite>Lake Dwellings of Europe</cite>, 1890, p. 290), affirms that they have been
found in the famous settlement of La Tène. They belonged indeed to the very
latest period of the Bronze Age, if not to the Early Iron Age (<cite>Anc. Bronze
Implements</cite>, p. 410). Only one cauldron of the flat-bottomed type has been
found in Scotland (<cite>Proc. Soc. Ant. Scot.</cite>, xxii, 1888, p. 36). The British cauldrons
of this kind differ in details from continental examples, especially in their
handles, which are rings, and may be of native manufacture. Anyhow, the
Heathery Burn Cave cauldron had been mended with a degree of skill which
shows that British workmen knew how to rivet plates together.</p></div>

Professor Boyd Dawkins (<cite>Early Man in Britain</cite>, pp. 360-2) remarks that
if a well-known amber cup, which was found at Hove, was of British workmanship,
it proves that the use of the lathe was known in Britain in the Bronze
Age. Sir John Evans (<cite>Anc. Stone Implements</cite>, 1897, pp. 445-50), like the
professor, thinks that the cup may have been imported; but he points out
that cups made of shale, which were certainly turned in a lathe, and were
most probably of British manufacture, have been found in round barrows on
Broad Down near Honiton. Sir R. C. Hoare (<cite>Anc. Wilts</cite>, i, 122-3) found in
the trunk of a tree inside a bowl barrow along with a skeleton an urn which he
described as ‘different both in shape and colour to any we have ever found
in the British sepulchres’, and which appeared to him to have been turned in
a lathe. Still the statement in the text is, generally speaking, true both of
the British Isles and of Northern and Western Europe.</p></div>

‘So called’, says Pitt-Rivers (<i>ib.</i>, i, 66), ‘because some of them are found
with an edge as sharp as a penknife’. The thought of shaving with a bronze
razor is not pleasant; but the negroes of Tanganyika still use razors of this
metal (<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>, xiv, 1903, pp. 667-75; xv, 1904, p. 116); and everybody

Dr. Joseph Anderson assigns these balls, which have been found only in
Scotland, to the Iron Age; but Mr. George Coffey (<cite>Journ. Roy. Soc. Ant.
Ireland</cite>, 5th ser., vi, 1896, p. 42) thinks that ‘the general character of these
spirals appears to be distinctly Bronze Age, not Late Celtic’. It has been
pointed out (<cite>Proc. Soc. Ant.</cite>, 2nd ser., xvi, 1895-7, pp. 408-9) that Mr. Coffey’s
theory is ‘strengthened by the fact that stone balls of this class have been
found associated with cist burials [of the Bronze Age] ... near Ballater, and ... [in]
Elginshire’.</p></div>

M. Salomon Reinach (<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>, iv, 1893, pp. 688-90), if I do not misunderstand
him, although he admits that the British Isles in the Bronze Age were
connected by trade with Scandinavia, thinks it probable that the spiral reached
the former by way of Spain. He observes that among Scandinavian rock-sculptures
there are no spirals; that certain designs&mdash;for example the boat&mdash;are
common to sepulchral monuments in Brittany and in Ireland; that there
are striking points of resemblance between the bronze culture of Ireland and
Spain; and that designs which have been found in the East Riding of Yorkshire
represent Aegean types which also appear in the departments of the Marne
and the Gard (see p. 200, <i>infra</i>). These arguments seem unavailing against those
stated in the text, and especially against the almost complete absence of the
spiral from Spain, Gaul, and Southern England. If the figure does not appear
on Scandinavian rocks, it abounds on Scandinavian weapons and ornaments;
and on rocks boats are frequently represented (O. Montelius, <cite>Civilisation of
Sweden in Heathen Times</cite>, 1888, pp. 46, 73-6). Nor is M. Reinach’s reasoning
sound when he goes on to argue that we have no right to trace the Bronze Age
spiral of Western Europe to an Egyptian source because the same design has
been found engraved on mammoths’ tusks in the Pyrenaean cave of Espélungues
at Arudy (<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>, xv, 1904, p. 146, fig. 24; xvi, 1905, p. 5, fig. 4).
As Dr. Arthur Evans remarks (<cite>Report of ... the Brit. Association</cite>, 1896, p. 913),
‘the earliest cultural strata of Europe, from the Neolithic period onwards,
betray an entire absence of the recurring spiral motive. When we find it
later propagating itself as a definite ornamental system in a regular chronological
succession throughout an otherwise inter-related European zone, we
have every right to trace it to a common source.</p></div>

Coffey (<cite>Journ. Roy. Soc. Ant. Ireland</cite>, 5th ser., vi, 1896, p. 40), remarking that
Britain and Gaul were on a lower plane of civilization in the Bronze Age than
Scandinavia, argues that one cause may have been that ‘the sea-way south
of the Elbe was possibly closed to Scandinavian enterprise in the Bronze Age’.
But the North Sea was not; and apparently there was nothing to prevent
Scandinavian traders from landing on our eastern coasts if they had thought
it worth while.</p></div>

Pitt-Rivers (<cite>Excavations in Cranborne Chase</cite>, iv, 145) suggests that the common
form of disk barrows ‘may have arisen through a failure to carry out the original
intention’. ‘The first idea,’ he continues, ‘of the mourners ... may probably
have been to erect a large monument ... and the ditch in such a case would
contain a large area. In the course of a few days, however, the grief may
have abated, and laziness supervened, in which case the arrested tumulus
would assume the form described. The habit of all primitive peoples ... of
lashing themselves up into a frenzy on the occasion of a death, and general
excitability upon any uncommon occurrence, followed by a speedy relapse,
favours this hypothesis. When, however, a vallum is seen to follow the line
of the ditch, this cause cannot be assigned to the particular structure. It
may, however, be a form that has become persistent and conventionalized
through the cause already mentioned.’ This ingenious theory seems to imply
that the motive of laziness only began to operate when disk barrows came
into fashion.</p>

<p>The few disk barrows of Derbyshire have no apparent ditches (<cite>Vict. Hist. of ... Derby</cite>,
i, 169). That county also contains barrows constructed differently
and of different materials from those which undoubtedly belong to the Bronze
Age: their date is uncertain, but may be Romano-British (<i>ib.</i>, pp. 186-9;
<cite>Proc. Soc. Ant.</cite>, 2nd ser., xv, 1893-5, p. 427).</p>

<p>Mr. G. F. Tregelles (<cite>Vict. Hist. of ... Cornwall</cite>, i, 358) thinks that in Cornwall
the distinctions between conical, bowl, bell, flat, and ring barrows ‘may be
little more than differences in height’.</p></div>

a cairn near Crinan in Argyllshire, surrounded by ‘a double circle of stones’,
which ‘stood from 3 feet to 5 feet apart, except for a space ... where, in both
circles, four stones were found placed close together’, says, ‘This is not an
unusual feature in circles which enclose burials; in fact it is, in one shape or
another, almost universal.... The object seems to be to make the circle incomplete.... When
the circle is made of stones placed close together, or is formed
of earth, then one or more openings occur in it.’ On the other hand, Mr. W. C.
Borlase (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, xlix, 1885, p. 183) found that in Cornwall the stone
rings enclosing barrows were almost always continuous.</p></div>

See J. Anderson, <cite>Scotland in Pagan Times,&mdash;the Bronze and Stone Ages</cite>,
pp. 169-70. Canon Greenwell (<cite>Brit. Barrows</cite>, pp. 48-50) asserts that knife-daggers
and flat axes&mdash;the only bronze implements found in Yorkshire barrows&mdash;never
accompany swords and spear-heads in hoards, and argues that this
proves the early date of round barrows in general. If the assertion were true,
the fact would prove the early date of those Yorkshire barrows in which daggers
and flat axes were found; but the question is whether many other barrows
do not belong to later periods of the Bronze Age. Moreover, flat axes have
been found twice in hoards,&mdash;one with palstaves (J. Evans, <cite>Anc. Bronze Implements</cite>,
p. 464), another with swords (<i>ib.</i>, p. 466).</p></div>

The Hon. John Abercromby (<cite>Journ. Anthr. Inst.</cite>, xxxv, 1905, p. 262)
affirms that ‘the few bronze swords, spear-heads, etc., of the Bronze Age
and Hallstatt Period, that first filtered in driblets into this country, and were
then reproduced with variations by native smiths, were too precious to be
laid by for ever in a grave, even at the end of the Bronze Age in Britain’.
Is not this begging the question? If small bronze weapons were ‘laid by for
ever’ in graves in the earlier period, when bronze was scarce, why should not
large ones have been laid by when it was common? And if gold ornaments were
not too costly to be sacrificed, why should bronze swords have been deemed
so precious?</p></div>

type and to certain blades found in the Wiltshire barrows, which (see pp. 145, 147,

daggers’, remarks that ‘at the period to which they belong the art of making
cores must have been known, as the ferrule found at Arreton Down will testify’.

<p>Mr. C. H. Read (<cite>Guide to the Ant. of the Bronze Age</cite>, p. 24) observes that
cinerary urns ‘possibly represent the period during which swords and spear-heads

certain urns of overhanging rim type were contemporary with socketed
weapons (<cite>Journ. Anthr. Inst.</cite>, xxxv, 1905, pp. 262-4); but the oldest urns
were much earlier. Cf. <cite>Proc. Soc. Ant.</cite>, 2nd ser., xviii, 1899-1901, pp. 251-3.</p></div>

Flat bronze celts were found by Canon Greenwell in two only of the multitudes
of barrows which he has explored not only in the northern counties but
also in Wiltshire and Berkshire (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, lii, 1890, p. 3); while Mr. J. R.
Mortimer (<cite>Forty Years’ Researches</cite>, p. xlvi) never found one with any of the
893 interments which he examined on the Yorkshire Wolds. The canon
opened four Late Celtic barrows in the parish of Cowlam, of which he says
(<cite>Brit. Barrows</cite>, p. 212), ‘Had the bodies occurred without the necklace, fibula,
or armlets, I should not have hesitated the least about classing these four
barrows with the other barrows in the immediate vicinity, which were of the
time of stone, or more probably of bronze.’ Is it unreasonable to conclude
that a few other barrows which contain no relics of the late Bronze Age may
nevertheless belong to that time?</p></div>

<p>Mr. John Ward (<cite>Vict. Hist. of ... Derby</cite>, i, 177-8) shows from an examination

in which interments of both kinds are found cremation was, generally speaking,
later than inhumation. This conclusion is supported by the fact that in
Wiltshire, where cremation on the whole greatly predominates, it occurs only
about as often as inhumation in bowl and bell barrows (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, xliii,
1871, p. 293).</p></div>

<p>Mr. J. P. Gibson, in a paper on a recent find of drinking-cups in Dilston
Park, Northumberland (<cite>Archaeol. Aeliana</cite>, 3rd ser., ii, 1906, pp. 126-49) says
(pp. 146-7), ‘There appears nothing in the Dilston Park discovery to confirm
this suggested [chronological] arrangement. Mr. Abercromby tells me that
evidence received since the paper [in <cite>Proc. Soc. Ant.</cite>, xxxviii, 1904] was published
has convinced him that “the whole question requires a fresh investigation” ... The
Dilston Park find ... furnishes two instances in which
in the same cist ... vessels are found varying widely both in form and decoration.
It also proves the great difficulty of attempting to fix any relative
dates of Bronze Age beakers by a comparison either of their shape or ornament.’
Mr. Abercromby, however, in his third paper (<i>ib.</i>, xxxix, 1905), adheres to
his chronological arrangement. See also <i>ib.</i>, xl, 1906, pp. 32-3, 371.</p>

<p>Handles are occasionally found not only on drinking-cups, but also on the
other kinds of sepulchral pottery.</p></div>

and map facing p. 396; <cite>Proc. Soc. Ant. Scot.</cite>, xxxviii, 1904, p. 329). Their
rarity in South-Eastern Britain is doubtless due largely to the destruction of
barrows in a highly cultivated region; while their absence from many of the
Midland counties may be ascribed partly to the same cause and partly to the
fact that the population of those parts in the Bronze Age was probably small.
In Cornwall vessels of a peculiar kind appear to have served the same purposes
as drinking-cups and food-vessels (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, xlix, 1885, pp. 186-8). From
the frequency with which drinking-cups occur in the east of Scotland it may
perhaps be inferred that they were introduced into that country, at least in
part, by immigrants from Scandinavia or Denmark.</p>

<p>A gold cup, which in form resembles certain drinking-cups and is ornamented
on the bottom with concentric circles, has been found with a bronze dagger
at Rillaton in Cornwall (<cite>Archaeol. Journal</cite>, xxiv, 1867, p. 189).</p></div>

Years’ Researches</cite>, pp. lxvi-lxvii) says, ‘If food was essential [to the dead],
so would liquid be ... and I do not know of an instance of the remains of
animal matter having ever been found in any vase of the true drinking-cup
type. That they served the purpose of holding liquid, there can be little doubt’.
Mr. Mortimer is more logical than the people of the Bronze Age. His argument
would lead to the conclusion that only food or only drink was considered
necessary for the dead according as food-vessels or drinking-cups were placed
with them. Very likely liquid was sometimes poured into drinking-cups: but
for obvious reasons evidence is wanting; whereas evidence exists that they
sometimes held food. By ‘the true drinking-cup type’ Mr. Mortimer apparently
means the low-brimmed type which Thurnam called γ (see W. Greenwell,
<cite>Brit. Barrows</cite>, p. 95, fig. 82), and which, as we have seen, is confined to Northern
Britain; but he is alone in calling this type ‘true’ to the exclusion of the
others.</p></div>

<i>Ib.</i>, pp. 218-34. ‘General resemblance of ornamental patterns.’ says Pitt-Rivers
(<i>ib.</i>, p. 216), ‘is not enough to prove that they were copied from one
another ... when, however, the points of resemblance are very minute, and
the distribution limited and continuous, it may be fairly argued that the
different kinds of earthworks in which they are found, in the same district,
were of the same period’. Mr. Andrew Lang’s remarks on decorative motives
(<cite>Custom and Myth</cite>, 1885, pp. 286-9) contain much, but not the whole truth.
‘The conviction becomes irresistible,’ he writes, ‘that all these objects, in
shape, in purpose, in character of decoration, are the same, because the mind
and the materials of men, in their early stages of civilisation especially, are
the same everywhere. You might introduce old Greek bits of clay-work,
figures or vases, into a Peruvian collection, or might foist Mexican objects
among the clay treasures of Hissarlik, and the wisest archaeologist would be
deceived.’ A socketed celt, almost identical in form with some Italian celts
and ornamented with the chevron, has been found in Chili (J. Evans, <cite>Anc.
Bronze Implements</cite>, p. 145).</p></div>

A. Pitt-Rivers, <cite>Excavations in Cranborne Chase</cite>, iv, 238-9. Mr. Coffey
(<cite>Journ. Roy. Soc. Ant. Ireland</cite>, 5th ser., v, 1895, p. 195) thinks that ‘herring-bone,
chevron, and triangle ornament’ may be native in Europe, and (<i>ib.</i>, vi,
1896, p. 42) that lozenge, chequer, and saltire patterns ‘may be original in
Britain’. He holds, however (<i>ib.</i>), that ‘we have no reason to believe that
geometrical forms have ever been spontaneously invented’, and adds that
‘they appear to have been invariably derived by a process of conventionalisation
from realistic prototypes’: he cites examples (<i>ib.</i>, iv, 1894, pp. 364-6) from
the pottery of Cyprus to show how ‘the body of the lotus flower is simplified
to a triangular form, and the central sepal to an enlarged lozenge, enriched
by cross-hatching and chequer patterns’; and he argues (<i>ib.</i>, v, 1895, pp. 210-1)
that ‘the occurrence of chequers of lozenges on Early Bronze Age remains
from Scotland, in some instances identical with Cyprian forms, and the close
association of lozenge, chequer, and × [saltire] patterns with the spiral in the
Bronze Age ornament of Ireland is ... strong evidence that lozenge and
chequer patterns travelled northward across Europe on the path of the spiral’.</p>

<p>That geometrical forms were in certain cases derived from ‘realistic prototypes’
may be granted, but does not exclude the possibility that in others
the same forms were ‘spontaneously invented’. Moreover, certain geometrical
forms occur, as we have seen (pp. 197-8), on neolithic and even on palaeolithic
objects, to which they could not have found their way by the route and from
the source to which Mr. Coffey refers. Others again are of such a kind that it
is difficult to conceive of any ‘realistic prototype’ from which they could have
been derived; and there are lozenge, chequer, and saltire patterns on pottery
of the Bronze Age in parts of England to which, according to Mr. Coffey, the
spiral did not penetrate until the Bronze Age was at an end. Mr. Coffey
(<i>ib.</i>, iv, 1894, p. 356) is himself disposed to except ‘some zigzag, chevron,
and triangle ornaments’ from the list of geometric patterns which, as he
insists, ‘have been invariably derived from naturalistic forms’; but the
truth is that, as Mr. Romilly Allen has shown (<cite>Celtic Art in Pagan and Christian
Times</cite>, pp. 27-37), all the patterns of the Bronze Age, except spirals, circles
and other curves, and mere dots, punch marks, and straight lines, are simply
combinations of diagonal straight lines based upon the chevron.</p>

<p>Another theory of Mr. Coffey’s (<cite>op. cit.</cite>, v, 1895, p. 202) is that ‘as far as
the ornament of primitive peoples has been studied, it appears to be generally
associated with religious ideas’, and that the ‘naturalistic objects’ to the
conventionalization of which he would trace the geometric patterns of the
Bronze Age had ‘a religious and talismanic meaning’. I am not concerned
to deny that certain geometric patterns, for instance the swastika and the
circle, may sometimes have had such a meaning; but Mr. Coffey’s theory is
too sweeping. It would be difficult to prove that oblong punch-marks or
impressions of finger-nails and finger-tips, or the herring-bone pattern were
connected with religion. [See A. Lang, <cite>Magic and Religion</cite>, 1901, p. 248.]</p></div>

I do not mean to suggest that all stone circles were derived from peristaliths;
but I do not think that we should be justified in differentiating from the
peristaliths by a hard and fast line those larger circles in which no traces of
interment have been found. Mr. John Ward (<cite>Vict. Hist. of ... Derby</cite>, i, 169),
remarking that most of the round barrows, or rather cairns, of Derbyshire
consist merely of stones ‘thrown together anyhow’, says that ‘a slight
advance is the introduction of a kerb of larger stones laid upon the ground
to confine the proposed mound’; and he goes on to observe that in those
cases in which the stones of the mound itself have been removed, the kerb
‘may remain as a ring of stones easily mistaken for a circle’. He evidently
believes that the kerb was merely a structural improvement. Perhaps in
Derbyshire, though even this is not certain. The object of the stone rings
which have been found within cairns, and of those which stood upon barrows
in Northern Germany, was certainly not utilitarian; and the kerb may have
had a religious or mystical meaning. Nor is there any evidence that it was
an ‘advance’ upon the structureless cairn.</p></div>

Scot.</cite>, xxxiv, 1900, p. 196. Mr. A. L. Lewis, the principal advocate of the
solar temple theory, seems to be satisfied with almost any kind of orientation.
Thus he tells us that of twenty-one circles which he observed in Southern
Britain nineteen ‘had a special reference to the north-east’, that is to the
midsummer sunrise: but he maintains that a ‘line due east through the
Stannon and Fernacre circles to Brown Willy evidently was meant to indicate
the equinoctial sunrise’; and in another case he insists that the object pointed
at was the pole star.</p>

<p>Mr. G. F. Tregelles (<cite>Vict. Hist. of ... Cornwall</cite>, i, 404-5), after making careful
investigations with his compass in Cornwall, has arrived at results ‘mainly
negative’, and concludes that ‘there is not apparently such evidence of orientation
as would satisfy a critical observer’.</p>

<p>Mr. W. C. Lukis, on the other hand (<cite>Prehist. Stone Monuments of the Brit.
Isles,&mdash;Cornwall</cite>, p. vi), remarking that circles sometimes occur in groups, asks,
‘if they were temples ... why should the worshippers have been divided into
so many different congregations?’ As it is not contended that all circles
were solar temples, this argument would obviously apply only to those particular
instances; and even with this limitation it is inconclusive. Each circle
was probably erected in honour of some one chieftain; and it remains
possible that sun-worship may have been practised by his clan. We can
hardly suppose that the erection of circles was supervised by a central hierarchy
who aimed at economizing labour! See p. 479, <i>infra</i>.</p></div>

Mr. G. F. Tregelles (<cite>Vict. Hist. of ... Cornwall</cite>, i, 404) remarks that ‘the
principal English [as distinguished from most Cumbrian and Scottish] circles
have never been proved to be’ sepulchral; but neither have they been proved
to be non-sepulchral. It is said (<cite>Proc. Soc. Ant.</cite>, 2nd ser., xix, 1902, p. 98) that
the circle of Sunken Kirk in Westmorland has been subjected to a ‘searching
exploration’. Was the whole area excavated? Pitt-Rivers (<cite>Excavations in
Cranborne Chase</cite>, iv, 148), speaking of the fifty two secondary interments
which he discovered just outside a barrow at Rushmore (see p. 178, <i>supra</i>) says,
‘They showed no trace whatever on the surface ... and would never have
been discovered had it not been for the practice I have established of trenching
down to the undisturbed chalk the entire surface of the ground contained
within the area of the contoured plan of the Barrow’.</p>

<p>Mr. R. Burnard (<cite>Vict. Hist. of ... Devon</cite>, i, 359-60) observes that ‘fires
seem to have been kindled all over the [Fernworthy] circle, for every scoop
of the pick and shovel ... displayed charcoal’, and, remarking that this
monument is the ‘predominant feature of a group of sepulchral remains’,
conjectures that it was ‘the crematorium or the site of the funeral feasts
or both’.</p></div>

Plutarch (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De placitis philosophorum</cite>, iii, 17, § 2), who evidently knew
nothing about the tides, ascribed to Pytheas the absurd statement that high
tide occurs at full moon, and low tide at new moon (Πυθέας ὁ Μασσαλιώτης τῇ
πληρώσει τῆς σελήνης τὰς πλημμύρας γίνεσθαι, τῇ δὲ μειώσει τὰς ἀμπώτιδας), a blunder
which, as Müllenhoff (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche Altertumskunde</cite>, i, 1890, p. 365) remarks, nobody
could have made who had spent twenty-four hours on the Atlantic coast.
I agree with him that Pytheas had anticipated the discovery of Posidonius
(Strabo, iii, 5, § 8), which, needless to say, must have been made long before
by Phoenician mariners, but that he was unfortunate in his reporter. Cf. H. F.

(<cite>Geogr. Journal</cite>, i, 1893, p. 516) holds that Pytheas sailed from Uxisama to
Kent, ‘because he reported that the coast of Gaul, where he left it, was some
days’ sail from Cantion’. But what he reported was simply that Cantium
was some days’ sail from Gaul (καὶ τὸ Κάντιον ἡμερῶν τινων πλοῦν ἀπέχειν τῆς

based upon his homeward voyage. Professor Ridgeway (<cite>Folk-Lore</cite>, i, 1890,

Brittany to the Isle of Wight. Müllenhoff gives satisfactory reasons for the

Strabo (ii, 4, § 1) seems to imply that Pytheas avowed that he described
Thule from hearsay. He tells us on the authority of Polybius that Pytheas
wrote an account of τὰ περὶ τῆς Θούλης καὶ τῶν τόπων ἐκείνων, ἐν οἷς οὔτε γῆ καθ’
αὑτὴν ὑπῆρχεν ἔτι οὔτε θάλαττα, οὔτ’ ἀήρ, ἀλλὰ σύγκριμά τι ἐκ τούτων πλεύμονι

<p><a id="Footnote_960" href="#FNanchor_960" class="label">960</a>
My view coincides, in regard to the identification of Thule, with that of
G. Hergt (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Nordlandfahrt des Pytheas</cite>, 1894), and also with that of M. Camille
Jullian (<cite>Journ. des Savants</cite>, 1905, pp. 95, n. 1, 101, n. 2). Hergt’s work is not
in the British Museum, and I have not been able to procure a copy; but his
conclusions are summarized in <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahresberichte der Geschichtswissenschaft</cite>, 1895,
iii, 167. He and M. Jullian (<cite>op. cit.</cite>, p. 101) hold that Pytheas landed in
Norway, and that the Norwegians with whom he conversed pointed out to
him in the distance ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le lieu mystérieux où le soleil repose durant les longues
nuits du cercle polaire</span>’. On this theory I cannot conceive how Pytheas came
to regard Thule as one of the British Isles.</p>

<p>Müllenhoff, who identifies Thule with Mainland, argues, first (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche
Altertumskunde</cite>, i, 1890, pp. 387-8) that Pytheas would hardly have succeeded
in sailing to Norway in six days on account of difficulties, which he points
out, in navigation; secondly (p. 393), that Pytheas, who distinguished between
the Celtic and the Germanic populations of Northern Europe and must have
been accompanied by an interpreter, would not have confounded Norway&mdash;a
non-Celtic country&mdash;with Thule; thirdly (pp. 398-9), that agriculture was
introduced into Norway by the Germans, that Pytheas, in his description of
Britain and of Thule, did not say that corn was not cultivated there, and that,
if he had visited Norway, he would have mentioned the Lapps and the
reindeer; and lastly (pp. 399-400), that the place where ‘the barbarians’
showed him ‘the sleeping-place of the sun’ was evidently the most northerly
land which he reached, and was not in the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>Every one of these arguments rests upon the assumption that Pytheas
visited Thule, for which, as we have seen, there is no evidence. Neither is there
any that Thule was inhabited by a Celtic-speaking people: it is, as we have
seen (p. 152, n. 2), absolutely certain that corn was cultivated in Scandinavia
in the Bronze Age; and even if Pytheas did visit Thule, there is no reason to
suppose that he went sufficiently far northward to come in contact with Lapps.</p>

<p>Mr. Tozer (<cite>Hist. of Anc. Geogr.</cite>, pp. 159-60), who does not believe that
Pytheas travelled further northward than ‘the extremity of Britain’, nevertheless
holds with Müllenhoff that Thule was Mainland. He points out that
‘the sleeping-place of the sun’, which he of course locates in Thule, was in
the Arctic Circle. ‘This of course,’ he continues, ‘would not apply to
Shetland ... but on such a question the report of “barbarians” could hardly
be expected to be accurate.’ Is not this a weak argument for identifying
Thule with Mainland, where, even at the winter solstice, the sun is above
the horizon five hours out of the twenty-four? The ‘barbarians’ had not
themselves penetrated within the Arctic Circle; and that darkness was anywhere
continuous for twenty-four hours would not have occurred to them
if they had not learned the fact from Scandinavian sailors who had seen the
phenomenon or had been informed of it by eye-witnesses. Moreover, Pytheas,
who so accurately determined the latitude of Massilia, would hardly have
allowed himself to be persuaded that Mainland was on the Arctic Circle.</p></div>

Mr. Romilly Allen (<cite>Archaeol. Cambr.</cite>, 5th ser., xiii, 1896, p. 223) argues
from the fewness of the known Late Celtic burials that the period between the
introduction of iron and the Roman conquest ‘cannot have been very long’.
So also thought Canon Greenwell (<cite>Brit. Barrows</cite>, p. 212), apparently forgetting
what he had very judiciously said on p. 50. The argument would lead to the
conclusion that in Scotland the Late Celtic Period was almost non-existent;
for only one interment of the Early Iron Age has been found there (p. 435, <i>infra</i>).
Many such interments, unmarked by any tumulus, have doubtless escaped
notice; and in many French departments they are unknown (<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>, xiv,
1903, p. 386; <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rev. de l’École d’anthr.</cite>, xv, 1905, pp. 218-26).</p></div>

Sir J. Evans (<cite>Coins of the Anc. Britons</cite>, p. 39) remarks that, according to
Ptolemy (<cite>Geogr.</cite>, ii, 3, § 13), the territory of the Belgae included Ischalis
(Ilchester), Aquae Calidae (Bath), and Venta (Winchester), and must therefore
have comprised nearly all the area corresponding with Hampshire, Wiltshire,
and Somersetshire; but that in each of these counties we find a distinct
coinage. Probably, he argues, when the inscribed coins of Somersetshire were
struck, the Belgae only occupied the east of Hampshire and the west of Sussex.
Without disputing this conclusion, I would suggest that since no one Gallic
tribe was called the Belgae, the British Belgae, in the narrower sense of the
term, may have been a loose confederation or aggregate of tribes or of <i>pagi</i>,
each of which perhaps had its own coinage.</p>

<p>All scholars are, however, aware that it is generally impossible to determine
the frontiers of the British tribes, even for the period of the Roman conquest,
with any approach to the comparative accuracy which has been attained in
the case of those of Gaul (see my <cite>Caesar’s Conquest of Gaul</cite>, 1899, pp. 330-2).
The delimitation of the tribal areas of independent Gaul depends mainly upon
the reasonable assumption that they correspond for the most part exactly
or nearly with those of the Gallo-Roman cantons (<i>civitates</i>). But in Britain
we are not only baffled by the political changes which took place in the restless
century that intervened between the invasions of Caesar and the Claudian
conquest: we also find that although a recently discovered inscription (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>,
lix, 1904, pp. 121-2) has shown that at all events in the case of the
Ordovices the cantonal organization was preserved or adopted by the Roman
Empire, yet, as Mommsen says (<cite>Provinces</cite>, i, 191 [<cite>Röm. Gesch.</cite>, v, 1885, p. 174]),
‘the Britannic tribes, taken in the strict sense, [apparently] disappear as soon
as they fall under Roman rule, and of the individual cantons after their annexation
there is virtually no mention at all.’ Moreover, the boundaries of the
Gallo-Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">civitates</i> served, in principle, to define the areas of episcopal
jurisdiction; and the areas of the Gallic dioceses are known. In Britain this
source of information is wanting.</p></div>

See <cite>Guide to the Ant. of the Early Iron Age</cite> (Brit. Museum), pp. 83, 98, and
p. 240, <i>infra</i>. It has been pointed out (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, lii, 1890, pp. 385-7) that
the interments by inhumation which have been discovered at Arras in the
East Riding of Yorkshire correspond with the Gallic interments of the fourth
century before Christ. Since the Belgae appear to have practised cremation,
these interments very likely indicate, what we know already, that there was
a pre-Belgic Brythonic invasion of Britain: but it does not follow that they
were contemporary with those of Gaul, and belonged to the time that immediately
followed the close of the British Bronze Age; for, as we shall see (p. 286),
inhumation persisted in Britain long after it had become obsolete on the other
side of the Channel.</p></div>

Ancient ‘corduroy’ roads, made of ‘cross timbers laid side by side on three
lines of supporting logs parallel to the direction of the road’, have been discovered
near Gilpin Bridge in Cumberland (<cite>Trans. Cumberland and Westmorland
Ant. and Archaeol. Soc.</cite>, N. S., iv, 1904, pp. 207-10); but their date cannot
yet be fixed. It has been said that trackways were made (1) by digging two
parallel ditches and throwing up the earth so as to form a bank between them,
and (2) by digging one ditch and building the bank on one or on both sides.

See p. 267, <i>infra</i>. Caesar’s statement, that the Britons imported copper
or bronze (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aere utuntur importato</i> [<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, v, 12, § 4]), has always been a puzzle.
I doubt whether any scholar would now infer from it that the cakes of copper
which have been found in bronze-founders’ hoards were of foreign origin;
but it has been suggested (<cite>Guide to the Ant. of the Early Iron Age</cite> [Brit. Museum],
p. 86) that Caesar may have referred to articles of foreign manufacture such
as the bronze flagon mentioned on p. 246, <i>supra</i>. See also J. Evans, <cite>Anc.
Bronze Implements</cite>, p. 419.</p>

<p>M. S. Reinach (<cite>Rev. celt.</cite>, xxi, 1900, p. 173) infers from Caesar’s observation
that ‘the industrial activity to which the relics of the Bronze Age testify had
long ceased’, and that there was an arrest, or rather a recoil of civilization.
But, as we shall see hereafter (p. 267), the culture of the Bronze Age persisted
in certain parts of Britain until the Roman conquest. Were the bronze implements
that were used in those parts imported? If so, how could they have
been paid for without industrial activity; and what conceivable reason can
be suggested for the assumed paralysis? The industrial activity of the Early
Iron Age in Britain is unquestionable; and I doubt whether any theory could be
framed to account for a cessation, contemporaneous with the manufacture of
iron, of the trade of the bronze-founder.</p></div>

<i>Ib.</i>, xxxiii, 1899, pp. 15, 20-3, 26-32; xxxiv, 1900, p. 74. A similar
method of fortification was practised by the Dacians (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Congrès archéol. de
France</cite>, 1874 <a id="FNanchor_1876" href="#Footnote_1876" class="fnanchor">1876</a>, p. 444), ‘in the Danne-werk at Korborg, near Schleswig’

<p>The well-known camp on Herefordshire Beacon is interesting because, like
Old Sarum (Sorbiodunum), it contains a citadel. Though it is locally described
as a ‘British camp’, its date is at present uncertain. While most of the
objects which have been found in it are comparatively late, Pitt-Rivers (<cite>Journ.
Anthr. Inst.</cite>, x, 1881, p. 331) pointed out that the pottery seemed to indicate
its Celtic origin; but the citadel presents a difficulty. Was it a later addition?
See also F. J. Haverfield, <cite>Archaeol. Survey of Herefordshire</cite>, 1896, pp. 3-4.</p>

<p>The ‘vitrified’ stone forts of the British Isles demand a brief notice. There
are none in England, but many in the northern and western counties of Scotland
and some in France. It is very doubtful whether any exist in Wales or Ireland
(<cite>Archaeol. Journal</cite>, xxxvii, 1880, pp. 227, 234; D. Christison, <cite>Early Fortifications
in Scotland</cite>, pp. 187, 190). The question is whether the vitrifaction,
which was due to fire, was accidental or designed; and in some cases the only
way of settling this is to ascertain by excavation the extent of the vitrifaction
(<i>ib.</i>, p. 192). The best authorities have concluded that when the vitrified part
of the fort is small the phenomenon may be safely ascribed to accident,&mdash;perhaps
to a beacon fire; but that when it may be traced almost all round the
rampart it was intentional (<i>ib.</i>, pp. 186-7; <cite>Archaeol. Journal</cite>, xxxvii, 1880,
pp. 240-1; R. Munro, <cite>Prehist. Scotland</cite>, pp. 382-3). Probably the builders
intended to give cohesion to the walls and make it impossible for assailants
to demolish them (<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>, xiv, 1903, pp. 330-1); or when the vitrifaction
was confined to the upper surface the defenders would have secured firm
foothold while the assailants would have stumbled over loose stones (D. Christison,
<cite>op. cit.</cite>, pp, 186-7). [See Addenda]</p></div>

<p>Professor T. McKenny Hughes (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, liii, 1892, p. 484) suggests
that Offa’s Dyke may have ‘belonged to the defensive system of the Britons’.
All we know is that those dykes which have been excavated&mdash;Bokerly Dyke
and Wansdyke&mdash;were Roman or post-Roman (A. Pitt-Rivers, <cite>Excavations
in Cranborne Chase</cite>, iii, p. xiii); and it is in the last degree improbable that earthworks
which extend over territory that belonged to several tribes should have
been constructed at a time when tribes only combined for brief periods and
in the presence of urgent and common peril. Cf. F. J. Haverfield, <cite>Archaeol.

Roman occupation (see <cite>Vict. Hist. of ... Cornwall</cite>, i, 367-9). The ‘hut-clusters’
of Cornwall, of which Chrysoister is a good example (W. C. Lukis, <cite>Prehist.

Munro, <cite>The Lake-Dwellings of Europe</cite>, pp. 454, 459, 461, 475, 493. Dr. Munro
(<i>ib.</i>, pp. 490-2) observes that ‘in the early centuries of the Christian era the
distribution of crannogs in Scotland and Ireland closely coincides with a well-defined
area in which the Celtic language was spoken’, though he admits that
‘they have not been found in the south-eastern provinces of Scotland’. ‘In
this wider area’ [including Southern Britain], he continues, ‘on the supposition
that the Celts were the introducers or founders of the system, we ought to find
some vestiges of these dwellings.... This is precisely what the general researches
into British lake-dwellings have shown in the stray remnants of them that
have been found in Llangorse, Holderness, the <i>meres</i> of Norfolk and Suffolk, Cold
Ash Common, etc. All these, with perhaps the exception of the pile-structures
at London Wall, appear to be older than the majority of the crannogs of
Scotland and Ireland.... Taking all these facts into account ... I am inclined
to believe that we have here evidence of a widely distributed custom which
underlies the subsequent [to Caesar] great development which the lake-dwellings
assumed in Scotland and Ireland. Moreover, I believe it probable that the
early Celts had got this knowledge from contact with the inhabitants of the
pile-dwellings of Central Europe.’</p>

<p>Llangorse is the only Welsh site at which a lake-dwelling has been found
(<i>ib.</i>, p. 464). I venture to ask the doctor why lake-dwellings are so rare in
England and Wales, where, on his theory, they ought to abound; why the
Scottish and Irish Celts did not apply their ‘knowledge’ for some centuries
after they reached the British Isles; and why lake-dwellings are non-existent
(<i>ib.</i>, p. 493) in Spain and Portugal, where Celts were numerous (G. Dottin,
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Manuel pour servir à l’étude de l’ant. celt.</cite>, pp. 324, 329-31, 349)? And, seeing
that there are pile-dwellings in New Guinea and Central Africa, is it not conceivable
that those of the British Isles had no connexion with Central Europe?</p></div>

May the rarity of British iron weapons be partly accounted for by supposing
that during the greater part of the Late Celtic Period swords and spear-heads
were still in many cases made of bronze? In the Homeric Age implements
were of iron, but the weapons which the poet mentions were all of bronze,
doubtless because the armourers had not yet learned to temper iron (<cite>Rev.
arch.</cite>, 4<sup>e</sup> sér., vii, 1906, pp. 284, 290-1, 294).</p></div>

<p>I hardly know whether it is worth while to notice the statements of Diodorus
(v, 32, § 3) and Strabo (iv, 5, § 4) in regard to the prevalence of cannibalism
in certain parts of the British Isles. If there is any truth in them, the cannibals
had doubtless inherited the custom from neolithic times (p. 113, <i>supra</i>). Strabo’s
remark, which, as he himself warns us, does not rest upon good authority,
refers only to Ireland. Diodorus says that some of the Britons were cannibals;
but this observation may also refer to the Irish. A mound-dwelling near
Kirkwall (<cite>Archaeol. Journal</cite>, x, 1853, p. 217) is said to have contained broken
human bones mingled with those of sheep, which may or may not be evidence
of cannibalism; and every scholar knows the speech that Caesar puts into
the mouth of Critognatus, one of the Arvernian chiefs who was blockaded in
Alesia (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, vii, 77, § 12). As for the unnatural vices with which Diodorus
(v, 32, § 7), Strabo (iv, 4, § 6), and others charge the Celts, they are rife among
the civilized nations of modern Europe.</p></div>

Caesar does not say that Mercury was actually the supreme deity of the
Gauls, but only the most fervently worshipped: he expressly says that they
regarded their Jupiter as the lord of the celestials. ‘It must not be supposed,’
says Sir Alfred Lyall (<cite>Asiatic Studies</cite>, i, 1899, p. 121), ‘that even the uppermost
gods of Hinduism have retired behind mere ceremonial altars, like constitutional
monarchs.... But there seem to be many grades of accessibility among
them, from Brahma&mdash;who, since he created the world, has taken no further
trouble about it, and is naturally rewarded by possessing only one or two
of the million temples to Hindu gods,’ &amp;c.</p></div>

M. Camille Jullian (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rev. des études anc.</cite>, iv, 1902, p. 109, n. 1) points out
that in vol. vii [p. 331] of the <cite>Corpus inscr. Lat.</cite> there are sixty-one inscriptions
in honour of Mars [of which, however, eight are uncertain], and only eight in
honour of Mercury; and the greater popularity of Mars is also apparent in the
supplements published in <cite>Ephemeris epigraphica</cite> (iii, 1877, pp. 125, 128; iv,
1881, p. 196; vii, 1892, pp. 289, 299, 313, 324, 332, 334, 352). But no account
should be taken of those inscriptions in which the name of Mars is not coupled
with that of a Celtic deity, though even with this reservation the ascendancy
of Mars remains unaffected.</p></div>

There is no trace of the worship of Esus in the British Isles, unless M. d’Arbois
de Jubainville (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Celtes</cite>, p. 63) is right in thinking that Esus was a god whose
surname was Smertullos, and that Smertullos, the Celtic Pollux, is to be
identified with the Irish Cuchulainn (see also <cite>Fragm. hist. Graec.</cite>, ed. Didot,
i, 1841, p. 194, fr. 6; Diodorus Siculus, iv, 56, § 4; <cite>Corpus inscr. Lat.</cite>, xiii,
3026 <i>c</i>; and H. d’A. de Jubainville, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Principaux auteurs à consulter sur l’hist. des
Celtes</cite>, p. 88). Esus is depicted as a woodman in the act of felling a tree on
No. 2 of four altars which were discovered at Paris in 1710; while Smertullos
appears on the right of No. 3, threatening a serpent with a club. M. d’Arbois
is a little rash in concluding (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La civilisation des Celtes</cite>, 1899, p. 173) that because
there was a Briton called Esunectus, who may have been an immigrant from
Gaul, Esus was worshipped in Britain. The name AESV occurs on a coin of
the Iceni; but its meaning is uncertain (J. Evans, <cite>Coins of the Anc. Britons</cite>,
p. 386). The scholiasts of Lucan identified Esus with Mercury; but their
authority on such a matter is worthless (see <cite>Rev. celt.</cite>, xviii, 1897, p. 117).
Prof. Rhys, however, has recently examined an inscription (<cite>Celtic Inscr. in
France and Italy</cite>, 1907, p. 56), which leads him to give a qualified support to
the identification.</p></div>

Prof. Rhys (<cite>Celtic Heathendom</cite>, p. 126) says that ‘most of the remains of
antiquity connected with his temple make him a sort of Jupiter’, but adds
(<i>ib.</i>, p. 130) that he ‘was not simply a Neptune ... he was also a Mars, as the
inscriptions at Lydney testify’. But the testimony of the inscriptions (<cite>Corpus
inscr. Lat.</cite>, vii, 138-40) consists simply in the letter M; and Hübner, to whom
the professor appeals, queries his own suggestion that M stands for <i>Marti.</i>
[I learn from one of Mr. A. B. Cook’s articles in <cite>Folk-Lore</cite> (xvii, 1906, p. 39, n. 1)
that Hübner (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrbuch des Vereins von Alterthumsfreunden im Rheinlande</cite>,

which he had given in the <i>Corpus</i>, and interpreted <i>D. M. NODONTI</i> as d(eo)

side, though the majority had the head at the north end of the grave: there
was thus’, he adds, ‘no tendency to face the sun, as in the Bronze period’.
Since the bodies, on whichever side they lay, would have faced either the
morning or the afternoon sun, Mr. Smith’s observation apparently assumes
that in the Bronze period corpses were laid so as to face the morning sun,
which was far from being an invariable rule. See pp. 188-9, <i>supra</i>, and the authorities
there cited; also <cite>Wilts Archaeol. and Nat. Hist. Mag.</cite>, x, 1866, p. 101.

were laid on the right or the left side. [See Addenda.]</p></div>

‘The political condition of the people of Brythonic Britain,’ says Prof.
Rhys (<cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, 3rd ed., 1904, pp. 57, 61), ‘towards the end of the Early
Iron Age and the close of their independence, is best studied in connection with
that of Gaul as described by Caesar.... The state of things, politically speaking,
which existed in Gaul, existed also most likely among the Belgic tribes in
Britain.’ That is to say, the professor accepts the political part of Caesar’s
description as applying to the Belgic and the other Brythonic tribes of both
Gaul and Britain. Yet he insists that that part of the same description which
deals with Druidism, and which is indissolubly connected with the political
part, has nothing to do either with the Belgae or the other Brythons.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1239" href="#FNanchor_1239" class="label">1239</a>
Professor Rhys virtually admits this when he says that the Brythonic dialect
was largely influenced by the language of the aborigines. See p. 452, n. 8, <i>infra</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1240" href="#FNanchor_1240" class="label">1240</a>
The problem of the origin of Druidism is interesting as an example of the
divergence which exists among Celtic scholars upon almost every important
question of Celtic religion, and also because it once more illustrates the working
of that powerful but erratic engine,&mdash;the mind of Professor Rhys. The first
known mention of Druidism, the substance of which is reproduced in Diogenes
Laertius’s <cite>Lives of the Philosophers</cite>, occurred in a work by Sotion of Alexandria,
who lived about 200 <small>B.C.</small> From this, M. d’Arbois de Jubainville (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Principaux
auteurs de l’ant. à consulter sur l’hist. des Celtes</cite>, 1902, pp. 187-8) infers that the
Belgic invaders of Britain found Druidism flourishing there about that date,
and transplanted it into the country which they had left, but with which they
kept up a constant intercourse. M. d’Arbois has consistently maintained
this view for many years; and under his influence Professor Rhys affirmed
in 1879 (<cite>Lectures on Welsh Philology</cite>, 2nd ed., pp. 83-4) that Druidism reached
Gaul ‘undoubtedly through the Belgae who had settled in Britain’. Now,
however, the professor rightly holds that the Belgae were preceded in Britain
by other Brythons (<cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, 1904, p. 4); and it would seem therefore
that the date of the first mention of Druidism gives no clue as to the place
where it originated. Moreover, Professor Rhys has long been of opinion that
there is ‘no proof that any Belgic or Brythonic people ever had Druids’
(<i>ib.</i>, 2nd ed., 1884, p. 69; 3rd ed., 1904, p. 69; <cite>Report of ... the Brit. Association</cite>,
1900, p. 894). In 1901, accordingly, he argued (<cite>Celtic Folk-lore</cite>, ii, 623,
685) that the Goidelic invaders of Britain (whose existence, I must remind
the reader, is denied by some Celtic scholars) ‘got their magic and druidism’
from ‘the [imaginary] dwarf race of the <i>sids</i>’ (see p. 391, <i>infra</i>). But in 1900
(<cite>The Welsh People</cite>, p. 83) and again in 1902 (<i>ib.</i>, 3rd ed.) he affirmed that
Druidism had been ‘evolved by the Continental Goidels, or rather accepted
by them from the Aborigines’. Presumably, then, they already had Druids
when they invaded Britain, and had no need to borrow them from the <i>sids</i>.
By 1904, however, the professor appears to have concluded that Druidism
originated independently among the aborigines both of Gaul and of Britain,
and that with both it was an inheritance from common ancestors; for, after
telling us (<cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, 3rd ed., p. 69) that Druidism ‘may be surmised to
have had its origin’ among ‘the non-Celtic natives’ of Britain, he goes on
to say that it ‘possessed certain characteristics which enabled it to make
terms with the Celtic conqueror, both in Gaul and in the British islands’;
while on page 73 he remarks that ‘it is hard to accept the belief ... that
druidism originated here’, and concludes that ‘the Celts found it both here
and there [in Gaul] the common religion of some of the aboriginal inhabitants’.
But the weary student who hopes to be allowed to acquiesce in this conclusion
is distracted by finding that on page 4 of this very book, in which the professor
insists that ‘there is no proof that any ... Brythonic people ever had Druids’,
he affirms that ‘traces of [the Goidels] are difficult to discover on the Continent’
(<cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, p. 4). This time the conclusion would seem to be that the
Gauls, whose Druids Caesar described, were neither Goidels nor Brythons!
It is hardly necessary to add that the professor has since satisfied himself
(see p. 410, <i>infra</i>) that traces of Continental Goidels are abundant.</p>

<p>As we have already seen (p. 114, <i>supra</i>), M. S. Reinach (<cite>Acad. des inscr.
et belles-lettres</cite>,&mdash;comptes-rendus de l’année 1892, 4<sup>e</sup> sér., xx, 6-7) attributes
the megalithic monuments of Gaul to Druidical influence, arguing that their
construction is inexplicable except on the hypothesis of ‘une aristocratie
religieuse exerçant un empire presque absolu sur une nombreuse population’
(<cite>Rev. celt.</cite>, xiii, 1892, p. 194). Certainly: but if it is a fair conclusion that
this hierarchy was composed of Druids, might it not be argued that Druidism
was a world-wide institution, or at least co-extensive with rude stone monuments?
On the other hand, Professor J. von Pflugk-Harttung (<cite>Trans. Roy.
Hist. Soc.</cite>, N. S., vii, 1893, p. 57) can see no reason for supposing that Druidism
was originally non-Aryan.</p>

<p>M. Camille Jullian (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rev. des études anc.</cite>, vi, 1904, p. 260) seems inclined to
believe that the priests (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacerdotes</cite>) of the Cisalpine Boii (Livy, xxiii, 24, § 12)
were Druids; and I admit that it is impossible to prove that they were not.</p>

<p>[M. d’A. de Jubainville, in his latest volume (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Druides</cite>, p. 13), infers from
Caesar’s statement, that Druidism originated in Britain, that it was of Goidelic
[why not pre-Goidelic?] origin, and holds (pp. 22-3) that it was imposed by the
Goidels upon their Gallo-Brythonic conquerors.</p></div>

This statement is, I admit, open to dispute. Caesar (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, vii, 33, § 4)
does not expressly say that Druids exercised the right in question, but priests
(<i>sacerdotes</i>); and it has been argued that those priests may not have been
Druids (see my <cite>Caesar’s Conquest of Gaul</cite>, 1899, p. 534, n. 3, and G. Dottin,
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La rel. des Celtes</cite>, p. 41). But, so far as we know, the only other name that
designated a priest in Gaul was <i>gutuater</i>, which occurs in two Gallo-Roman
inscriptions (<i>ib.</i>, and <cite>Caesar’s Conquest of Gaul</cite>, 1899, p. 818); and I doubt
whether it is possible to prove that in pre-Roman times the <i>gutuater</i> was not
a Druid. Anyhow, considering the terms in which Caesar describes the Druids,
considering what he says of their power, political and legal as well as spiritual
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fere de omnibus controversiis publicis privatisque constituunt</i>), I find it difficult
to believe that they would have permitted any priest who was not one of
themselves to exercise the very important function which he describes in <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>,
vii, 33. [For confirmation of the statement in the text see H. d’A. de Jubainville,
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Druides</cite>, p. 159, who, however (pp. 2-6), insists that <i>gutuatri</i> were
distinct from Druids.]</p></div>

forent ad bella meliores, aeternas esse animas vitamque alteram ad manes. Itaque
cum mortuis cremant ac defodiunt apta viventibus</i>), asserts that the teaching
of the Druids differed from that of Pythagoras: they did not inculcate metempsychosis,
but merely the immortality of the soul. He also insists, quoting
Valerius Maximus, ii, 6, § 10, that, in the belief of the Gauls, the life to come
was analogous to life upon earth (cf. N. Fréret, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Œuvres complètes</cite>, xviii, 1796,
pp. 182-8). But it is not proved that Caesar, whose authority is higher than
that of Mela, and whose testimony is not really contradicted by him, was misinformed
when he said that the Druids taught <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non interire animas, sed ab aliis
post mortem transire ad alios</i>; and Valerius Maximus himself remarks that
the belief of the Gauls was identical with that of Pythagoras. Many Christians,
who believe in the immortality of the soul, also believe, or fancy that they
believe, in the transmigration of souls. Still, as I have suggested in the text,
it is quite possible that even the Druids did not preach the Pythagorean doctrine
of metempsychosis, and that Caesar did not intend to convey that they did.</p></div>

Of course we have no right to assume that the calendar of Coligny, which was

<p>The language of the calendar is a subject of dispute. Prof. Rhys and

as Celtic: M. d’Arbois de Jubainville regards the association of <i>qu</i> with <i>p</i> (see pp.
227-8, <i>supra</i>) as proof of its being Ligurian. [Prof. Rhys’s latest view (<cite>Celtic
Inscr. of France and Italy</cite>, p. 99) is that ‘it becomes more and more a question
of names, whether it is to be called Celtic or Ligurian’. But the fact remains
that history and physical anthropology tend to show that the Ligurians were
utterly different from the people among whom the Celtic language came into
being. See my <cite>Caesar’s Conquest of Gaul</cite>, 1899, pp. 275-81.]</p></div>

or soothsayers, mentioned by Diodorus Siculus (v, 31, § 3) or the οὐάτεις
who, according to Strabo (iv, 4, § 4), were specially concerned with sacrifices.
Μάντεις and οὐάτεις, however, who were doubtless identical, would seem
to have been merely Druids of inferior rank (G. Dottin, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Manuel pour servir

is any authority for translating the word by ‘Druidesses’, and insists that
if Druidesses had existed, they would not have been mentioned for the first
time by writers of the 3rd century. A. Holder (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Alt-celtischer Sprachschatz</cite>,

The question may be asked, If there were Druids in South-Eastern Britain,
why does Caesar not tell us what part they took, or whether they took any
part, in the campaign of Cassivellaunus? As all readers of his memoirs have
remarked, he is equally silent in regard to the political activity or the political
apathy of the Druids of Gaul. ‘A singularly powerful priesthood,’ says
Prof. Haverfield (<cite>Eng. Hist. Rev.</cite>, xviii, 1903, p. 336), ‘numbering political
leaders, like Divitiacus, among its ranks, might be expected in a national crisis
to take some definite line, requiring notice in the <cite>Commentaries</cite>. Yet omit
two chapters, and so far as the <cite>Commentaries</cite> go, the Druids might never have
existed.’ M. Camille Jullian (<cite>Vercingétorix</cite>, 1902, pp. 107-11) argues that
they did take an active part in the rebellion of Vercingetorix, but that Caesar
chose to ignore the fact: Caesar ‘<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">a laïcisé à outrance l’esprit et l’histoire de la
Gaule.... Nul ne croira que la Gaule n’ait pas appelé prêtres et dieux à son
secours</i>’. Prof. Haverfield, who naturally asks ‘What motive had Caesar for
this?’ suggests that an analogy ‘to these powerful non-political priests ... is
provided by various priestly <i>collegia</i> at Rome, which include political leaders,
but which in their augural or other capacity take no political action’, and
maintains that the Druids, ‘as Druids, uttered no word against Caesar or for
him’. But if so, why, at a time when their power had certainly diminished,
did they aid and abet the insurrection of Civilis (Tacitus, <cite>Hist.</cite>, iv, 54)?
I would suggest that Caesar may have bought over the Arch-Druid (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, vi,
13, § 8)&mdash;and his use of secret-service money is one of the matters which he
did not mention&mdash;and that if individual Druids did take part in a crusade,
he may not have thought their action sufficiently important (if he was aware
of it) to be worth recording.</p></div>

Professor Rhys (<cite>The Welsh People</cite>, 1902, pp. 88-90) remarks that ‘since
no hint as to a revolution is vouchsafed [in Caesar’s narrative (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, ii, 4,
§ 7)], the probability is that the empire of Diviciacos in this country subsisted
under his successors in Caesar’s time. But,’ he continues, ‘Diviciacos’s people
were the Suessiones and the Remi; so we should expect to find both of them
represented in Britain, though their names have not been detected. Now we
know from a couple of inscriptions that a god of the Remi was Camulos.’ The
professor goes on to observe that Camulodunum ‘was near Colchester, in the
country of the Trinovantes, in whom we are accordingly prepared to find
the Remi we are seeking’; and, he says, ‘The next neighbours of the Trinovantes
were the Catuvellauni, in whom we probably have our insular Suessiones.
At any rate the name of the Catuvellauni was also that which, shortened into
<i>Catelauni</i> ... eventually became ... Chalons, the name of a town ... in a district
usually assigned to the Remi ... the Catuvellauni and the Trinovantes
between them may be regarded as the upholders of the empire of Diviciacos,’
&amp;c. But in Caesar’s time the Catuvellauni were the bitter enemies of the
Trinovantes: Camulos was worshipped by many other tribes besides the
Remi; and although it is probable that the Gallic Catuvellauni were clients
of the Remi in the time of Caesar (Rice Holmes, <cite>Caesar’s Conquest of Gaul</cite>,
1899, pp. 476-7), it is not unlikely that they were one of the tribes which
placed themselves under the protection of the Remi in consequence of the
favour shown to the latter by Caesar (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, vi, 12, § 7). The passage in which
Caesar mentions Diviciacus leaves upon my mind the impression that his
empire, like that of Celtillus, the father of Vercingetorix, was short-lived. At
all events there is no evidence for asserting its continuance.</p></div>

A gale blowing from the north-east on the eastern coast of Kent would be
diverted on the south coast to ENE. This, or possibly NE. by E., may
be assumed to have been the direction of the wind when the transports were
scudding before it. If it had blown from a point nearer north they would have
found shelter under the lee of the southern cliffs. See p. 582, <i>infra</i>.</p></div>

It is impossible to decide whether the cohort or half-cohort which reported
to Caesar (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, iv, 32, § 1) was an outlying piquet, as von Göler thinks (<cite>Gall.
Krieg</cite>, 1880, p. 136, n. 2), or a guard stationed just outside one of the gates.
The latter appears to have been the usual position. (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, vi, 37, §§ 3-4;
<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Civile">B. C.</abbr></cite>, i, 75, § 3; iii, 94, § 6). Von Göler’s opinion is based upon a mistranslation
of the word <i>longius</i> (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, iv, 32, § 3).</p></div>

See <cite>Vict. Hist. of ... Norfolk</cite>, i, 284-5. I am inclined to think that the
Bibroci, whether their name is connected with that of Berkshire or not, and
the other two may have lived on the south of the Thames. Otherwise would
they not have been clans either of the Trinovantes or the Catuvellauni? It
seems unlikely that any group included in the latter would have dared in spite
of Cassivellaunus to surrender. Dr. Haverfield (R. L. Poole’s <cite>Hist. Atlas
of Mod. Europe</cite>, 1896, xv,&mdash;‘Roman Britain’) suggests that the Bibroci may
have been in Berkshire, and that they and the Segontiaci were clans of the
Atrebates.</p></div>

22, 7 (9). Sir J. Evans (<cite>Coins</cite>, &amp;c., p. 36) says that Solinus made the
statement quoted in the text about the Silures of South Wales; but he speaks
of the inhabitants of the island of Silura, which, he says, is separated from
the country of the Dumnonii (Cornwall) by a stormy strait (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Siluram insulam
ab ora quam gens Brittana Dumnonii tenent turbidum fretum distinguit</i>).
Mommsen, in his edition of Solinus (p. 113), remarks that as there is no island
called Silura, we must either accept the reading of the ‘interpolated’ MSS.,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">insulae Sillinae</i> (Scilly islands), or assume that Solinus based his statement
upon a careless perusal of the passage in which Pliny (<cite>Nat. Hist.</cite>, iv, 16 [30],
§ 103) mentions the Silures (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">super eam</i> [Britanniam] <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">haec</i> [Hibernia] <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sita abest
brevissimo transitu a Silurum gente xxx</i>). Considering what Solinus says about
the Dumnonii, I would adopt the former alternative.</p></div>

J. Rhys, <cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, 3rd ed., 1904, pp. 29, 62. Professor Rhys (<i>ib.</i>,
pp. 40-1) remarks further that on coins of the Parisi ‘one Volisios styles
himself sometimes Domnocoveros and sometimes Domnoveros, which may
possibly have meant the guardian of the state, or the man of the people. At
any rate ... the same term occurs on a coin of Dumnorix, the Æduan, whose
great popularity with the common people Caesar dwells upon more than once.... On
another of these northern coins the person who issued it gives himself
a title, which, if correctly read Senotigirnios, would literally mean the old
lord or monarch, whatever the exact official signification of that may have
been among the Parisi. Unfortunately, the relation of these two kinds of
coins to one another in point of time is not known; should they turn out
to be of the same date, they might be taken to prove the state to have been
divided into two parties, the one clinging to the representative of a dynasty,
and the other rallying round one who gave himself out as the friend of the
people.’</p>

<p>The professor’s ‘proof’, resting as it does upon possibilities and uncertainties,
is hardly conclusive. Moreover the reading <small>DOMNOVEROS</small> does not occur
at all, and must be replaced by <small>DVMNOVELLAVNOS</small> (J. Evans, <cite>Coins of the Anc.
Britons</cite>, Suppl., p. 591)&mdash;the same name as that of the prince who sought the
aid of Augustus (p. 363, <i>infra</i>); while the reading <small>SENOTIGIRNIOS</small> is hopelessly
uncertain (J. Evans, <cite>Coins</cite>, &amp;c., pp. 405, 410-1). The term which
occurs on the coins of Dumnorix (assuming that Dumnorix and Dubnorex are
identical) is <small>DVBNOCOV</small> (E. Muret and M. A. Chabouillet, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cat. des monnaies
gaul. de la Bibl. Nat.</cite>, 1889, Nos. 5026-48).</p>

<p>It is impossible to decide whether the coins to which Professor Rhys alludes
belong to the Parisi or to the Brigantes (J. Evans, <cite>Coins</cite>, &amp;c., Suppl., p. 589).</p></div>

According to Xiphilinus, the continuator and epitomator of Dion Cassius

(<cite>Provinces</cite>, i, 171 [<cite>Röm. Gesch.</cite>, v, 156]), Dubnovellaunus was ‘probably the successor
of the prince of the Trinovantes confirmed by Caesar’. The only ground
for this conjecture is that Dubnovellaunus appears to have had temporary
dominion over the country of the Trinovantes, which had previously been
annexed by Tasciovanus. But the fragmentary numismatic evidence which
is all that we have to go upon seems to show that Dubnovellaunus was originally
King of Kent.</p></div>

Gold coins have been found, struck by a king named Addedomaros,
which appear to show that he began to reign earlier than Cunobeline, and
that his dominions were in the eastern counties, their centre being Essex;
but there is no evidence for defining his relations with Cunobeline or Dubnovellaunus

This is the theory of Professor Rhys (<cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, 1904, pp. 36-8) and
apparently also of Sir John Evans (<cite>Coins of the Anc. Britons</cite>,&mdash;Suppl.,
pp. 489-93, with which cf. p. 584 and pp. 358, 366-7, 381-5, 387-9 of the
earlier volume); but it will not bear examination. Bericus was one of the
fugitives whose retention at Rome was resented by the two sons of Cunobeline
who remained in Britain. It is admitted, or rather maintained, by Professor
Rhys that the Iceni were hostile to the dynasty of Cunobeline. It would
seem therefore that if, as the professor suggests, Antedrigus was forced to
flee from the Iceni when they joined the Romans, he belonged to a party among
the Iceni which was not opposed to the sons of Cunobeline and was perhaps
even in sympathy with them. But if he had prevailed over Bericus and
forced him to flee, his party was evidently the stronger. Why then should
he have been forced to quit the Icenian territory? Are we to assume that
the anti-Catuvellaunian party among the Iceni, to which Bericus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex hypothesi</i>
belonged, was originally the weaker, but on the return of Bericus suddenly
became the stronger? May we not rather suppose that Bericus was one of
the sons of Cunobeline and was for some reason at variance with his brothers,
Caratacus and Togodumnus; that the Iceni, with whom he was in sympathy,
were for the most part or as a whole opposed to them; and that Antedrigus
was not the leader of a faction but the king of the Iceni, who, like Gallic kings
mentioned by Caesar, was unpopular with his nobles and his subjects generally,
and was by them forced to flee?</p></div>

A few years ago Professor Macalister (<cite>Journ. Anthr. Inst.</cite>, xxiii, 1894,
pp. 407-8) propounded a set of questions which, he suggested, might be
answered by the help of an ‘ethnographic census’:&mdash;‘Have we’, he asked,
‘any representatives of the pre-Celtic inhabitants? ... if so, are such people
of a pre-Aryan stock, and are they of the same type as the long-headed people
in the long barrows? ... Are these the Silures? ... Were the Celtic immigrants
homogeneous? ... What relation subsisted between the Cymric and Gaidhelic-speaking
peoples?’ &amp;c. It will be apparent to any one who reads this article
that most of these questions can be answered without the aid of an ‘ethnographic
census’; and that, if they could not be answered independently, such
aid would be insufficient unless it could be supplemented by new archaeological
and linguistic information. The unofficial census which has been carried out
by Dr. Beddoe, M. H. Muffang, Sir William Turner, and, perhaps in consequence
of Professor Macalister’s suggestion, by Dr. C. R. Browne, Messrs. Gray and
Tocher, and other anthropologists, is of course incomplete; but it may be
doubted whether the evidence which they have collected would be seriously
modified by further investigation. When Dr. Collignon undertook a similar
informal census in France, he compared in each department the mean cephalic
index of the whole number of the heads which he had measured with that of
the ten which he had measured first; and in every instance the difference
was less than 1 per cent. (Rice Holmes, <cite>Caesar’s Conquest of Gaul</cite>, 1899, p. 320).</p></div>

I say ‘for our purpose’ because of many of the skeletons with which we
are here concerned the only relevant measurement that exists is that of the
thigh-bone. Dr. Garson (<cite>Journ. Anthr. Inst.</cite>, xxii, 1893, p. 9) thinks that the
‘most reliable estimate of stature is obtained from the length of the femur
and tibia added together’ according to the formula (Femur + Tibia x 100) / 49.4</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_1533" href="#FNanchor_1533" class="label">1533</a>
<i>Ib.</i>, xvii, 1888, p. 204. Dr. Beddoe’s arguments are very strong; and his
method appears to me better, on the whole, than that of Dr. Topinard, expressed
by the formula (Femur x 100) / 27·1 (<i>ib.</i>, xxii, 1893, p. 9), or than that of M. Rollet
(<i>ib.</i>, p. 19, note), expressed by the formula (Femur x 100) / 27·3. So far as I know,
the most exhaustive discussion of the question is that of M. L. Manouvrier
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mém. de la Soc. d’anthr.</cite>, 2<sup>e</sup> sér., iv, 1892, pp. 347-402), who points out defects
in the methods of Dr. Beddoe and MM. Topinard and Rollet; but although
he has perhaps shown how greater accuracy can be achieved, the more or less
approximate results that have been already obtained are sufficient for our
purpose: we should not be in a better position for solving the problems of the
ethnology of Ancient Britain even if the Britons whose skeletons have been
preserved had been measured in their lifetime, and the measurements recorded.</p>

<p>[Since the foregoing note was written I have read a most interesting paper
by Dr. Beddoe (<cite>Journ. Roy. Inst. Cornwall</cite>, xv, 1902, pp. 161-78), which
confirms my conviction that his is the best method of measurement, although
he confesses (p. 165) that it ‘probably errs by excess in the higher statures’.
Remarking (p. 163) that prehistoric bones ‘have lost much of their original
substance, and are probably from 1 to 3 millimetres short of their original
length’, he says, ‘Manouvrier does not seem to have made any provision for
this reduction; and I apprehend that his computed statures must on an
average be a little too low’. See Addenda.]</p></div>

<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>, xvii, 1906, pp. 308-9. It has been maintained that another&mdash;the
so-called steatopygous&mdash;race existed in Gaul in late palaeolithic times.
If any reader does not know the meaning of ‘steatopygous’, let him use his
dictionary, and he will pardon me for not having translated the word into
plain English. The existence of this people is inferred from the discovery
of certain ‘statuettes’ at Brassempouy in the department of the Landes
(<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>, vi, 1895, pp. 129-51) and near Mentone. I have not seen them;
but when I saw the woodcut of one which was selected for illustration (<cite>Bull.
et mém. de la Soc. d’anthr.</cite>, 5<sup>e</sup> sér., iii, 1902, p. 775, fig. 4), it seemed to me that
the carving was so villainous that no scientific conclusion could be drawn
from it; and I am glad to find (p. 778) that this was the opinion of M. Manouvrier.
M. Piette, however, assures us (<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>, vi, 1895, p. 143) that the
‘Venus of Brassempouy’ is ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’œuvre d’art la plus parfaite qui soit sortie des
mains des sculpteurs éburnéens</span>’. Anyhow, though it would not be difficult
for a sculptor to make statuettes of steatopygous individuals in the England
of to-day, there is no evidence that the ‘race’ in question, if it existed in
palaeolithic Gaul, ever penetrated into this country.</p></div>

To quote Mr. Allen Brown (<cite>Journ. Anthr. Inst.</cite>, xxii, 1893, p. 93), ‘Sir J.
Evans says, “It is almost demonstrable that some of the chipped celts which
have hitherto been classed as Neolithic must be among the earliest of the
Neolithic implements,” and “must in all probability date back to a very distant
period”. It is to these forms, which appear to be of transition age, that I would
apply the term Mesolithic.... At present some flint implements, which from
their form would be ranged under one of the later Palaeolithic groups by the
French geologists, would be included in the ... Neolithic in England.’ Mr.
Brown’s quotation from Sir John Evans (<cite>Anc. Stone Implements</cite>, pp. 85-6) is

He tells us (<cite>Monthly Review</cite>, Jan., 1901, pp. 139-40) that ‘the early Gaelic
chroniclers assert that the Gaels were preceded in Scotland and Ireland by
two races’ [the Picts and the Dananns]. ‘Of them too,’ he adds, ‘it is said
that they lived in hidden habitations, that they also persecuted the newer
race.’ In other words, the ‘mound-folk’ who, according to Professor Rhys,
were ‘slaves and drudges’ of the neolithic race, were themselves persecutors
of the Celts. That the Picts, or some of them, lived in ‘hidden habitations’
I am not concerned to deny; as for the ‘Dananns’ of Irish legend, I would
ask Mr. MacRitchie to read what Professor Rhys (<cite>Celtic Heathendom</cite>, p. 119)
has written about them. ‘The earliest Scottish writer, so far as I am aware,’
continues Mr. MacRitchie (<cite>Monthly Review</cite>, Jan., 1901, p. 141), ‘who speaks
of the Picts as a small race living underground was a fifteenth-century Bishop
of Orkney, Thomas Tulloch.... Tulloch compiled a Latin account of Orkney
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Orcadibus Insulis</i>) ... and therein he states that the Picts inhabiting those
islands ... in the ninth century were “not much bigger than pigmies in stature”,
and that ... they occasionally took refuge “in little houses underground”’. The
work of Tulloch, or rather Tullock, is not mentioned in the catalogue of the
British Museum; and I cannot verify Mr. MacRitchie’s quotation. But is
the statement of a fifteenth-century compiler about the stature of a people
who lived in the ninth century to be taken seriously as evidence? And if so,
what does it prove about the Picts as a whole? What more does it prove
than this,&mdash;that in a remote group of islands there were dwarfish people who
were included under the name ‘Picts’,&mdash;a name which of course denoted not
a race but a heterogeneous population, comprising people whom the physical
anthropologist would classify under several heads?</p></div>

discovery of which in the Paviland cave, Glamorganshire, was recorded in
1824 by Dean Buckland (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Reliquiae Diluvianae</cite>, p. 82), says:&mdash;‘In this group
of remains so widely spread over Europe, we are on the track of a very early
Prehistoric people, belonging to a tall, long-headed race, without the knowledge
of pottery and without polished axes, if negative evidence be accepted.... They
are probably the advance-guard of the Neolithic migration.... Further
evidence is needed before we can define their precise relation to the Neolithic
culture ordinarily so called.’ Further evidence is also needed before we can
affirm that the Paviland skeleton was neolithic at all (Sir J. Evans, <cite>Anc. Stone
Implements</cite>, &amp;c., 1897, p. 487).</p></div>

M. d’Arbois de Jubainville formerly pointed out, in support of Tacitus’s
conclusion, that, according to Festus Avienus (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ora maritima</cite>, 433), there was
a mountain in the Spanish peninsula called <i>Silurus</i> (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les premiers habitants de
l’Europe</cite>, i, 1889, p. 44). But, since the origin of the name <i>Silures</i> is unknown,
it seems rash to found an ethnological argument on its resemblance to <i>Silurus</i>.
In Mexico there is a river called Tamesi: would M. d’Arbois infer from the
name which Caesar latinized into <i>Tamesis</i> that the people who named this
river were akin to the prehistoric inhabitants of Britain? M. d’Arbois has
since argued that the Silures could not have been Iberian (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Celtes</cite>, p. 30); but
his recantation is hardly more reasonable than his original theory.</p></div>

<i>Ib.</i>, pp. 267-8. Professor Boyd Dawkins (<cite>Early Man in Britain</cite>, p. 334)
argues that ‘the identification of the Neolithic aborigines with ... the modern
Basques, is confirmed by’ the fact that <i>aizcora</i>, the Basque word for an axe,
means ‘stone mounted in a handle’: but how does this tend to establish
the identity of the British neolithic aborigines with the Basques? It only
shows that the ancestors of the Basques used stone tools.</p>

Spanish Basques represent ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une race croisée, à la constitution de laquelle
a pris part, en tant que facteur principal, la <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">race ibérique</cite>, la vieille race de
Baumes-Chaudes’. ‘Il est clair</span>’, he adds (pp. 221-2), ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que les Hispano-Basques
se différenciant des Gallo-Basques par tous leurs points de ressemblance
avec les Ibères, les Gallo Basques ne peuvent à aucun titre être rattachés
à ces derniers ... les Ibères, en tout cas, n’ont joué qu’un rôle médiocre dans
leur ethnogénie</span>’. On pp. 235-7 M. Hervé offers certain tentative suggestions
as to the origin of the Basques, whose purest representatives are the French
Basques, and whose physical characters raise them, he considers, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans conteste

primitive Scandinavian dolichocephali were only one of the numerous branches
of his ubiquitous ‘Eurafrican species’. He insists that the modern Scandinavian
‘cranial and skeletal facial forms’ are identical with those of the
Mediterranean race; and the tallness and fairness of the Scandinavians do
not in the least shake his faith. ‘Northern Europe,’ he says (p. 254), ‘has
given origin to the white skin, blond hair, and blue or grey eyes’ of the Scandinavians.
Then why did it not produce the same phenomena among the Lapps
and the ‘Iberians’ of the British Isles? See also <cite>Rev. arch.</cite>, 4<sup>e</sup> sér., iii, 1904,

races were branches of the same primitive stock. See p. 434, n. 7, <i>infra</i>.</p></div>

opinion that of all European dolmens the most ancient are those of Northern
Germany; but the only reason which he gives, namely, that this region is on

were constructed of ‘erratic’ rocks, does not seem worth discussing.</p></div>

inhabitants of the British Isles was Iberian, affirms that the linguistic
evidence is sufficient to show that it was non-Aryan. Similarly Professor
Rhys remarked at the meeting of the British Association in 1900 (<cite>Report</cite>, &amp;c.,

too small to supply a dozen or two [of names of streams] which would baffle

After I had written these words, I was glad to learn that they had the
support of Dr. Arthur Evans, who, speaking of the discoveries in the Mentone
caves, says (<cite>Journ. Anthr. Inst.</cite>, xxii, 1893, p. 301) that ‘it will no longer be
allowable to say that these supposed immigrants from Asia brought with them
at their first coming certain domestic animals, and had already attained
a knowledge of the potter’s art, and of the polishing of stone weapons’. And,
as M. Salomon Reinach has justly remarked (<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>, vii, 1896, p. 687), in
a criticism of the address which Dr. Evans delivered in 1896 at the meeting
of the British Association, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La race méditerranéenne s’offre d’abord à nos

The late Mr. Elton (<cite>Origins of Eng. Hist.</cite>, 1890, pp. 149-50) affirmed
that certain customs, of which the couvade was one, had ‘left distinct traces
in the usages which still prevail in the region of the Pyrenees. But,’ he continued,
‘at present there seems to be no point of connection between them
and anything which was ever observed in this country’; and he insisted
that this ‘should be taken into account by those who assert the identity of
the Iberians with the Britons of the Silurian type’. I have not asserted
that identity in the narrower sense in which Mr. Elton used the word ‘Iberian’:
nevertheless his objection has no force. The answer to it is, first, that the
couvade did survive in historical times, or leave traces of its former existence,
in Ireland, Scotland, and Yorkshire (pp. 94-5, <i>supra</i>); secondly, that the
custom prevails, or has prevailed, among peoples of every continent except
Australia, who could never have influenced one another (<i>ib.</i>); and lastly, that
it cannot be expected that widely scattered peoples who originally sprang
from one stock should continue to preserve all the customs of their ancestors.</p>

<p>The other ‘customs’ of which Mr. Elton spoke are not worth mentioning.
He simply affirmed that certain tribes who inhabited the Iberian peninsula in
ancient times had different customs. Naturally. The fact in no way tends to
prove that they did not belong to the same stock.</p></div>

‘the Joint Undivided Family persisted in Sparta long after it had disappeared
in the rest of Greece’, and that ‘Polybius, misunderstanding the practice,

instances from history to show that the ‘Pictish succession’ did not imply
matriarchy. ‘Julius Caesar,’ he says, ‘chose as his heir Octavius, his sister’s
grandson: was this matriarchy? Tiberius was the stepson of Augustus:
was this matriarchy? When a king had to be chosen among the Picts, the
son of the late king’s sister may sometimes have been preferred to his own
son; but the sister’s son must often have been the elder and more experienced
of the two.’ And so on (see also vol. xxiii, 1902, p. 359, vol. xxv, 1904, p. 206,
and <cite>Rev. arch.</cite>, 4<sup>e</sup> sér., v, 1905, p. 447). But the point is that during the time
for which the history of the Picts is known to us a Pictish king was never
once succeeded by his own son. M. d’Arbois de Jubainville’s arguments are
not required for the purpose of demonstrating that the ‘Pictish succession’
does not prove the Picts to have been <i>the</i> representatives of the neolithic
aborigines.</p></div>

The view, advocated by W. C. Borlase (<cite>Dolmens of Ireland</cite>, iii, 1042-3)
and others, that the Caledonians were Germans is hardly worth discussing.
There is absolutely no evidence for it, except the remark of Tacitus (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agricola</cite>, 11)
that ‘the red hair and large limbs of the inhabitants of Caledonia indicate
a German origin’; and everybody knows that the physical characters of the
Germans and the Celts, as described by the ancient writers, were virtually
identical (see my <cite>Caesar’s Conquest of Gaul</cite>, 1899, pp. 309-10, and <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rev. mensuelle
de l’École d’anthr.</cite>, vii, 1897, pp. 74, 89). It is possible that some of the Caledonians
may have been descended from immigrants who came from Germany;
but this, I need hardly say, would be quite consistent with the view that they
were a Celtic-speaking people.</p></div>

Those who are familiar with Professor Rhys’s writings will not be surprised
to find that his notion of the meaning of these words is unstable. In 1884 he
wrote (<cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, p. 240), ‘These words Cruithni and Prydyn are derived
from <i>cruth</i> and <i>pryd</i> respectively, which mean form’; and he added that ‘Duald
MacFirbis, quoted by Todd in a note on the Irish version of Nennius, p. vi,’
‘has rightly explained the former [Cruithni] as meaning a people who painted
the forms (crotha) of beasts, birds, and fishes on their faces, and ... on the
whole of the body. This,’ he observed, ‘agrees well enough with Claudian’s
vivid description of Stilicho’s soldiery, scanning the figures punctured with
iron on the body of the fallen Pict,’ &amp;c. In 1891 he threw both MacFirbis
and Claudian overboard: ‘We are not warranted,’ he said (<cite>Scottish Review</cite>,
xviii, 1891, p. 124), ‘in supposing that he [Claudian] drew his inspiration
from any deeper source than the popular etymology of the name Pictus,
interpreted as a Latin word.’ He went on to say (p. 131) that the silence
of Gildas, who hated the Picts, ‘is proof positive that neither Picts nor Scots
were in the habit of discolouring their skins to any greater extent than his
own people’; and he insisted that there was a grave objection to the explanation
given by MacFirbis, ‘namely, that it accounts for too few of the elements
of the word Cruithne.’ In 1900 (<cite>Report of ... the Brit. Association</cite>, p. 895) he
brushed aside the ‘proof positive’, and proclaimed his conviction that, after
all, the Picts really had tattooed themselves. In 1902 (<cite>The Welsh People</cite>,
pp. 79-80, n. 2) he observed that if <i>Cruithni</i> and <i>Prydyn</i> had been really derived
from <i>cruth</i> and <i>pryd</i>, ‘one could scarcely avoid treating <i>Cruithni</i> and <i>Prydyn</i>
as translations ... of the word <i>Pict</i> regarded as the Latin <i>pictus</i>, ‘painted’’;
and that ‘the supposition here suggested as to <i>Pretani</i> being merely a sort of
translation of ... <i>pictus</i> would compel us to regard the first use of <i>Pretani</i> as
dating no earlier than Caesar’s time’, which, as he truly remarks, chronology
will hardly allow us to do. In the 3rd edition of <cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, 1904, p. 242,
he reverts to his view of 1884.</p>

<p>Candour is a virtue; but how are we to follow a guide who is for ever changing
his mind?</p></div>

<i>Ib.</i>, 1904, pp. 153-4. Referring to p. 24 of Mr. Nicholson’s book, Professor
Rhys says (<cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, 1904, p. 153) that <i>Peanfahel</i> ‘points back to a Latin
term <i>penna(e)</i> or <i>pinna(e) valli</i>, “wing of the vallum,” that is, the pinnacle
or turret at the end of the wall’. Now ‘pinnacle or’ appears to have been
inserted in order to save the face of <i>pinna</i>. Does the professor mean ‘a pinnacle’,
or does he mean a ‘turret’? And if he means ‘a turret’, in what sense does
he use the word? A pinnacle would have been a feature far too insignificant
to give rise to a place-name; and a turret would have been equally insignificant
unless it was a defensive tower, in which case it would have been called
not <i>pinna</i> but <i>turris</i>. Professor Haverfield (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, lv, 1897, p. 196) speaks
of ‘the corner turret’ of the fort of Aesica on the Roman wall about midway
between Newcastle and Carlisle. Read his description of it, and you will
appreciate the absurdity of calling it a <i>pinna</i>, and the still greater absurdity
of the supposition that even a ‘corner turret’ could beget a geographical
name. There is no authority for the use of the word <i>pinna</i> in connexion with
a defensive wall, except in the sense of ‘pinnacle’, in which sense it is used
twice by Caesar (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, v, 40, § 6; vii, 72, § 4). The <i>pinnae</i> which he describes
were merely small pinnacles rising from a breastwork on an earthen rampart,
breastwork and pinnacles forming a battlement, and both being made of
wattlework (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pinnae loricaeque ex cratibus contexuntur</i> [<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, v, 40, § 6]. See
also C. E. C. Schneider’s note in his edition of Caesar, vol. ii, p. 565). The
notion that the geographical name <i>Peanfahel</i> ‘points back’ to a <i>pinna</i> is too
ridiculous to be discussed. Why not be content with Dr. Stokes’s etymology
in Bezzenberger’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beiträge</cite>, xviii, 1902, pp. 98, 108?</p></div>

Thirty years ago, however, Mr. J. R. Mortimer (<cite>Journ. Anthr. Inst.</cite>, vi,
1877, pp. 328-34) said, ‘My computation of the stature of these two types of
men&mdash;the brachycephalic and the dolichocephalic&mdash;is the very reverse of’
Thurnam’s; and he stated that of ten skeletons found in round barrows of
the Yorkshire Wolds between Driffield and Aldeborough, five, of which the
cephalic indices ranged from 70 to 75, averaged 5 ft. 9⅖ in. in height, while
five others, the indices of which ranged from 79 to 94, averaged only 5 ft.
5 in. The barrows, however, although no bronze was found in them, contained
not only ‘drinking-cups’ but also ‘food-vessels’ (<cite>Anthropologia</cite>, i, 1873-5,
pp. x-xi); and it may be concluded that they belonged to the Bronze Age.
Rolleston (<cite>Brit. Barrows</cite>, p. 654, n. 2) was therefore justified in presuming that
the tall dolichocephali who were buried in them belonged to ‘a mixed race’;
and, he said, ‘the effect of crossing ... is very usually to increase the size of
the mixed races.’ Still, the low stature of Mr. Mortimer’s brachycephali is
remarkable; and we shall see that they belonged to a distinct race, of which
other examples have since been exhumed.</p></div>

calculated by Dr. Beddoe’s method, would have been just over 5 ft. 9⅕ in.
(1 m. 758); of the twenty-seven mixed skeletons, 5 ft. 9⅗ in. (within a very
minute fraction), or approximately 1 m. 768. Calculated by M. Rollet’s method
(see p. 379, n. 2, <i>supra</i>), the figures would have been just under 5 ft. 8½ in.
and just over 5 ft. 9⅖ in. respectively.</p></div>

<i>Ib.</i> Thurnam’s figures are much about the same. He found that out of
70 skulls from round barrows 44 had indices ranging from 80 to 89 (<cite>Memoirs
Anthr. Soc.</cite>, iii, 1870, pp. 48-50; <cite>Archaeologia</cite>, xliii, 1871, pp. 543-4). There is
reason to believe that some of the round skulls found in round barrows had been
artificially flattened on the occiput in infancy; but Thurnam (<cite>Crania Britannica</cite>,
ii, pl. 45, p. 6) shows that their brachycephaly was only due in a minor degree
to this cause. I presume that Dr. Beddoe, in his article in <cite>L’Anthr.</cite> (v, 1894,
p. 522), did not take account of 15 skulls which were found in 1885-7, in
association with bronze and remains of the <i>urus</i>, during the excavation of the
Ribble Docks at Preston. Their cephalic indices range between 70·41 and

The statement in the text is of course perfectly consistent with the fact
that some of the earlier Brythonic invaders buried their dead in small round
barrows. See p. 435, n. 1, <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p>I am astonished to find that even such a well-informed writer as Mr. H. J.
Mackinder (<cite>Britain and the British Seas</cite>, 1902, p, 185) suggests that the Belgae
‘may well have been the broad-skulled “bronze” men of the round barrows’;
and that, according to Mr. C. H. Read (<cite>Guide to the Ant. of the Bronze Age</cite> [Brit.
Museum], p. 15), ‘the Gaels and Brythons ... are the people of the Round-barrows.’
It is rather puzzling to find that he fixes ‘the close of the Barrow
period about 900 <small>B.C.</small>’ (ib., p. 23), and yet assigns the first Brythonic invasion
to the fourth century <small>B.C.</small> He appears to think that the earliest invaders of
the Round Barrow period belonged to a non-Aryan race (<i>ib.</i>, pp. 24-5); and
he rightly distinguishes both the Goidels and the Brythons from the brachycephalic
neolithic population of Gaul (<i>ib.</i>, p. 22), whom he nevertheless erroneously
calls ‘the true Kelts’. See pp. 433-40, <i>infra</i>. I am still more puzzled
when I read in the <cite>Guide to the Ant. of the Early Iron Age</cite> (p. 2), for which
Mr. Read has made himself responsible, that ‘the Bronze Age inhabitants of
this country seem to have been the most closely connected with the true Kelts’,
whereas in the <cite>Guide to the Ant. of the Bronze Age</cite> (p. 15) they are sharply
distinguished from them.</p></div>

<p>The description which Dr. Collignon gives of the brachycephalic race of
France will show how totally unlike it is to the characteristic Round Barrow
type. He speaks (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ann. de Géogr.</cite>, v, 1896, p. 164) of ‘les caractères bien
connus de la race brachycéphale, à savoir, taille plutôt petite, cheveux foncés,

Prof. A. C. Haddon (<cite>Proc. Roy. Irish Acad.</cite>, 3rd ser., iv, 1896-8, pp. 583-4)
distinguishes ‘the short, swarthy, black- [or rather dark-brown] haired brachycephalic
race of Central Europe (the “Celtae” ... or the “Type de Grenelle” ...)’
from ‘the tall, fair, brachycephalic race that may have come from Denmark
(the “Celts” of some authors ... the “Round Barrow Race” of all authors)’.
To identify the Grenelle race with the Celtae is, however, misleading. The
Celtae (see pp. 438-9, <i>infra</i>) were a mixed population, comprising descendants
of various neolithic dolichocephalic tribes and of the Grenelle race and also real
Celts&mdash;the introducers of the Celtic language&mdash;who invaded Gaul about the
eighth century <small>B.C</small>.</p></div>

The skulls which have been found in the fort of Worlebury, near Weston-super-Mare,
belong, according to Prof. Macalister (C. W. Dymond and H. G.
Tomkins, <cite>Worlebury</cite>, 1886, pp. vii, 102-4), ‘to the so-called Iberian type’;
but they have ‘strong brow ridges’, and ‘the men were of strong muscular
build’. They appear to me to show signs of crossing with individuals of the
‘characteristic’ Round Barrow type; but it is impossible to determine whether
they were of Gallo-Brythonic descent or not. Prof. Macalister computed
the stature of five males, whose bones, except in one instance, did not belong
to the skulls, at 5 ft. 3 in., 5 ft. 5½ in., 5 ft. 8 in., 5 ft. 10 in., and 6 ft. 4 in., the
overage being 5 ft. 8½ in.</p></div>

‘Iberian’ and North-European dolichocephalic types, to the latter of which
the type which I call Celtic belongs, are traceable to the same origin. See

Partly because during the latter part of the period the custom of cremation
was prevalent in South-Eastern Britain. See p. 286, <i>supra</i>.</p>

<p>A considerable number of skeletons has been discovered in the so-called
‘Danes’ Graves’ in the parish of Driffield, Yorkshire, which undoubtedly
belong to the Early Iron Age, and were earlier than the time of Agricola (<cite>Proc.
Soc. Ant.</cite>, 2nd ser., xx, 1904-5, p. 257), by Dr. Thurnam (<cite>Archaeol. Journal</cite>,
xxii, 1865, pp. 109 n. 8, 264), Canon Greenwell (<i>ib.</i>, pp. 108-11, 264), and
Mr. J. R. Mortimer (<cite>Proc. Soc. Ant.</cite>, 2nd ser., xvii, 1897-9, pp. 119-28). The
cephalic indices of those male skulls which were found by Thurnam and Canon
Greenwell are 75, 76, 70, 75, and 71: the mean index of those in the collection
of Mr. Mortimer, who does not give the individual measurements, is 75.5; and
the indices of fourteen, which have lately been measured by Dr. Wright (<cite>Journ.
Anthr. Inst.</cite>, xxxiii, 1903, pp. 67, 70-1), and which, for aught that I know,
may have included the others, ranges from 68 to 79. Neither Thurnam, nor
Canon Greenwell, nor Mr. Mortimer says anything about stature; but the
average height of the men whose bones Dr. Wright measured would only have
been 5 ft. 3½ in. This is so low as to suggest that they were not Celts; and
the question of their origin has caused much discussion. The remains of
a chariot were found in one of the graves which Mr. Mortimer opened; but
chariots may of course have been used by non-Celtic Britons. According to
Thurnam, the skulls ‘appear to be distinguished from the ... long-barrow
type’, and might pass for those of modern inhabitants of Scandinavia; but the
pottery found in the graves by Canon Greenwell was not only unlike any which
he had discovered in other parts of Yorkshire, but also different from Scandinavian
or Anglo-Saxon ware. Moreover, he describes the mode of interment
as ‘unlike any which has been found in Denmark, Norway, or Sweden’. Therefore
I cannot agree with Dr. Wright, who thinks that the people in question
came from Scandinavia. All that is certain is that, like most of our Late Celtic
skeletons, they did not belong to the familiar tall Celtic type.</p>

<p>In Scorborough Park, near Beverley, there is a group of small mounds,
similar to the ‘Danes’ Graves’. Mr. Mortimer opened six of them in 1895,
and found two skulls ‘of a decidedly long type’.</p>

<p>Fourteen skulls at least have been found in and just outside the Glastonbury
marsh-village (<cite>Report of ... the Brit. Association</cite>, 1895, p. 519; 1896, p. 658;
1898 [1900], p. 695; 1899 [1901], p. 594; <cite>Proc. Somerset. Archaeol. and Nat.
Hist. Soc.</cite>, l, 1904, p. 80; li, 1905, pp. 88, 99-100); but no detailed description
of them has yet been published, though Prof. Boyd Dawkins (<cite>Vict. Hist. of ... Somerset</cite>,
i, 200) affirms that they ‘belong to the small dark Iberic inhabitants’,
and argues that as some of them belonged to men who had been decapitated,
they do not represent inhabitants of the village, but their enemies. Some,
however, belonged to young children, and were found in the hut-circles. There
is the same dearth of information about skeletons which have been found near
Birdlip, on the Cotswold Hills (<cite>Trans. Bristol and Gloster Archaeol. Soc.</cite>, v,
1880-1, pp. 137-41), and in the parish of St. Keverne, Cornwall (<cite>Archaeol.
Journal</cite>, xxx, 1873, pp. 267-72).</p>

<p>In the only interment of the Early Iron Age that has yet been discovered
in Scotland&mdash;a cist on the estate of Moredun in Midlothian (<cite>Proc. Soc. Ant.
Scot.</cite>, xxxviii, 1904, pp. 427-38)&mdash;which was probably not earlier than the
second century of our era (<i>ib.</i>, p. 438), two skeletons, apparently of females,
were found. It was only possible to calculate the stature of one, which,
estimated from the <i>femur</i> alone, by what method I do not know, was about
5 ft. 5½ in. This, for a woman, would be comparatively tall. The cephalic
index was 75; and, according to Dr. T. H. Bryce, who measured the skull
(<i>ib.</i>, pp. 439-45), ‘all the measurements and the indices deduced from them
are such as might belong to a [neolithic] skull from the chambered cairns,’ but
‘the general characters are markedly different. It resembles in general proportions
certain of the skulls from the “Danes’ Graves” ... described by
Dr. W. Wright ... but in form it does not fall in with any of his types ... the
skull shows rather closer affinities with the modern than with any ancient
type,’ &amp;c. Has Dr. Bryce seen any of the skulls from the Gallic tumuli of the
Early Iron Age?</p>

‘properly insist upon calling all those who speak the Celtic language, Celts ...
while the physical anthropologists, finding the Celtic language spoken by
people of divers physical types, with equal propriety hold that the term Celt,
if used at all, should be applied to that physical group or type of men which
includes the greatest number of those who use the Celtic language.’ I, on the
contrary, hold that in an ethnological inquiry the term should be applied to
‘that physical group’ (if we can discover it) among whom the Celtic language
came into being and who imposed it upon those whom they subdued; and I
would remind the philologers that if all who speak the Celtic language are
Celts, all who speak the English language, including the inhabitants of the

A. Kuhn’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beiträge zur vergleichenden Sprachforschung</cite>, &amp;c., v, 1868, p. 98.
Cf. J. Rhys, <cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, 1904, p. 291. The remark of Professor Rhys (<i>ib.</i>,
p. 2) that ‘Recent writers are of opinion that the terms Galli and Celtae argue
an ancient distinction of race’, and that ‘the latter first applied exclusively
to the aborigines’, is apparently based upon an entire misconception of the
writings of Broca and M. Alexandre Bertrand. Does the professor mean by
‘the aborigines’ the dolichocephalic neolithic Baumes-Chaudes race, or the
totally different brachycephalic neolithic Grenelle race? No French ethnologist
holds the opinion which Professor Rhys attributes to ‘recent writers’;
and even M. Bertrand, who distinguished ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les Celtes</span>’ from ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les Galates</span>’, was
careful to point out (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Celtes dans les vallées du Pô et du Danube</cite>, p. 36) that
between them there was no ‘distinction of race’. The reader should note
that, according to M. Bertrand, ‘les Galates,’ who conquered Gaul in the
Iron Age, belonged to ‘la race celtique’; that his tall fair ‘Celtes’, who had
invaded Gaul before, were not identical with, but only part of the mixed population
whom Caesar called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Celtae</i>; and that his ‘Galates’ were to be found
among the Celtae as well as among the Belgae. Professor Rhys, in a recent
paper (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Celtae and Galli</cite>, pp. 57-9, 62), assumes that as (according to his view)
both Goidelic and Gallo-Brythonic were spoken in the country of the Celtae,
the names <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Celtae</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Galli</i> correspond to the peoples who spoke the two dialects:
he argues that the Celtae were conquered by the Galli; and he concludes that
the two peoples were ethnologically distinct. Probably Goidelic Celts were
conquered by Gallo-Brythonic Celts; but what then? It remains certain
that conquered and conquerors were by themselves called collectively Celtae.
Why did the name of the conquered prevail over that of the conquerors if it
was essentially different? And does not Caesar expressly say that the two
names denoted one and the same people? As a matter of fact, the terms <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Celtae</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Galli</i>, as used by the ancient writers, including Polybius, were, generally
speaking, synonymous. Diodorus Siculus (v, 23, § 1) distinguished between
them; but as his Γαλάται included the Cimbri and other Germans, his testimony,
which implicitly contradicts that of Caesar, is worthless. Even if it could be
accepted it would only show that the Celtae, as a whole, differed from the Γαλάται,
not that the Galatic conquerors of the people who, after the conquest and
including the conquerors, were called Celtae, differed in race from earlier Celtic
conquerors. Moreover, as I have remarked in <cite>Caesar’s Conquest of Gaul</cite>
(p. 290), ‘anybody who carefully reads through the chapters in which he
[Diodorus] describes the inhabitants of Gaul, will see that he habitually uses
the word Γαλάται not in the restricted but in the general sense, including both
Γαλάται and Κελτοί.... In fact, though he thinks it necessary to warn his
readers that the Celtae were geographically distinct from the Galli, he draws
no physical distinction between them; and, in conformity with ancient usage,
he as a rule uses the two terms indifferently.’ See my <cite>Caesar’s Conquest of
Gaul</cite>, 1899, p. 300; M. Déchelette’s article in <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rev. de synthèse hist.</cite>, iii, 1901,
pp. 32-3; <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rev. de l’École d’anthr.</cite>, xv, 1905, pp. 216-30; and <cite>Rev. celt.</cite>, xxvii,

I am glad to find that I have the support of Dr. Collignon (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de géogr.</cite>,
v, 1896, p. 159), who speaks of ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la population pré-gauloise que Broca nommait
à tort les Celtes’. Similarly M. G. Hervé</span> (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rev. mensuelle de l’École d’anthr.</cite>,
vi, 1896, p. 99) says that ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>la race brachycéphale néolithique</i> ou <i>race de Grenelle</i> est
devenue à l’âge de bronze ... celle des <i>Celtes</i>, au sens que les anthropologistes
ont accoutumé d’attacher depuis Broca à ce dernier terme</span>’; and, as he remarks
(<i>ib.</i>, p. 104), the Celtic language was imposed on this people, long before they
and their conquerors were called by Caesar <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Celtae</i>, by invading Gauls. MM. Collignon
and Hervé do not perhaps make it sufficiently clear that the people
whom Broca called ‘les Celtes’ were not the brachycephalic neolithic race
alone, but that race <i>plus</i> mesaticephalic people also of neolithic origin <i>plus</i>
the conquerors of both.</p></div>

An Italian anthropologist, Dr. V. Barteletti (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archivio por l’antropologia e la
etnologia</cite>, xxxiii, 1903, pp. 277-85) affirms that red hair is an anomaly due to
the crossing of blond with dark people. On this theory it seems inexplicable
that in certain parts of the Highlands of Scotland and Wales red hair is very
much more common than anywhere in England or in those parts of the Continent
in which blonds and brunets have long been intermixed, and much more
common in the department of Finistère than elsewhere in France. See <cite>Crania

pp. 467-8), after remarking that ‘the defenders of the earth-work used flint,
and consequently the work itself is not later than the bronze period’, and that
the people who buried their dead on the Yorkshire wolds ‘were in the early
bronze phase of civilisation’, General Pitt-Rivers goes on to say, ‘the archaeologists
of Denmark have shown that the Early Bronze Age did not exist in
Denmark; the art of working in bronze was full-blown when it first entered
Denmark. If the invaders of Flamborough came from Denmark, and were, as
we suppose ... a bronze-using people, they would have brought with them
weapons of a more advanced type than those found in the tumuli of the wolds....
We are narrowed, therefore, to the opinion that the invaders of Flamborough,
if invaders they were, were the same people who landed on the south and south-east
coasts of England [the extreme improbability of which he has already
shown], or else that these dykes belong to the people of the country, who ...
were driven to the coast by another ... people who occupied the interior,’ &amp;c.
But why should the general assume that ‘the invaders of Flamborough’ were
‘a bronze-using people’? See pp. 119, 129, 131-2, 408-9, <i>supra</i>.</p></div>

chambered cairns of South-Western Scotland, and has found no bronze in
any of them, tells us (<cite>Man</cite>, iv, 1904, No. 110, p. 176) that in one at Glecknabae,
Bute, ‘fragments of four vessels were recovered, of the “beaker” or
“drinking-cup” class.’ ‘If,’ he says (<cite>Proc. Soc. Ant. Scot.</cite>, xxxviii, 1904,
p. 78), ‘we accept Mr. Abercromby’s conclusions that this class of ceramic
was introduced at the end of the Neolithic period, and that the type named α
is earlier than ... β and υ, we are obliged to conclude that the culture of the
Stone Age prevailed in the Western Islands for the whole period corresponding
to type α in South Britain.’</p></div>

Brythons. [For ‘Celticans’ he is now (?) inclined to substitute ‘Kelts’ of

Professor Rhys (<cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, 1904, pp. 214-5) denies that Brittany
was colonized ‘by Brythons from here’: but one of his arguments is simply
that the Dumnonii were not Brythons, which I deal with in the text; and
the other is equally unsatisfactory. Remarking that Procopius ‘gives a very
fabulous account of an island called Brittia’, he says that ‘Brittia must
have been a real name, as it is exactly the form which would result in that
which is the actual Breton name of Brittany&mdash;namely Breiz: this last,’ he
continues, ‘cannot be derived from any known form of the kindred name
of our country and its people, and thus tells not a little against the tradition
that Brittany was first colonised by Brythons from here,’ &amp;c. But who ever
heard of ‘the tradition that Brittany was <i>first</i> colonised by Brythons from here’?
And what if Brittany received the name which would have resulted in ‘Breiz’
<i>before</i> the British immigration? See my <cite>Caesar’s Conquest of Gaul</cite>, 1899,
p. 416, and J. Loth, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Émigration bretonne en Armorique</cite>, 1883, pp. 21, 50-1,

<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, i, 10, § 4; v, 39, § 1. Mr. Nicholson contends (<cite>Keltic Researches</cite>,
pp. 9-13) that the Belgae also colonized Anglesey, where he finds various place-names
of which <i>Bol</i> forms a part; South Wales, where St. David’s was
formerly called Meneu; both banks of the estuary of the Forth, where he
believes that he can find traces of the Irish stem <i>Manann</i>; and Galway, Mayo,
and other remote parts of Ireland, where the name <i>Mannin</i> is of frequent
occurrence. The Belgae, or rather the Menapii, would certainly seem to have
been not less enterprising as colonists than Mr. Nicholson as an etymologist.
Without straining the elasticity of the words <i>Menapii</i> and <i>Belgae</i> more than
he has already done, he could easily, with a little diligence and a good gazetteer,
find traces of them all over the world. Surely they must have settled in
<i>Bul</i>garia. But, seriously, I would ask the reader to consider whether it is likely
that they would have taken the trouble to go all the way to Connemara when
there was plenty of good land open to them in this country. And, considering
that they introduced the use of coins into Britain, is it not significant that no
British coins have been found in Ireland, and hardly any in Scotland or Wales?</p>

<p>Mr. Nicholson (<cite>Keltic Researches</cite>, pp. 11, 98-100) of course maintains that
the Fir-Bolg of Ireland were Belgae, and that there is an etymological connexion
between the two words. Professor Rhys, in a note to the second
edition of his <cite>Celtic Britain</cite> (p. 280), which in the third is absent, affirmed that
‘one thing is certain: neither the people [Belgae] nor its name had anything
whatever to do with the Irish Fir-bolg’. At all events, MacFirbis and other
Irish writers regarded the Fir-Bolg as having been found in Ireland and conquered
by the Celtic invaders (J. Rhys, <cite>Celtic Heathendom</cite>, p. 120; W. C. Borlase,
<cite>Dolmens of Ireland</cite>, iii, 1027-8).</p></div>

it in despair.’</p></div>

‘In case,’ says Mr. Nicholson (<cite>Keltic Researches</cite>, p. 16, n. 2), ‘any one
should quote against me Eppillus, the name of a son of Commius the Atrebat,
as derived from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">epos</i> for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equos</i>, let me say that in that case it ought to have
only one <i>p</i>.’ No doubt it is remarkable that the <i>p</i> should be double (Rhys,
<cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, 1904, p. 302); but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epillos</i>, which is certainly the same word
(A. Holder, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Alt-celtischer Sprachschatz</cite>, i, 1445), occurs on Gallic coins of the
Lemovices and on coins from Poitiers and the neighbourhood of Arles (E. Muret

<cite>Keltic Researches</cite>, pp. 25, 149. On page 26 (n. 1) Mr. Nicholson makes
the curious suggestion that ‘the Britons, strictly speaking, were the Kymric
branch who painted themselves, as distinguished from the Goidelic who tattooed’.
Is he prepared to argue that the Belgae, who, on his theory, were Goidels, and
with whom (p. 110) he apparently identifies ‘the original Brittones or Brittani’,
were not included among ‘the Britons, strictly speaking’? Will he maintain,
in the face of Caesar, from whom we learn that the Britons all ‘painted themselves
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnes vero se Britanni vitro inficiunt</i>)’, that ‘the great majority’
(p. 110) of the inhabitants of Britain did not paint? And, since Caesar undoubtedly
included among the painted Britons the maritime tribes of the
south-east, and also included them among the Belgae, does he not see the
inconsistency into which he has fallen?</p>

<p><i>Bratuspantium</i>, the name of a Belgic town mentioned by Caesar (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, ii, 13,
§ 2), would to most minds prove that the Belgae spoke a Gallo-Brythonic
dialect, not only by the <i>p</i> which it contains, but also by the <i>nt</i>, a non-Goidelic
combination. Mr. Nicholson, however (<cite>Keltic Researches</cite>, p. 16, with which
cf. A. Holder, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Alt-celtischer Sprachschatz</cite>, i, 515), of course explains the <i>p</i> as
Indo-European.</p></div>

It may be worth mentioning that Professor Rhys has affirmed (<cite>The Welsh
People</cite>, p. 13) that the language of the British Goidels shows more traces of
having been influenced by contact with the language of the non-Aryan aborigines
than that of the Brythons. This fact, if it were a fact, would obviously
be a further argument, if such were needed, against the view that the Goidels
were the latest Celtic invaders of Britain. One expects, of course, to find that
the professor changed this view, which was published in 1900; and accordingly
we read in the address which he delivered in the same year to the British
Association (<cite>Report</cite>, &amp;c., p. 896) that ‘the syntax of insular Brythonic is no
less non-Aryan than that of Goidelic’. Naturally in 1902 (<cite>The Welsh People</cite>,
3rd ed., p. 13) he repeated the former statement.</p></div>

an elaborate study on the word <i>encina</i>, which he had discovered on the pedestal
of a statuette and taken for a Celtic inscription, but which, as M. Gaidoz mercifully
warned him, was simply the name of the engraver, M. Encina, 56, boulevard

Professor Rhys (<cite>The Welsh People</cite>, 1902, pp. 88-9), observing that, according
to Caesar (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, ii, 4, §§ 6-7), Diviciacus, King of the Belgic Suessiones, had
established his hegemony in (Southern) Britain, and (<i>ib.</i>, 3, § 5) that the
territories of the Suessiones and the Remi were practically one, argues that
‘we should expect to find both of them represented in Britain, though their
names have not been detected. Now,’ he continues, ‘we know from ...
inscriptions that a god of the Remi was Camulos’; and he points out that
the name of this god is preserved in <i>Camulodunum</i>, or <i>Colchester</i>, the name of the
chief town of the Trinovantes. The argument is not decisive, because Camulos
was worshipped by other Gallic tribes as well as the Remi, and his name
appears also in that of Camulogenus, a chief of the Aulerci (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, vii, 57, § 3),
who were not Belgae: nevertheless the Professor’s conclusion may be right.</p></div>

‘the Belgae probably occupied the whole of the coast on the east and south ...
from the Isle of Wight to the Firth of Forth’. It is clear therefore that in
1902 the Cantii were ‘considered Belgic’, although in 1884 and in 1904 there
was ‘no evidence’ for this view.</p></div>

The late Professor F. W. Maitland (<cite>Domesday Book and Beyond</cite>, p. 222)
argues that post-Saxon British survivors could not have been very numerous,
as the Celtic language left ‘few traces of itself’; but the same argument might
be used to show that when the Romans came to Britain the Celts were few.

Mr. Alfred Nutt (<cite>Folk-Lore</cite>, xv, 1904, p. 234), commenting on a statement
in Mr. Nicholson’s <cite>Keltic Researches</cite> (p. iv) that Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire
are as Celtic (I should say as pre-Celtic) as South Wales and Ulster,
asks whether it does not ‘demonstrate the absolute futility of statistics of
“relative nigrescence”, or ... size of skulls. The Bucks peasant,’ he continues,
‘may be physiologically akin to the man from Kerry or Glamorganshire;
psychically he differs profoundly.’ Yes, but this does not discredit the
methods of physical anthropology: it only illustrates what I have said in
the text. Between a certain number of individuals in Glamorganshire and
a certain number in Buckinghamshire there is, let us assume, physical kinship:
if we could isolate those two sets of individuals and compare them, instead
of hastily comparing the populations of Glamorganshire and Buckinghamshire
as wholes, we might find that the psychical difference was not as profound as
Mr. Nutt supposes. Probably it would still be noticeable. But why? Partly
because the physical resemblance is combined with a physical difference due
to cross-breeding, the degree and nature of which it would be impossible to
ascertain; partly because the environment, social, geographical, and climatic,
of the peasants of Glamorganshire has for many centuries been very different
from that of Buckinghamshire. Let two plum-puddings be made of identical
sets of ingredients, but in slightly different quantities, in different kitchens,
and by different cooks. The results will be very different. Or suppose that
a thousand Spanish immigrants settled in Britain, and intermarried only among
themselves. At the end of a century their physical and psychical types would
have been modified. Nevertheless, handled with due skill and judgement,
statistics of nigrescence and of cranial measurements retain their value.</p></div>

Mr. Edgar Barclay (<cite>Stonehenge and its Earthworks</cite>, 1895, pp. 40-1, 127-30),
which ascribes the construction of Stonehenge to the time of Agricola, has
been confuted by Professor Haverfield (<cite>Classical Review</cite>, x, 1896, pp. 74-5).
The argument which Mr. Barclay (<cite>op. cit.</cite>, pp. 50-1) directs against the received
view that it was pre-Roman, is based upon the fanciful assumption that it
was designed in accordance with ‘an ancient astrological figure’, which rests
upon the further assumption that ‘all the salient measurements of Stonehenge
may truly be said to result from an observation’ of the sun. His argument
(<i>ib.</i>, p. 88) that ‘we have the testimony of an eye-witness, John Webb, that
an iron spike was dug up near one of the trilithons from a depth of 3 feet’,
and that the circle must therefore have been erected after the close of the
Bronze Age, would hardly impose upon a beginner. There is no evidence that
this ‘spike’ (John Webb, <cite>A Vindication of Stone Heng Restored</cite>, 1665, p. 128)
was made of iron: the circumstances in which it was found are not known;
and, as we shall presently see (p. 477, n. 5, <i>infra</i>), an object manufactured
in the nineteenth century has recently been unearthed within the precincts of
Stonehenge at a depth much greater than three feet.</p></div>

<cite>Nineteenth Century</cite>, June, 1903, p. 1009. I cannot deny myself the pleasure
of quoting Mr. Hinks’s criticism of Sir Norman Lockyer’s argument. ‘The authors
[Sir Norman and Mr. Penrose] are trying,’ he says, ‘to find the place of a prehistoric
sunrise by assuming that the avenue pointed to it. They measured the
direction of the avenue, and found that the measures agreed so very nearly
with the Ordnance Survey measure of the direction of their mark&mdash;presumably
on the highest point&mdash;at Sidbury camp, that they adopted the latter measure
rather than their own; in other words, they agreed that the avenue is directed
very exactly to Sidbury. Henceforward one cannot leave Sidbury out of the
argument.... There are two courses open to us. On the one hand we may
suppose that the avenue was drawn to lead over the down to Sidbury camp,
and had no intentional relation to the place of sunrise. On the other hand
we may suppose that Sidbury is in the sunrise line not by accident but by
design; that it forms an integral part of the solar temple of Stonehenge.
And since the camp occupies the summit of a steep and isolated hill, while
Stonehenge lies on a wide and gently sloping down, it is plain that the camp
end of the Stonehenge-Sidbury line must have been fixed first, and the site of
the temple determined by prolonging the line sunrise-Sidbury till it struck
a suitable place on the down. There is nothing impossible in this; the question
is, Can it be said to be so probable that one is justified in fixing a date for
Stonehenge from the direction of the line so drawn? Which is the greater
improbability, that the Stonehenge-sunrise line was laid out so that it passed
over the peak of Sidbury hill ... so nearly invisible from Stonehenge by reason
of an intervening down that Sir Norman Lockyer thought that the latter formed
the local horizon, and makes no mention of having seen Sidbury over its top ...
or that the line of an avenue setting out from Stonehenge happens to point to
the place where the sun rose at a date which is perhaps as likely as any other
for the foundation of the building...?</p>

<p>‘If preference be given to the first alternative, and we assume that Stonehenge
really was so placed that Sidbury marked the point where the sun rose on
midsummer morning, the question still remains, Was it done so accurately that
it is worth measuring accurately now, and drawing from the measures an exact
statement of date? It <i>may</i> well be objected that in our climate Sidbury is
probably not visible from Stonehenge at sunrise once in twenty years, and that
the likelihood of a long delay in drawing out the plan of so great a work would
very soon have induced the builders to adopt a line near enough for their purposes
though not for ours.... And lastly there is the grave difficulty that everything
depends upon guessing right what is to be considered the critical phase
of the sunrise or sunset,’ &amp;c.</p></div>

Professor Montelius accepts and endorses Sir Norman Lockyer’s conclusions.
Most of the barrows near Stonehenge belong, he says (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Archiv für
Anthr.</cite>, N. F., ii, 1904, p. 140) to the earliest period of the Bronze Age, which,
in the south of England, began, in his opinion, about 2000 <small>B.C.</small> He goes on to
speak of the chippings of the Stonehenge stones which have been found in two
of the surrounding barrows, and affirms that to those who know the epoch to
which Stonehenge belongs it is evident that it was a temple, for sepulchral
monuments ‘have a different appearance’ (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">sahen nicht so aus</i>); and finally
he mentions the results at which ‘some of England’s greatest astronomers
have arrived’.</p>

<p>Alas that a great archaeologist should meddle with what he does not understand!
‘Some of England’s greatest astronomers’ is presumably a rhetorical
synonym for Sir Norman Lockyer: at all events the results which so appeal to
Professor Montelius’s and Sir Norman’s imagination stand to Sir Norman’s
credit alone. Let me recommend the professor to read the article in the
<cite>Nineteenth Century</cite> of June, 1903, in which another astronomer has demolished
them. The only novelty in the professor’s article is the implied statement
that the barrows in which the chippings were found are not much later than
2000 <small>B.C.</small> On this point he is of course entitled to a respectful hearing: but
the mere amateur who remembers that the two barrows in question are assigned
by one of England’s greatest archaeologists to about 300 <small>B.C.</small> will, I fear, shrug
his shoulders; and Mr. Abercromby (see p. 183, <i>supra</i>) has proved that many
of the Wiltshire barrows were later than 800 <small>B.C.</small> The remark that sepulchral
monuments have a different appearance from Stonehenge is not helpful, seeing
that Stonehenge is unique among megalithic circles. I can only repeat that
many such circles have been proved to be sepulchral monuments; and, as
I shall show presently, there is evidence that Stonehenge was a scene of sepulchral
rites.</p></div>

xxxvi, 1902, pp. 131, 579; and Joseph Anderson, <cite>Scotland in Pagan Times:
the Bronze and Stone Ages</cite>, p. 118. As I have already remarked (p. 207,
<i>supra</i>), the date of many English circles remains uncertain; and I admit that
some may be of locally late neolithic age, though I doubt whether any were
erected before the oldest bronze implement was introduced into Southern
Britain. Mr. H. St. George Gray (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, lviii, 1903, pp. 461-98) regards
the well-known monument of Arbor Low, near Bakewell in Derbyshire, as
belonging to ‘the period of transition from stone to bronze’. This circle has
been excavated to a considerable extent. No metal was discovered, nor any
pottery that could be assigned to the period of construction; but a barbed
and tanged arrow-head was found on the bottom of the ditch. Arrow-heads
of this kind were probably first manufactured later than the non-barbed
varieties (see p. 81, <i>supra</i>), although many specimens of the latter were contemporary
with the former. As I have already pointed out, the mere absence
of bronze in a circle is not sufficient to prove that it did not belong to the
Bronze Age: the excavation of Arbor Low was necessarily incomplete; and
all that can be said with certainty is that it is not older than the period to
which Mr. Gray ascribes it. The reasons which he gives (<cite>Man</cite>, vi, 1906,
No. 101, p. 159) for presuming that the Stripple Stones in Cornwall were of
the same date appear to me equally inconclusive.</p>

<p>[I find that Mr. Gray (<cite>Report of ... the Brit. Association</cite>, 1902 [1904], p. 465)
admits that ‘Arbor Low has not been disproved to be of Early Bronze Age
date’, and that his conclusion rests ‘on somewhat meagre evidence’. It has,
however, been pointed out (<i>ib.</i>, p. 466) that ‘a Bronze Age tumulus was certainly
constructed out of material <i>derived from a portion of the original structure</i> of the
earthwork enclosing the stone circle’, and therefore that ‘it is reasonable
to assign the date of construction of the circle to a period <i>not later</i> than the
<i>early</i> Bronze Age’.</p></div>

Professor Gowland (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, lviii, 1902, p. 85) holds that the discovery
of the ‘incense-cup’ proves nothing, ‘as the nature of the ground and the
conditions under which it was found are not given.... In Excavation VI’, he
dryly remarks, ‘I dug up a modern preserved meat tin from a much lower
layer than the stone implements in the neighbouring undisturbed ground.’
Dr. Evans, however, who apparently anticipated this objection, holds (<cite>Archaeol.
Review</cite>, ii, 1889, p. 322), that if the cup had not been originally deposited in the
place where it was found, it would have been broken. I cannot find any
proof that the so-called incense-cup was an incense-cup, in the sense in which
archaeologists use the term, at all. It is described by John Webb (<cite>A Vindication
of Stone Heng Restored</cite>, 1665, pp. 127-8) as ‘the <i>Cover</i> highly probable of
a <i>Thuribulum</i>.... It was of Stone, light in comparison, the more by being
hollow, and extream hard.’ Now incense-cups were not made of stone (though
fragments of stone were often mixed with the clay of which they were baked),
and they hardly ever had covers (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, xliii, 1871, p. 383; W. Greenwell,
<cite>Brit. Barrows</cite>, p. 164, note; <cite>Guide to the Ant. of the Bronze Age</cite> [Brit.
Museum], pp. 61-3). The word ‘Stone’ may have been used incorrectly;
but if the ‘Thuribulum’ was really stone, it was perhaps of late date. Cf.
Sir J. Evans’s <cite>Anc. Stone Implements</cite>, 1897, p. 471.</p></div>

De Mortillet’s identification of the Cassiterides with the islands off the
coast of Brittany is not worth discussing. Tin was apparently worked in the
Morbihan in the Bronze Age (W. Boyd Dawkins, <cite>Early Man in Britain</cite>, pp. 403-4),
but not in any of the Breton islands; nor is there any evidence that Gallic
tin was ever an object of foreign commerce.</p></div>

The theory of Mr. Cecil Torr, who holds that the Cassiterides never existed,
is virtually identical with that of M. Hildebrand. ‘In the Phoenician language’,
he remarks, ‘the word for island is the same as in the Hebrew ... and this word
<span class="rtl">אי</span> is used repeatedly in the Bible for places beyond the sea, as well as ... islands.
Most probably the Phoenicians used this word when speaking of the
Cassiterides, meaning thereby that these were places beyond the sea [which he
identifies with ‘the north-west corner of Spain’]: but the Greeks understood it
in another sense, and thus turned these places into islands’ (<cite>Academy</cite>, xlviii,
Oct. 26, 1895, pp. 342-3). To the objection that Publius Crassus reached the
Cassiterides by sea, Mr. Torr replies that ‘there is nothing to show that his
destination was an island’ (<i>ib.</i>, Nov. 9, p. 390); but Mr. Talfourd Ely (<i>ib.</i>,
Nov. 16, p. 414) pertinently asks whether the word διαβάς, which Strabo uses
in describing the voyage of Crassus, can be used of coasting from one point to
another on the same shore. Moreover, it is absurd to contend that ‘there
is nothing to show’ that Crassus sailed to an island; for Strabo says that the
Cassiterides were ten islands; and Mr. Torr is therefore forced, as we have
seen (p. 488), to make the incredible assumption that Strabo’s account of the
voyage of Crassus is pure fiction.</p></div>

‘The ancient workings for Tin, in the Scilly Islands, are neither deep, nor
many, nor large’ (Wm. Borlase, <cite>Observations on the Ant. ... of ... Cornwall</cite>,
1754, p. 30). [In St. Nicholas Island] ‘we found a row of shallow Tin-pits.... These
are the only Tin Pits which we saw, or are any where to be seen, as we
were informed, in these Islands’ (<i>ib.</i>, <cite>Observations on the ... Islands of Scilly</cite>,
1756, p. 45). ‘Some Tin might have been found in the low grounds washed
down from the Hills.... There may be also Tin-veins in those Cliffs which we
did not visit ... as the <cite>Guêl-Hill</cite> of <small>BREHAR</small>, <cite>Guêl</cite> Island, the name <cite>Guêl</cite> (or <cite>Huêl</cite>)

informed that, under one of the Cliffs of <small>ANNET</small>, there is a Load, in which there
is the appearance of Tin, and that it looks as if it had been work’d’ (<i>ib.</i>, p. 73,

As Sir George Cornewall Lewis pointed out (<cite>Hist. Survey of the Astronomy
of the Ancients</cite>, 1862, p. 452), ‘the Romans ... were not likely to attempt
voyages beyond the Pillars of Hercules before ... 146 <small>B.C.</small>, whereas after that
time the Carthaginians had no ships or factories; Gades had been sixty years
in the hands of the Romans; and ever since the end of the Second Punic War
the Romans had been able to extort the secrets of the Carthaginians.... The
story doubtless originated in the known commercial jealousy of the Carthaginians,’
&amp;c.</p>

<p>M. Salomon Reinach (<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>, x, 1899, p. 400) holds that the Romans
were anxious to ascertain the maritime route to the Cassiterides because it was
cheaper than the overland route. But is it certain that a voyage of more than
2,000 miles would have been cheaper than a land journey of 600?</p></div>

R. Zimmermann, on the contrary, argues (<cite>Hermes</cite>, xxiii, 1888, pp. 121-3) that

See K. Müllenhoff, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche Altertumskunde</cite>, i, 1890, pp. 471-2; H. Berger,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der wissenschaftlichen Erdkunde der Griechen</cite>, iii, 1891, pp. 34-5; and
Pauly’s <cite>Real-Encyclopädie</cite>, iii, part i, 1897, p. 860. Müllenhoff justly remarks
that the account which Diodorus gives in v, 22 of the mode in which the tin
trade was conducted must have been derived from an eye-witness; and that
of all the ancient writers Pytheas was the only one who saw with his own eyes
what went on at Ictis. Professor Ridgeway assumes that Diodorus’s account of
Ictis was borrowed from Posidonius; but the descriptions which Elton (<cite>Origins
of Eng. Hist.</cite>, 1890, pp. 30-1, 34-5, 92) and Professor Rhys (<cite>Celtic Britain</cite>,
1904, pp. 45-6) have published of the visit of Posidonius to Britain are purely
imaginary; for there is absolutely no evidence that he ever crossed the Channel.
Elton refers to a passage in the <cite>Solutiones</cite> of Priscian of Lydia, a writer of the
sixth century (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">quaest.</cite> vi, p. 571 of F. Dübner’s edition), which proves nothing
about Posidonius. See J. Bake, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Posidonii Rhodii reliquiae doctrinae</cite>, 1810;

Professor Rhys (<cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, 1904, p. 45) says that, according to Diodorus,
the tin was brought ‘to the outlet of the Rhone, that is to say, to the meeting
of the Rhone and the Saone’, &amp;c. But πρὸς τὴν ἐκβολὴν τοῦ Ῥοδανοῦ ποταμοῦ
can only mean ‘to the mouth of the Rhône’. Ἐκβολή sometimes means the
issue of a river from a mountainous country: it cannot mean that part of
a river where it is joined by an affluent; and I doubt whether the professor
would seriously maintain that ‘the outlet of the Rhône’ is at Lyons.</p></div>

E. H. Bunbury (<cite>Hist. of Anc. Geogr.</cite>, i, 1879, p. 603, n. 9) remarks that ‘it is
impossible to say what sense we are to attach to the word “introrsus”, upon

<p>Müllenhoff (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche Altertumskunde</cite>, i, 1890, p. 471) holds that Pliny confused

earlier passage (<cite>Nat. Hist.</cite>, ii, 75 [77], § 187), was ‘six days’ sail northward from

The geographical position of Corbilo cannot be fixed. Desjardins (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Géogr.
de la Gaule rom.</cite>, i, 1876, p. 288) was originally inclined to place it near Beslon
in the peninsula of Guérande, because the neighbourhood is ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rempli de souvenirs
celtiques</span>’. Beslon is no more on the Loire than Margate is on the Thames;
and if the tin had been landed there, it would have been necessary either to
tranship it and carry it across the Loire, or to take the pack-horses by a roundabout
route up the valley of that river. Afterwards (<i>ib.</i>, ii, 1878, pp. 139,
484-5, 485, n. 1) Desjardins changed his mind, and identified Corbilo with
St.-Nazaire: ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cet emplacement</span>’, he remarked, anticipating one of the objections
which I have just made against his former view, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cet emplacement
s’accorde-t-il beaucoup mieux que celui de Beslon avec le texte de Strabon, qui
porte cet ancien port sur la Loire, et non sur la mer.</span>’ He relied mainly upon
the investigations of an engineer, M. René Kerviler, who, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ayant eu l’occasion
de faire des travaux d’approfondissement à Saint-Nazaire, y a découvert des
substructions qui avaient fait vraisemblablement partie de l’ancien port de
<cite>Corbilon</cite>.</span>’ See <cite>Rev. arch.</cite>, nouv. sér., xxxiii, 1877, pp. 145-53, 230-9, 342-53.

Mr. Alfred Tylor blunders even more hopelessly than Elton. ‘The transhipment

Mr. Alfred Tylor (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, xlviii, 1885, p. 233) argues, in favour of the
identification of Ictis with the Isle of Wight, that ‘Stans Ore Point is said to be
named from Stannum (tin)’; and Elton (<cite>Origins of Eng. Hist.</cite>, 1890, p. 230)
thinks that ‘the course of the metal-trade may be indicated by the names of
places on the coast-road leading eastward from the Exe, as ... Stans Ore Point’.
Now, as O. Schrader points out (<cite>Prehist. Ant. of the Aryan Peoples</cite>, 1890, p. 217),
<i>stannum</i> probably did not get the meaning of ‘tin’ before the fourth century <small>A.D.</small>;
and even if the derivation in question could be established, it would not prove
that Ictis was the Isle of Wight. Tin was doubtless conveyed eastward from
Cornwall; but not for the supply of the Mediterranean markets.</p></div>

The italics are mine. Müllenhoff (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche Altertumskunde</cite>, i, 1890, pp. 471-2)
asserts that ‘Ictis can only be looked for at the promontory of Belerium’ [the
Land’s End], and that ‘it is undoubtedly one of the small islands off the Land’s
End, which are marked on the Ordnance Map (sheets 32 and 33)’. It must
be presumed that Müllenhoff came to this singular conclusion because Pytheas
landed at Belerium. But there is no reason to suppose that he landed at the
precise spot which we call the Land’s End; and if he did he certainly went on
to visit the tin mines. If Müllenhoff had known the Cornish coast, or even
studied the map carefully, he would have seen that tin could not have been
conveyed in carts down the cliffs opposite the small islands to which he refers,
and that, as Dr. Barham says (<cite>Trans. Roy. Geol. Soc. Cornwall</cite>, iii, 1828, p. 91),
‘there is not ... any other island [besides St. Michael’s Mount] on the Cornish,
or any neighbouring shores to which carts can pass at low water; there is no
other spot, at all answering to the description of Diodorus, which becomes
alternately an island and a peninsula with the changes of the tide.’</p>

<p>George Smith (<cite>The Cassiterides</cite>, p. 114) points out that ‘twelve miles to the
west of St. Michael’s Mount, and eighteen miles to the east of it, comprehend
almost the whole of the ancient tin mining district’. Professor
Rhys, on the other hand, states (<cite>Celtic Britain</cite>, 1904, p. 44) that the tin
districts ‘in ancient times were chiefly Dartmoor, with the country around
Tavistock, and that around St. Austell, including several valleys looking
towards the southern coast of Cornwall’; and he adds that ‘in most of the
other districts where tin existed it is supposed to have lain too deep to have
been worked in early times’. I do not know whether among these ‘other
districts’ he includes the one near St. Michael’s Mount; but it is certain that
the tin in this district was worked in early times. It was the district of Belerium,
where the tin-workers mentioned by Diodorus lived; and he says that there
were veins of tin in the hard rock near the surface (αὕτη δὲ πετρώδης οὖσα διαφυὰς
ἔχει γεώδεις, ἐν αἷς τὸν πόρον κατεργαζόμενοι καὶ τήξαντες καθαίρουσιν [v, 22, § 2].
Cf. Strabo, iii, 5, § 11, and <cite>Ency. Brit.</cite>, 9th ed., vi, 425). Mr. P. W. Flower
(<cite>Hist. of the Trade in Tin</cite>, 1880, p. 26) tells us that from pre-Roman days ‘Cornish
men have been sinking deeper and deeper in their search for cheaper metal’;
while Prof. Haverfield (<cite>Proc. Soc. Ant.</cite>, 2nd ser., xviii, 1900, p. 122), after remarking
that ‘the tin districts of Dartmoor [were] worked largely in the middle
ages’, says, ‘The Dartmoor tin is, I believe, far more difficult to work than the
Cornish, and this fact may explain the Roman neglect of it.’ See also, for
evidence that Cornish tin was won in the Bronze Age, <cite>Archaeologia</cite>, xvi, 1812,
p. 137, pl. 10; xlix, 1885, p. 181; and <cite>Archaeol. Journal</cite>, xxxi, 1874, pp. 53, 60. I
am astonished to find that M. Salomon Reinach (<cite>L’Anthr.</cite>, xvii, 1906, pp. 235-6),
noticing a paper the writer of which maintains that no tin was worked in Britain
until after the date of Domesday Book, says, ‘Cette manière de voir, bien que
contredite par les textes, mérite réflexion.’</p></div>

As Professor Ridgeway assumes that Posidonius was the authority whom
Diodorus followed both in v, 22 and in v, 38, he would be compelled to maintain
that in the passage which served as the basis of the former chapter Posidonius
was describing only the route which the tin trade followed in the time of
Pytheas, in the other that which it followed in his own time. How can the
professor prove this?</p></div>

<i>Ib.</i> What puzzles me is how Professor Haverfield reconciles his view that
in the third century ‘Cornish tin began to take its place as an article of commerce
in Roman Britain’ (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mélanges Boissier</cite>, 1903, p. 251) with his own suggestion
(<i>ib.</i>, p. 250) that ‘either the tin ores had never been so rich as fancy
painted, or the accessible deposits had been worked out [two centuries earlier],
or ... Spanish competition had ousted British tin’. Evidently the accessible
deposits had not been worked out; and British tin must have had superabundant
vitality if it reasserted itself two centuries after it had been ousted.</p></div>

Prof. Haverfield (<cite>Eng. Hist. Rev.</cite>, xix, 1904, p. 746) thinks that ‘the
“Periplus” of Avienus cannot safely be attributed to Himilco’; but M. Camille

the Periplus was <i>ultimately</i> based upon Himilco’s report. Cf. <cite>Rhein. Mus.</cite>,

Altertumskunde</cite>, i, 1890, pp. 93-5) has anticipated a remark which I was about
to make, namely, that the object of Himilco’s voyage was undoubtedly to open
up new markets for trade, and not merely to explore. See also Lord Avebury’s
<cite>Prehist. Times</cite>, 1900, pp. 57-67, though I think that his argument might have
been more valuable if he had taken note of Mr. Borlase’s <cite>Tin Mining in Spain</cite>.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_2415" href="#FNanchor_2415" class="label">2415</a>
Mr. W. C. Borlase (<cite>Tin Mining in Spain</cite>, pp. 24-6), remarking that ‘there
is an extremely rare form of [the palstave], namely with two loops, and that
has been found exclusively in Cornwall and Devon (in the mining districts
especially), in Ireland, and in the western and north-western portion of the
Iberian Peninsula’, and that ‘bronze celts of this class belong ... to ... 1250 to
1050 <small>B.C.</small>’, concludes that ‘at that period then&mdash;the very period to which has
been assigned the foundation of Gades&mdash;Cornwall and the west coast of Spain
were already in communication’. Perhaps; but not necessarily Cornwall and
Gades. Similar celts have also been found in France (J. Evans, <cite>Anc. Bronze
Implements</cite>, pp. 96-7).</p>

<p>Müllenhoff also argues (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche Altertumskunde</cite>, i, 1890, pp. 5-8) that the
passage in the <cite>Odyssey</cite> (x, 81-6) which describes the country of the Laestrygones,
where the days in summer were very long and the nights very short, would
seem to be based upon stories told by Phoenician mariners; but, as I have
already remarked (p. 218), if Homer’s lines were founded upon fact, it is more
probable that the stories came to him from Scandinavia.</p></div>

où la mer pénétrait librement jusqu’au delà de Saint-Omer et où les marais
salants étaient exploités sur les rives de ce large golfe par les Morins et les
Ménapiens.’</span> M. Vaillant gives neither the reference nor the date of the
inscription: it was found at Ariminum in Cisalpine Gaul, and makes mention
of the emperor Vespasian; and it is reproduced in Gruter’s <cite>Inscr. ant. totius

‘Just north of the Isle of Richborough’, says Dowker (<cite>Journ. Brit. Archaeol.
Association</cite>, xl, 1884, p. 272), ‘is a large artificial excavation in the hill. I gave
a description of this when I wrote the account of the ... excavation at the
Castrum; and I drew attention to its being a Roman harbour. It is just
opposite a farm that goes by the name of “Fleet”.’</p></div>

<cite>Itinerary</cite>, 2nd ed., vii, 1744, fol. 127 (p. 116). Professor Burrows may
perhaps have followed Hasted, who says (<cite>Hist. of Kent</cite>, iv, 1799, p. 163) that
‘<i>Upper Deal</i> was composed of the habitations of a few poor fishermen only,
though at a less distance from the sea than at present, owing to the great increase
of beach thrown on this shore afterwards’; and in note <i>e</i> he observes that
‘Leland ... seems to confirm this’. Leland, as I show in the text, does no
such thing. Hasted goes on to say that ‘Even so late as the year 1624, a house ... on
the <i>west</i> side of the <i>Lower Street</i> (the farthest at this time from the sea
shore) is described in a deed of that date to abut <i>ad le sea bank versus orientem</i>’.
Very likely: but the fact does not prove that the west side of Lower Street
was an inch nearer the sea in 1624 than it is now; for the breadth of ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le sea
bank</i>’ is not stated. Anyhow Deal Castle has not moved since 1624: therefore,
if Hasted is right, the sea must then have made a sudden bend landward
immediately north of Deal Castle, and formed a bay; which is absurd. The
west side of Lower Street is now about 550 feet from the high-water mark of
ordinary tides (<cite>Six-Inch Ordnance Survey</cite>, Sheets 58 and 58<small>A</small>).</p></div>

The distance from the ‘high-water mark of ordinary tides’ to the nearest

‘It is certain,’ wrote Dowker in 1876 (<cite>Archaeol. Journal</cite>, xxxiii, 59), ‘that
when the sea swept the Stonar beach, Deal had no existence.’ Even men of
science sometimes use the word ‘certain’ a little rashly. At that time Dowker
asserted that the Stonar beach ‘must have travelled from the cliff between
Dover and Deal’. In 1887 (<cite>Proc. Geologists’ Association</cite>, ix, 174-5) he ‘pointed
to the stones of which it is composed as evincing their origin from the cliff at
Pegwell.... To imagine it to have travelled from the south, we must,’ he said,
‘have a shore-line cutting far back beyond the Deal beach, of which at present
there was no evidence.’</p></div>

Richard Lilburne (<cite>Topographie ... of ... Kent</cite>, 1659, pp. 262-3), alluding to

probable relation of the rise of the same is thus. <i>Goodwin</i> ... was ... owner
of a great quantity of flat Lands in the County (neer the <i>Isle</i> of <i>Thanet</i>) defended
from the sea by a great wall, which lands afterwards (in the year 1099) was
parcell of the possessions of the Abbot of St. <i>Augustine</i> (but reteyned the name
of <i>Goodwin</i> ...), and that Abbot, being then also owner of the Rectory of
<i>Tenterden</i>, and having begun the building of this steeple ... the thoughts, and
actions, of him, and his agents were so set upon the finishing of that work, that
they neglected the care of watching, and preserving the aforesaid wall, and
(3. of November in that year) the sea broke over, and ... drowned the aforesaid
lands (overwhelming the same) with a light sand ... and the place thereby
obteyned the name of <i>Goodwin Sands</i> ... and thus (accidentially) this <i>Tenterden</i>
steeple is said to be the cause of <i>Goodwin Sands</i>.’</p></div>

Dowker (<cite>Twenty-third Report East Kent Nat. Hist. Soc.</cite>, 1881, p. 63) attributed
this loss of shingle to the Admiralty Pier at Dover. ‘The formation
of the Dover Harbour,’ he says, ‘has favoured the accumulation of beach west
of that point; the current, moreover, after passing the obstacle, is deflected
inland, and thus, at St. Margaret’s Bay, a former collection of beach is being
removed towards Deal.’ On the other hand, Sir John Coode, who is described
in the <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite> (Suppl., ii, 52) as ‘probably the most
distinguished harbour engineer of the nineteenth century’, states (<cite>Parl. Papers</cite>,
lviii, 1873, p. 455[3]) that ‘so far from the pier having acted as a check to the
passage of the shingle, there has been a considerable loss to the westward of it
within the last 20 years’. ‘I have no hesitation,’ he adds (<i>ib.</i>, p. 456[4]), ‘in
stating, in the most distinct and positive terms, that this decrease [of shingle
on various parts of the coast south-west of St. Margaret’s Bay] has not been
caused by “the extension of the Admiralty Pier at Dover”, inasmuch as the
various facts that have been brought out in the course of my recent investigation
lead distinctly and unmistakably to the opposite conclusion ... having regard
to the facts previously stated, as to the diminution of shingle to the westward
of Folkestone, near Sandgate and Hythe, &amp;c. ... I have arrived at the conclusion
that this [decrease of shingle between Dover and St. Margaret’s Bay] is due
to the remarkable accumulation of shingle, and consequent projection towards
the south-east of Dungeness’ (<i>ib.</i>, p. 457[5]).</p>

<p>About the year 1721 the supply of shingle was temporarily cut off by the
fall of part of the Castle Cliff. See Capt. John Perry, <cite>Account of the Stopping
of Daggenham Breach</cite>, &amp;c., 1721, p. 119.</p></div>

According to J. B. Redman (<cite>Proc. Inst. Civ. Engineers</cite>, xi, 1851-2 [1853],
p. 164) ‘it appears that at an early period there was no shingle at all at Dover
... which there is historical evidence to prove was the case; its gradual advance
from the westward eventually blocked up the entrance’, &amp;c. Where the
‘historical evidence’ is to be found Redman omits to say; and I cannot find it;
but it is certain that the movement of shingle along the coast began long before
the historic period (<cite>Geogr. Journal</cite>, xxviii, 1906, p. 489).</p>

cliff has receded since those earliest of Roman buildings occupied their present
site’.</p></div>

Experiments recently conducted by Captain McDakin (<cite>Coast Erosion,&mdash;Dover
Cliffs</cite>, pp. 3-4, 12) showed that ‘the average erosion of four years was
unexpectedly small, only amounting to half an inch in a year’. He admits,
indeed, that the average rate, since erosion began, ‘has probably been much
more rapid.’ His general conclusions are, ‘that the heaviest falls ... take
place after long continued rain.... That the springs issuing from the base of
the cliffs play an important part in undermining and bringing down the cliffs;
and that the sea charged with a small amount of shingle [which it discharges
like a gun] attacks the undercliff and removes it, but where the shingle accumulates
in large quantities, it defends and supports the base of the cliffs,’ &amp;c.</p></div>

Lewin observes (<cite>The Invasion of Britain</cite>, &amp;c., 1862, pp. lvii-lviii) that as
far eastward as West Hythe Oaks the shingle ‘fulls’ all curve westward,
having been bent in that direction by the inrush of the tides; while from West
Hythe Oaks to Sandgate they all curve towards the east. This, he says, proves
that when they were formed, the mouth of the estuary near Hythe had already
been closed. Appach, on the other hand (<cite>C. J. Caesar’s Brit. Expeditions</cite>,
p. 21, § 9), does not believe that the shingle spit reached West Hythe Oaks.
Referring to the change of curvature in the shingle fulls, he says that it was
‘evidently due to the cessation of the indraught’, which was ‘obviously caused
by the erection of the ancient wall at West Hythe’. Hence, he concludes, ‘the
fulls to the north of the point [where the change of curvature takes place] ... were
not formed until after the wall at West Hythe was built; and as this is
part of the north-eastern boundary of Romney Marsh, it follows that the fulls
in question were formed after the formation of Romney Marsh.’ Lewin also
mentions ‘the ancient wall at West Hythe’; but his final theory is that the
erection of this dam became necessary because the shingle spit, after it had
reached West Hythe Oaks, was burst by the waters, fed by the streams mentioned
above (p. 532), which accumulated in the space between West Hythe
Oaks and Hythe (see p. 547, <i>infra</i>). Appach holds that Romney Marsh was
not formed until after the Romans had abandoned Britain; and he is therefore
constrained to argue that Hythe Haven did not exist during the Roman occupation,
and that the Portus Lemanis was at Lympne. Both of these theories
will be refuted in this article (pp. 543-8, <i>infra</i>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2572" href="#FNanchor_2572" class="label">2572</a>
It is hardly necessary to point out that Dungeness is of recent formation.
Various theories have been advanced as to its origin (see Mr. F. P. Gulliver’s
paper in the <cite>Geogr. Journal</cite>, ix, 1897, pp. 536-46, and <cite>Proc. Inst. Civil Engineers</cite>,
xi, 1852, pp. 212-21); and attempts have been made to determine the time at
which the oldest of the shingle ‘fulls’ which constitute the ‘ness’ was formed,
by calculating the rate at which the point has advanced seaward since observations
began to be recorded. Elliott remarks (<i>ib.</i>, vi, 1847, p. 476) that ‘from
the best existing data’ Dungeness would appear to extend annually about
two yards further out to sea; and that, as the rate of increase was probably
more rapid at first, we may conclude that about nineteen hundred years have
elapsed ‘since the sea first left the original “full” at Lydd’. According to
Redman (<i>ib.</i>, xi, 1852, p. 174), the increase has not been regular, and ‘during
certain periods the Ness has even been stationary’: from the middle of the
seventeenth to the middle of the nineteenth century, he adds, the average
annual increase was nearly six yards. This is probably an exaggeration.
Sir John Coode (<cite>Parl. Papers</cite>, lviii, 1873, p. 457) ascertained, from particulars
recorded at the Trinity House, that ‘from the year 1792 to 1850 the point
advanced seaward 530 feet, or say, at the rate of 9 feet per annum; whilst
from 1850 to 1871, the advance was 280 feet, or at the rate of from 13 to 14 feet
per annum’. Topley (<cite>Mem. Geol. Survey,&mdash;The Geology of the Weald</cite>, p. 314)
thinks that ‘the oldest fulls are 1,000 years or more old’. Similarly Drew (<i>ib.</i>,
p. 308) says that the shingle which forms Dungeness ‘must have been ...
collected since the Rother first came to Romney’. See also H. J. Mackinder,
<cite>Britain and the British Seas</cite>, 1902, pp. 42-3. ‘In early Roman times,’ he
remarks, ‘Dungeness appears not to have existed’; and he suggests that its
formation was due to ‘the diversion of the Rother mouth for the purpose of
reclaiming Romney Marsh’.</p></div>

It would be a waste of time to catalogue these blunders, which will be obvious
to any one who knows the literature of the subject: but I may remark that
Dowker devotes several pages to a refutation of Elliott’s earlier theory, which
Elliott himself corrected in the notes with which he furnished Lewin; and that
he ignored or was ignorant of Elliott’s matured conclusions. He says (p. 214)
that Elliott’s ‘first paper was written to assist Mr. Lewin ... and his theory
was printed with Mr. Roach Smith’s “History of Further Excavations and
History of the Roman Castrum at Lympne”’. Elliott’s first paper (<cite>Proc. Inst.
Civil Engineers</cite>, vi, 1847) was not written to assist Lewin; nor was his second,
which was printed, not in a book which neither Roach Smith nor any one else
ever published, but as an appendix to Roach Smith’s <cite>Report on Excavations
made on the site of the Roman Castrum at Lymne</cite>, 1852. The notes which Elliott
wrote to assist Lewin were printed in the second edition of Lewin’s <cite>Invasion
of Britain by Julius Caesar</cite>, which appeared in 1862, and which Dowker never
mentions. The unhappy man cannot even refer correctly to his own works.
In his bibliographical note (p. 223) he quotes under his own name a paper
‘On the River Limen’, in <cite>Archaeol. Cant.</cite>, vol. xviii, in which no such paper is
to be found.</p></div>

<p>Mr. H. E. Malden, who believes that Caesar landed somewhere near Hurst,
which is in Romney Marsh, about two miles and a half west of Lympne, affirms
(<cite>Journal of Philology</cite>, xvii, 1888, pp. 176-7, n. 1) that, in <small>A.D.</small> 893, ‘Hastings
the pirate came here with his fleet ... and sailed four miles up the Rother to
the Weald.’ There is not the slightest evidence that ‘Hastings’ came ‘here’
with his fleet. The record of his expedition is in the <cite>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</cite>
(ed. B. Thorpe, ii, 1861, p. 69). ‘In this year’ [893], says the chronicler, ‘the
great army, of which we long before spoke ... came up to the mouth of the
Limen with two hundred and fifty ships. The mouth is in the east of Kent,
at the east end of the great wood which we call Andred.... The river, of which
we before spoke, flows out from the weald. On the river they towed up
their ships as far as the weald, four miles from the outward mouth, and
there stormed a work.’ Mr. Malden (<cite>op. cit.</cite>, p. 176, note) avows his belief
that ‘the Romans embanked the marsh’, and immediately afterwards says
that ‘the <i>Portus Lemanis</i> after that became accessible only from the east,
inside the shingle spit opposite Hythe’. It would appear, then, that, according
to Mr. Malden, the mouth of the Limen, up which the Danes sailed, was ‘opposite
Hythe’. But, according to the <cite>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</cite>, to which he refers, it
was at Appledore (see p. 542, n. 4, <i>infra</i>); and doubtless the Danes reached it
by sailing up the channel, formed by the Rhee wall (see p. 538, <i>supra</i>), which
then connected the Limen with the sea.</p></div>

<cite>Proc. Geologists’ Association</cite>, viii, 1883, p. 93. Topley, indeed, frankly
admits that one argument may be adduced in support of the theory that the
Rother flowed out opposite Lympne. This argument is identical with that
of Drew, which I have quoted in the text; but, as Topley’s exposition is the
more lucid, I give it here. He observes (<cite>Mem. Geol. Survey,&mdash;The Geology of the
Weald</cite>, pp. 303-4) that on Romney Marsh the shingle ‘has chiefly accumulated
to the <i>windward</i> of tidal harbours, whilst the blown sand has accumulated to
leeward of those harbours’; and then, remarking that, on the south of West
Hythe, the ‘fulls’, or ridges of shingle, ‘curve well round to the north-west,
as though to a harbour here,’ and that ‘on the north of this there is again a little
blown-sand’, he admits that these facts lend some support to the popular view:
but, he adds, ‘no trace of the ancient channel is to be found along the northern
side of the marsh.’ But Topley seems not to know his own mind; for he
afterwards says (<i>ib.</i>, p. 304) that ‘it is by no means unlikely that the ancient
Rother had more than one mouth. There may have been one at Lympne, one
at Romney, and one near Rye.’ However, in his final utterance on the subject
(<cite>Proc. Geologists’ Association</cite>, viii, 1883, p. 93) he says, ‘there is no evidence
of any old river along the northern side of the Marsh.’</p></div>

Lewin (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, xl, 1866, pp. 373-4) admits that the earlier of the
two charters mentioned in the text ‘appeared at first sight to negative the
hypothesis that the marsh was under cultivation in the time of the Romans’:
but he adds that he consulted Elliott, who removed his doubts in the following
letter:&mdash;‘The grant refers to <i>Romney</i> and not to <i>Lymne</i>. The boundaries will
do for Romney, but not for Lymne. If at Lymne, the salt-pans must have
been in the marsh, and then on the east, south, and west would have been
the sea, and on the north Lymne Hill. At Romney ... the description agrees.
Sandtun would be the Sand hills, called the Warren, to the east of Romney, and
the boundaries of the land would be as stated, viz.:&mdash;the King’s land on the
east would be the territory to the east, about 100 acres, which was vested in
the Crown until the reign of Elizabeth, when it was granted to Romney Corporation;
the river on the south would be the Limen.... Hudanfleot, referred to as
on the north and west, would be the fleet which may still be traced there,
though it has lost its name,’ &amp;c. Lewin (<cite>The Invasion of Britain</cite>, &amp;c., 1862,
p. lvi) remarks that in the neighbourhood of Romney ‘are still pools of stagnant
water ... called Fleets’. As, however, the mouth of the Limen, in <small>A.D.</small> 893,
according to the <cite>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</cite> (see p. 541, <i>supra</i>) was at Appledore,
we must assume that the Limen mentioned in the charter was simply the body
of water conducted into the channel enclosed within the embankments of the
Rhee Wall.</p>

<p>That ‘the marsh was under cultivation [or, at all events, occupation] in the
time of the Romans’, is not a ‘hypothesis’ at all: it is a fact attested by the
discovery of numerous Roman remains. See p. 551, <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p>Professor Montagu Burrows (<cite>The Cinque Ports</cite>, p. 12) speaks of ‘Hudanfleot,
afterwards called West Hythe’, and says (<i>ib.</i>, p. 50) that ‘Hudanfleot’ means
‘the haven of the estuary’. Needless to say, he gives no authority; and how
‘the haven of the estuary’ could have been both ‘on the west and on the north’
of ‘the piece of land’ referred to in the charters he does not explain.</p></div>

Drew (<cite>Mem. Geol. Survey,&mdash;The Geology of the Country between Folkestone
and Rye</cite>, pp. 19-20), on the other hand, says that ‘Forest trees flourished on
this surface, for the moor-logs in the peat have all the appearance of having
grown on the spot. If this be so, it follows that since that time there has
been a depression of the land, because the peat that occurs at Appledore, and
along the shore between Rye and Dungeness ... is at too low a level for the
plants to have grown at these places while the sea had access there.... There
is no reason to believe that any of the depression of land took place ... from
the time of the Romans downwards, for no human remains nor works of art
have been found deep in the Alluvium.’ Dowker (<cite>Proc. Geologists’ Association</cite>,
xv, 1898, p. 221) argues, in support of Drew’s opinion, that if the trees had
been carried down by the Rother, ‘we should expect them to have been covered
with mud or silt, which does not occur to any extent.’</p></div>

As far as I can see, if the western end of the port had been at West Hythe,
the ‘deluged’ area would have been that between West Hythe Oaks and
Hythe, which in the map prepared by Elliott for Lewin’s book (<cite>The Invasion
of Britain</cite>, &amp;c., 1862, p. liii) is depicted as the western arm of the harbour,
but which in the map that accompanies Lewin’s article on the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Portus Lemanis</cite>

a nominative, but a locative plural, seems to be shown by the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Notitia dignitatum</cite>
(ed. O. Seeck, 1876, Oc. xxviii, 5), where <i>Lemannis castellum</i> is mentioned

It has been argued that <i>commodissimum</i> in this passage means not ‘most
convenient’, but simply ‘very convenient’. I have not the slightest doubt
that the former is the right interpretation, just as in <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, iv, 21, § 3, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">brevissimus</i>
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in Britanniam traiectus</span>) unquestionably means ‘the shortest’, and
not ‘a very short’ (passage to Britain): but if I were wrong my mistake
would be unimportant. It will hardly be denied that if Caesar had found
a port from which the passage was more convenient than from the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Portus
Itius</span>, he would have chosen it. See p. 574, <i>infra</i>.</p></div>

Caignart de Saulcy (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les campagnes de Jules César dans les Gaules</cite>, 1862,
p. 181) infers from this that the Portus Itius must have been so situated that
vessels sailing thence for Dover <i>would have had the north-west wind right in their
teeth</i>; and he remarks that, if Wissant was the Portus Itius, this condition was
fulfilled. But it is hardly necessary to say that the condition is imaginary.
The Portus Itius must have been so situated that while the north-west wind
(or rather the wind called <i>Corus</i>, which may have blown from any quarter
between N.W. and W. by N. ⅓ N.) was blowing, Caesar’s vessels could not have
sailed thence to that part of the Kentish coast which he wished to reach; and
it is certain that they could not sail closer than within about seven points of the
wind. See <cite>The Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul</cite>, by James Smith, 4th ed.,
1880, p. 215; and, on the winds as described by various ancient writers,

J. F. Henry argues (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Essai ... sur l’arrondissement communal de Boulogne-sur-mer</cite>,
1810, pp. 54-5) that Caesar could only have estimated the distance
from the Portus Itius to Britain by making the voyage; that, as he was
carried out of his course on the second voyage, the one by which he estimated
the distance must have been the first; and consequently that in 55 as in 54 <small>B.C.</small>
he must have sailed from the Portus Itius.</p>

<p>But Henry forgot that Volusenus, whom Caesar sent in 55 <small>B.C.</small> to reconnoitre
the British coast, may have made the estimate. Or Caesar may have accepted
the estimate of merchants, of seamen, or of Commius: it is useless to guess.</p></div>

In support of the view that Caesar reckoned the distance to the nearest
port of Britain, Heller (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift für allgemeine Erdkunde</cite>, xviii, 1865, pp. 172-3)
argues (1) that if he had intended to indicate the distance to his landing-place,
he would probably have written, not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">(quo ex portu commodissimum) <cite>in
Britanniam</cite> (traiectum esse cognoverat,</span> &amp;c.) but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad eum locum quo est descensum</i>
(‘to the spot where the disembarkation took place’); (2) that when Strabo
estimated the length of Caesar’s voyage at 320 stades, or 40 Roman miles, he
must either have found (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">milium passuum</span>) <i>XXXX</i>, which is not in any extant
MS., in his copy of the <cite>Commentaries</cite>, or have concluded, from other information,
that Caesar had underestimated the distance; and in either case the fact
that he expressly mentions the time which Caesar took to reach his <i>anchorage</i>
shows that he did not take into account the additional 7 miles which separated
the anchorage from the landing-place.</p>

<p>It will be seen, however, that, although I agree with Heller’s conclusion, the
proofs by which I shall establish the identity of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Portus Itius</span> are wholly
independent of it.</p></div>

<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, xxxiv, 1852, pp. 237-8. I find, to my amazement, that
Desjardins agrees with Airy. ‘The text,’ he argues (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Géogr. de la Gaule rom.</cite>,
i, 360-1), ‘does not say precisely that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Portus Itius</i> is 30 miles from Britain;
it only says (1) that Caesar had ascertained that it was a very convenient port;
and (2) that Britain was about 30 miles from the continent. Here we have
two distinct statements.’</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that Airy, in quoting the passage, omits <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">transmissum</i>,
while Desjardins retains it. It was originally deleted by Faërn, who has been
followed by various editors, in defiance of the <cite>MSS.</cite> See C. E. C. Schneider,

Airy seems to have felt the necessity of bolstering up his argument; for
he remarks (<cite>Essays on the Invasion of Britain</cite>, &amp;c., p. 27) that ‘before the
Triangulation of the year 1787, it was a fair and an insoluble question, whether
the distance from the Continent to Britain was less than twenty or greater
than forty miles’. Perhaps; but long before the aforesaid Triangulation sailors
used to make wonderfully good guesses about this ‘insoluble question’. Cluver
tells us that while staying with Sir Thomas Waller, Warden of the Cinque
Ports, he questioned all who could give him trustworthy information, and
particularly seamen, as to the passages between England and France. The
unanimous reply was that the distance between Dover and Calais was 28 English
miles, and that <i>the most convenient passage was between Dover and Boulogne</i>,
and was 32 English miles (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Germania antiqua</cite>, 1631, lib. ii, cap. xxviii, p. 445).
Similarly, the Arab geographer, Edrisi, who died about 1180, affirmed that
the distance between Wissant and England was 25 Roman miles (<cite>Geogr.
Nubiensis ...</cite>, 1619, pp. 253-4).</p></div>

Creuly also observes (<cite>Rev. arch.</cite>, nouv. sér., viii, 1863, p. 307) that, while
Ambleteuse was 31 Roman miles from Fort Sutherland on Romney Marsh,
Boulogne was 36. But Caesar, as I shall prove (pp. 622-44), did not land on
Romney Marsh; and the futility of arguments of this kind has been already
pointed out (pp. 557-8).</p></div>

It is worth noting that while Creuly pins his faith to Ambleteuse, he is not
so foolish as to ask us to believe that Caesar’s 800 ships found room there.
They anchored, he tells us (p. 310), in the roadstead. But Caesar says expressly
(<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, v, 2, § 3; 5. § 2) that they assembled in the Portus Itius.</p></div>

‘The fact,’ says a writer in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> (Oct., 1900, p. 442),
‘that it was in mediaeval times a “frequented port” is, strictly speaking, not
a fact at all ... the contemporary references to it which have been collected
by French scholars show that it was neither a town nor a harbour, but an open
beach, which travellers in a hurry could use with a favourable wind.’ These
remarks are inaccurate: see p. 580, <i>infra</i>. The mediaeval port, or portlet,
if local tradition is to be trusted, was, however, simply the mouth of the rivulet,
variously called the Rieu de Sombre, Rieu d’Herlan, and Ruisseau du Moulin,
which flows through the modern town of Wissant, enlarged and deepened
(F. A. F. Mariette, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettre à M. Bouillet</cite>, &amp;c., p. 30, n. 20; D. Haigneré, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Étude
sur le Portus Itius</cite>, p. 91); and the tradition has been confirmed by the explorations
of M. Rigaux (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de la Soc. géol. du Nord</cite>, xxviii, 1899, p. 88). In
the dunes which border on the creek formed by the rivulet there have been
found certain old balks of oak, mentioned by Haigneré (<cite>op. cit.</cite>) and C. de Saulcy
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les campagnes de Jules César dans les Gaules</cite>, p. 172), which may have belonged
to the quays of the mediaeval harbour.</p>

<p>According to Le Quien, the inhabitants of Wissant in his time (early in the
eighteenth century) affirmed that the entrance of the harbour had been at the
mouth of the Rieu de Ghibelen,&mdash;the rivulet nearest to Cape Grisnez (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mém. de
litt. tiréz des registres de l’Acad. Roy. des Inscr. et Belles-Lettres</cite>, xiii, 1734-7
[1741], p. 417). I agree with Haigneré that the harbour, such as it was, was at
the mouth of the Rieu d’Herlan. As he says <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Étude</cite>, &amp;c., p. 91),‘Pour s’assurer
de l’endroit où était le port, il n’y avait qu’à se demander où était le village.
Or, le village a toujours occupé l’emplacement sur lequel il est encore bâti de
nos jours, savoir: partie à l’est du <i>ruisseau</i> d’Herlan ... où les maisons se reconstruisent
avec les débris des précédentes,’</span> &amp;c. See also <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bull. de la Soc. de

C. de Saulcy, in an article in which he endeavours to prove that the Portus
Itius was Wissant (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les campagnes de Jules César dans les Gaules</cite>, p. 161), frankly
admits that not one of the natives of Wissant whom he interrogated had ever
heard that there was such a name as ‘Esseu’, or that the Flemings called Wissant
‘Itzen’ (or ‘Isten’). A. Wauters, indeed, referring to B. E. C. Guérard’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cartulaire

the ninth century property in a place called Istem was granted to the abbey
of St. Bertin: but he fails to prove the identity of Istem with Wissant; and
even if that identity could be established, no competent etymologist would
admit that it supplied an argument for identifying Wissant with the Portus
Itius.</p></div>

of Ardres, a chronicler of the thirteenth century, who speaks of <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Britannicum

a writer of the tenth century, calls Wissant <i>Guicsum</i>, he maintains that <i>Guicsum</i>
is identical with <i>Vvicsum</i>, which would mean ‘the port of Sum’, just as
<i>Quantovic</i> (Étaples) means ‘the port of the river Canche’. I agree, however,
with Desjardins (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Géogr. de la Gaule rom.</cite>, i, 352, note) that it is not certain
that by <i>Guicsum</i> Flodoard meant Wissant.</p></div>

Evidently ναύσταθμον had a wider range of meaning than <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">statio navium</cite>.
Plutarch (<cite>Aristides</cite>, 23) implies that a ναύσταθμον could be burned, from
which Haigneré (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recueil hist. du Boulonnais</cite>, iii, 1897, p. 455) infers that ‘un
ναύσταθμος n’est pas une rade foraine, ni une anse, mais un lieu fermé, où
se trouvent des arsenaux maritimes’. This was sometimes the meaning of the
word, but only rarely. Pliny (<cite>Nat. Hist.</cite>, iii, 8 [14], § 89) mentions a harbour
in Sicily, called Portus Naustathmus. See also Stephanus, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thesaurus Graecae

region of the Itian highland in which Caesar had his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">portus Itius</i> and his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior

It is quite true, as General Creuly observes (<cite>Rev. arch.</cite>, nouv. sér., viii,
1863, p. 306) that the author of <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bellum Africum</cite> (c. 10, § 1) applies the name
of <i>portus</i> to a mere anchorage (cf. Col. Stoffel, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de Jules César,&mdash;Guerre
civile</cite>, ii, 110-1, and pl. 20). But <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bellum Africum</cite> was not written by Caesar;
and the question is, what Caesar meant by the word <i>portus</i>. Now there are
certainly two instances in which he applies that word to a harbour very different
from the estuary of a river. The harbour of Nymphaeum (now the bay of
Medua) on the eastern coast of the Adriatic has a comparatively wide entrance,
and is exposed to the full force of the south wind; but against all other winds
it is perfectly safe, and it might fairly be called a <i>portus</i> and not a <i>statio</i>
(<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Civile">B. C.</abbr></cite>, iii, 26, § 4. Cf. Col. Stoffel, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de Jules César</cite>, &amp;c. pl. 14 <i>bis</i>). The
harbour of Alexandria was formed, as Caesar says (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Civile">B. C.</abbr></cite>, iii, 112, § 2. Cf.
Stoffel, pl. 19), by the island which extended opposite the city, and was
divided into two portions by the mole which connected the island with the
mainland: the western portion must have been exposed to south westerly
winds, but the other offered complete shelter. The conclusion is that the
word <i>portus</i> had a somewhat elastic signification, but would not have been
applied by Caesar to Wissant unless the anchorage there had been protected,
as Dr. Guest imagined, by sand-dunes.</p></div>

the Tour d’Odre stood during the two centuries and a half that preceded the
year 1810, that in Caesar’s time they must have extended from 700 to 800 metres
further seaward than in 1810. This, however, I believe to be an exaggeration.</p></div>

iv, 87-90) attempts to prove that Ptolemy confused two itineraries, and
accordingly located the promontory between the Somme and Gesoriacum
instead of on the north of the latter.</p>

<p>Henry (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Essai ... sur l’arrondissement communal de Boulogne-sur-mer</cite>, pp. 3-6,
33), referring to Pomponius Mela (iii, 7, §§ 59, 68), maintains that by the word
<i>promontorium</i> the ancients sometimes designated not merely a cape but also
all its ‘collateral dependencies’; and accordingly he argues that the Ἴτιον
ἄκρον comprised Capes Grisnez and Blancnez, and Cap d’Alprech!</p>

<p>Desjardins (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Géogr. de la Gaule rom.</cite>, i, 371-2) remarks that not only was Cap
d’Alprech a more prominent headland 2000 years ago than to-day, but it is
actually 9 metres, or about 30 feet, higher than Cape Grisnez; and he insists
that the ancients, being unable to form an exact idea of the outline of a coast,
took note of those geographical features which appeared to them remarkable,
and would therefore have been more inclined to mention Cap d’Alprech than
Cape Grisnez. I cannot help thinking that Desjardins would not have resorted
to this argument if he had not persuaded himself that the identification of the
Portus Itius with Boulogne depended upon the identification of Cap d’Alprech
with the Itian promontory. The ancients did not know how to make accurate
maps; but they had sufficient powers of observation to be able to see that
Cape Grisnez marked the great bend in the coast of North-Eastern Gaul.</p>

<p>It is amusing to find that, whereas Desjardins in his first volume (p. 371)
affirmed that the identification of the Itian promontory with Cape Grisnez,
if it were admitted, would necessarily involve the identification of the Portus
Itius with Wissant, in his third volume (p. 355) he queries his own identification
of the promontory with Cap d’Alprech.</p></div>

that he was carried too far north and past the place where he had landed the

<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift für allgemeine Erdkunde</cite>, xviii, 1865, pp. 122-3. There is an
obvious objection to this argument, to which Heller replies by anticipation.
One of the three sides of Britain, says Caesar, looks southward towards Gaul;
and one of the ‘angles’ (<i>alter angulus</i>) of this side is by Kent (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, v, 13, § 1).
If Caesar landed, as Heller believes, between the South Foreland and the North
Foreland, he had himself seen this angle, which is formed by the South Foreland;
and if he believed that the coast, at the North Foreland, turned sharply
towards the west, and had no knowledge of that part of the coast which trends
northward beyond the mouth of the Thames, it is clear that he must have
regarded the North Foreland and not the South Foreland, as marking the
commencement of the northern side, in which case one might think that he
would have described the coast between the South Foreland and the North
Foreland as a separate side, and would have represented Britain not as triangular
but as irregularly quadrilateral. But Heller argues that the word <i>angulus</i>, as
used by Caesar, does not mean an ‘angle’ in the geometrical sense of the
word, but only a strip of coast between two angles; and he compares a passage
in Livy’s description of the siege of Saguntum (xxi, 7, § 5),&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Angulus muri
erat in planiorem patentioremque quam cetera circa vallem vergens</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2813" href="#FNanchor_2813" class="label">2813</a>
Caesar started ‘about sunset’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad solis occasum</i>): the wind dropped
‘about midnight’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">media circiter nocte</i>); and the drift ceased at daybreak
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">orta luce</i>). The sun set at 8.16 p.m.; and day broke about 3.20 a.m. It
would be absurd to suppose that the voyage must have begun at the moment
when the sun dipped under the horizon: we may fairly assume that it began
at any time between 7 and 8. Similarly the drift may be assumed to have
begun at any time between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. Let us suppose that the wind
lasted 5 hours, and the drift 3 hours. For some time before the wind
dropped it must have been gradually dying down; but, as the vessels kept
steerage way, it may be assumed, so Captain Iron, the harbour-master at
Dover assures me, that, even during the drift, there was not a dead calm.
Major Rennell, indeed, affirms (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, xxi, 1827, p. 503) that when the
wind dropped the ships were ‘left to the resources of their oars’: but Caesar
does not confirm this; and if the oars had been used, why should the ships
have drifted out of their course? Captain Iron says that with a light south-westerly
wind the ships could easily have sailed 6 knots an hour. The voyage
took place about the time of new moon (see pp. 728-30, <i>infra</i>), that is to say,
a day or two before spring tide. For the first two hours the ships had to
encounter the ebb tide, the rate of which, however, was not more than one knot
an hour; and the flood, the rate of which increased from about three-quarters
of a knot to nearly 3 knots, helped them from about 9 or 9.30 p.m. We may
estimate, then, that in the 5 hours they sailed not less than 25 knots; while in
3 hours, aided by a faint breeze, they would have drifted about 6 knots (see
p. 656, <i>infra</i>). I think, then, that the entire distance which Caesar sailed up to
the moment when he ‘saw Britain lying behind on the port quarter’, may be
estimated at not less than 31 knots, or about 57½ kilometres. After making
this calculation, which must be taken for what it is worth, I find that, according
to Napoleon’s map (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de Jules César</cite>, Atlas, pl. 16), the distance was
57 kilometres. The reader may check my estimate by referring to the
Admiralty <cite>Tide Tables</cite>, pp. 112-9, and <cite>Tidal Streams, English and Irish
Channels</cite>.</p></div>

For this reason I attach no importance to Heller’s remark (<cite>Philologus</cite>, xlix,

of Deal, he would have written, not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub sinistra Britanniam relictam conspexit</i>,

Long forgets that Strabo does not expressly say that ‘the Itius’ was
a usual point of transit; he only says that Caesar used it as his naval station.
If ‘the Itius’ was identical with the port used by the passengers who ‘cross
from the country near the Rhine’, it was ‘a usual point of transit’; but it is
precisely this identity which is the subject of dispute.</p></div>

On the day of Caesar’s first landing in Britain high water at Dover was
about 6.21 a.m. (see pp. 610-1, <i>infra</i>); and when he was approaching the British
coast in 54 <small>B.C.</small>, the tide turned south-westward about ten miles east of Deal
soon after daybreak, which was about 3.15 a.m. See pp. 655-9, <i>infra</i>. Supposing
that Caesar landed in Britain in 55 <small>B.C.</small> on the 27th, not, as I believe
(see p. 601, <i>infra</i>), on the 26th of August, it still remains true that the latter part
of the voyage was made on the flood.</p></div>

Cape Grisnez would equally have afforded Wissant ‘something like a shelter

One of these, known as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voie de Leulene</i>, leads from Thérouanne to Sangatte,
and, near Guines, throws out a branch, which terminates at Wissant; the

I say ‘at least’ advisedly. In order to understate my case, I have assumed
that the legions were of the exceptionally low average strength of 3,500 men
(<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, v, 49, §7; Rice Holmes, <cite>Caesar’s Conquest of Gaul</cite>, pp. 563-7), and have
not counted auxiliaries, although there were certainly both slingers and
archers (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, iv, 25, §1). Probably we should be within the mark if we estimated
the force at 40,000 infantry and auxiliaries, besides the 4,000 cavalry.</p></div>

impossible to account for the fact that, on the return voyage, two of his ships
failed to make the same harbours as the rest, that is to say, Sangatte and
Wissant. Those two ships could not, he insists, have drifted further down the
coast, that is to say, southward of Cape Grisnez, unless the wind had been unfavourable;
and if the wind was unfavourable, how was it that the remaining
ships succeeded in making the harbours? Captain Iron, however, attaches
no importance to this objection.</p></div>

I mean, of course, on any part of the coast which can be regarded as lying
within the limits required by Caesar’s narrative. The estuary of the Authie
is about 11 miles further south than that of the Canche; and the estuary of
the Somme is, as we have seen (pp. 558-63, <i>supra</i>) inadmissible.</p></div>

la munificence du gouvernement ... a doté le port de Boulogne ... les ouvriers
arrivèrent dans la couche la plus basse des sables qu’ils déblayaient dans la
fouille! Nous y trouvions le radier de l’ancien port semé d’antiquités gauloises

p. 236) that Boulogne harbour would have been too small for Caesar’s purpose,
neglected to inform himself that there was much more space in the estuary in
Caesar’s time than there is now.</p>

<p>Henry’s objection (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Essai ... sur l’arrondissement communal de Boulogne-sur-mer</cite>,
pp. 58-9), that there would not have been enough water in the harbour
at sunset, when Caesar set sail on his second voyage, therefore collapses; but
even if his statement were true, the inference which he draws from it would
be refuted by himself: for he tells us (p. 52) that in 55 <small>B.C.</small> the ships ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ont dû

much less.</p>

<p>Mariette (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettre à M. Bouillet</cite>, &amp;c., pp. 16, 51) actually holds that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior
portus</i> was the harbour of Bononia (see p. 591, n. 1, <i>infra</i>), as distinguished
from that of Gesoriacum! The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i>, he says, is generally assumed
to have been eight Roman miles from the Portus Itius, simply because the
eighteen ships which carried Caesar’s cavalry were detained eight miles from
the Portus Itius by contrary winds. But, he insists, Caesar does not say that
the place where the eighteen ships were detained was a harbour: he merely
indicates the harbour where the cavalry embarked, without saying where it
was; it was not the same place as that at which the vessels had been detained
some days before.</p>

<p>I only notice this theory because Mariette was a really eminent man. If it
were necessary to refute it, it would be sufficient to say, first, that, as Caesar
tells us (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, iv, 22, § 4) that the eighteen ships (which he reserved for his
cavalry) were detained by contrary winds at a place eight miles from the
harbour which sheltered the rest of the fleet, and in the next sentence but
two says that he ordered the cavalry to advance to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i> (which
he had not mentioned before), and embark, the inevitable conclusion is that
the place where the eighteen ships had been detained was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i>;
secondly, that if the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulterior portus</i> had been virtually in juxta-position with
the port from which Caesar sailed, he would certainly have taken care that
they sailed along with him.</p></div>

therefore Wissant was the <i>portus Morinorum Britannicus</i> of Pliny! He forgets
that Lambert was not referring to the time of the Roman Empire: he simply

England.</p>

Napoleon III (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de Jules César</cite>, ii, 171-2) maintains that the fact of
the great Napoleon’s having selected Boulogne for the embarkation of the
troops with which he intended to invade England is a strong argument in
favour of Caesar’s having done the same. I lay no stress upon this argument
because it is superfluous if it can be shown that Wissant would not have served
Caesar’s purpose equally well; and that this has been shown those who have
read so far will not deny. It is hardly necessary to add that Boulogne was
only one, though the principal, of several ports selected by Napoleon.</p></div>

Desjardins also finds it necessary to explain why the name <i>Gesoriacum</i> was
succeeded by <i>Bononia</i>. His explanation (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Géogr. de la Gaule rom.</cite>, i, 373) is
that the port of Gesoriacum was different from the port of Bononia. Remarking
that, according to Eumenius (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paneg. Constantii</cite>, c. vi), the port of
Gesoriacum was blocked by the emperor Constantius Chlorus, in order to
prevent the escape of Carausias, he says that ‘sans doute’ this port was then
abandoned for the new (and hypothetical) port of Bononia, ‘aux Tintelleries,’
further down the Liane. This, he says, explains why the name Bononia
was alone used (except in the itineraries) after the time of Constantine.
I have noticed that Desjardins uses the words ‘sans doute’ when there is
a doubt which he is unable to remove. As he insists that the ports of
Bononia and Gesoriacum were different, he must, I think, have been off his
guard when he quoted, in support of his contention, an anonymous writer,
who mentions the arrival of Constantine at ‘Bononia, which the Gauls originally
called Gesoriacum’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bononiam, quam Galli prius Gesoriacum vocabant</i>
[M. Bouquet, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recueil des hist. des Gaules</cite>, i, 1738, p. 563<small>B</small>]). And in his own
edition of the Peutinger Table (p. 13, col. 2) I find the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesogiaco quod nunc
Bononia</i>.</p></div>

to ‘the middle of Britain’ (εἰς μέσην τὴν Βρεττανικήν) is 5,000 stades,
and (ii, 1, §40) that the distance from Carthage to Massilia is not more than

even if they could be interpreted as meaning a creek or inlet hemmed in by
precipitous heights, they could not apply to ‘old Dover harbour’, which

‘being unfavourable to them’: but, assuming that this is the meaning, did
Caesar intend to convey that the ships stood out to sea <i>though</i> night was
unfavourable to the voyage, or <i>because</i> night was unfavourable to their remaining
where they were? I unhesitatingly reject the former alternative, for all
Caesar’s voyages between Gaul and Britain were made by night, and, moreover,
on this particular night there was a full moon: on the other hand, it would
not have been more dangerous to remain at anchor in the night than in the daytime.

Napoleon III (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de Jules César</cite>, ii, 175), after citing two irrelevant
passages, asserts that ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">post diem quartum</cite> de César doit se comprendre dans
le sens de quatre jours révolus, sans compter le jour du débarquement</span>’; and
then, remarking that the storm broke out on the 30th of August, he concludes
that ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quatre jours pleins s’étaient écoulés depuis le débarquement; cela nous
conduit au 26. César prit donc terre le 25 août.</span>’ To make things perfectly
clear, let us put the matter in this way:&mdash;the orthodox view is that, according
to the <i>common</i> Roman method of reckoning, the fourth day after Monday
would be Thursday; Napoleon’s view is that it would be Saturday! It is
neither profitable nor exciting to slay the slain. I will therefore only remark
that Napoleon’s interpretation of the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post diem quartum</i> is peculiar to
himself, and that it has been demolished by Merivale (<cite>Contemporary Review</cite>,
iii, 1866, pp. 125-6) and, still more effectively, by Heller (<cite>Philologus</cite>, xxvi,
1867, pp. 674-6).</p>

<p>Long (<cite>Decline of the Roman Republic</cite>, iv, 169), remarking that ‘the Romans
sometimes reckoned inclusively and sometimes not’, concludes that ‘the expression
“on the fourth day” is ambiguous’. The famous jurist, F. C. von Savigny
(<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">System des heutigen römischen, Rechts</cite>, iv, 1841, pp. 602-16), collected a large
number of examples of both methods, which both Merivale and Heller have
overlooked; and L. Holzapfel (see p. 719, n. 1, <i>infra</i>) shows that Cicero often
used the exclusive method, which, for numbers from ten upwards, appears
to have been invariable (Th. Mommsen, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die röm. Chron. bis auf Caesar</cite>, 2nd ed.,
1859, p. 163, n. 17, and L. Holzapfel, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Röm. Chron.</cite>, 1885, p. 353). Those,
however, who are familiar with the language of the <cite>Commentaries</cite> will have no
difficulty in concluding that Caesar himself, in that work, used the inclusive
method. In <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, vi, 33, § 4, he writes, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">discedens post diem VII sese reversurum
confirmat</cite>; and in vi, 35, § 1, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">diesque adpetebat VII quem ad diem Caesar ...
reverti constituerat</cite>. Therefore, as Merivale observes, ‘<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies VII = post diem VII</cite>.’

It is remarkable that most of the writers who have dealt with the question
of Caesar’s landing-place should have taken so little pains to inform themselves
about the tides. Thus Cardwell, who was in 1860 Camden Professor of Ancient
History at Oxford, says that ‘If you know what was the time of high-water
at Folkestone at any full moon during the present year, you know the time
of high-water at the same place whenever the moon was full a hundred or
a thousand years ago. It is also a fact that each successive tide is later by
twenty-five minutes than the one which had preceded it’ (<cite>Archaeol. Cant.</cite>, iii,
1860, p. 7). Both these statements are grossly inaccurate, as the professor
might have seen if he had taken the trouble to devote half an hour to the study
of the <cite>Admiralty Tide Tables</cite>. Thus, taking the August full moon of the
years 1883-1900, the time of high tide at Folkestone varied between 11.5 a.m.
in 1896 and 10.17 a.m. in 1900; while the time of high tide of the fifth day before
the full moon varied between 6.21 a.m. in 1893 and 4.46 a.m. in 1898; and
high tide on the morning of August 19, 1896, was 90 minutes later than high
tide on the morning of August 18, not 50 minutes, as it should have been
according to Cardwell. If he had said that ‘<i>on the average</i> each successive tide
is later by twenty-five minutes than the one which had preceded it’, he would
have told the truth.</p></div>

the turn of the stream. I am willing to make any reasonable allowance; but

According to Falconer’s Marine Dictionary, 1815, p. 220, the lee-way of a
ship in a gale varies from 5½ to 6½ points. The amount of course depends upon
the force of the gale, the build of the ship, and other circumstances.</p></div>

I need hardly say that if Caesar’s transports had been anchored off Pevensey
on the night of the full moon a north-north-easterly gale could not have driven
them ashore unless they had been inside the harbour, which Caesar would
have mentioned.</p></div>

Lewin (<cite>The Invasion of Britain</cite>, &amp;c., 1862, pp. xxxii-xxxiii) points out that
if Caesar approached the British coast anywhere near Pevensey, ‘he must have
anchored, in the first instance, somewhere off the high cliffs between Hastings
and Cliff’s End,’ because at no point between Hastings and Pevensey are the
‘precipitous heights’ off which he anchored to be found. But, continues
Lewin, if he anchored at any point between Hastings and Cliff’s End, ‘eight
Roman miles would not carry him so far as Pevensey Marsh.’ [For ‘eight’
read ‘seven’.]</p></div>

When Professor Ridgeway resuscitated Airy’s theory, he found himself
called upon to meet the objection which we have just considered. Mr. Malden
(<cite>Journal of Philology</cite>, xix, 1891, pp. 197-8) told him that Caesar would never
have landed ‘opposite the Great Wealden Forest, where resistance would be
easy and supplies scarce’. The professor replied (<i>ib.</i>, p. 206) that a passage
in Caesar’s narrative proves that he <i>did</i> land opposite the Wealden Forest.
The passage will be found in the ninth chapter of Caesar’s Fifth Book, in which
he describes the combat which took place on the banks of a stream, about
12 miles from his camp, the day after his second landing. The Britons, on
being driven from the banks, withdrew into woods (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">repulsi ab equitatu se in
silvas abdiderunt</i>). Mr. Malden (<cite>Journal of Philology</cite>, xx, 1892, p. 63) makes
the obvious reply:&mdash;‘All that Caesar tells us is that there were woods in which
the Britons took refuge ... but Caesar does not lead us to believe that he
landed in a place where his march inland was barred by an all but impenetrable
forest 30 to 40 miles wide.’</p></div>

Caesar’s men certainly did not begin to row at 3 a.m. Daybreak did not
occur before 3.15; and, as Mr. Peskett remarks (ib., xx, 1892, p. 198), ‘the
starting on the right course with the turn of the tide of a large and probably
somewhat scattered fleet is not a momentary act which you can assign to
a particular minute of the day.’</p></div>

The professor denies that Caesar’s men could have taken all the time
from daybreak to noon to row with the tide from a point off the South Foreland
to Romney Marsh; and, on the assumption that they landed on the eastern
end of the marsh, he is unquestionably right. But there is no evidence that
they began to row at daybreak (see p. 620, n. 3, <i>supra</i>): we are not obliged to
assume that because <i>all</i> the ships, including stragglers, had reached Britain
by about noon, rowing went on in all till twelve o’clock; and the professor
would have done better to conclude, not that they rowed to Pevensey, but that
they drifted as far as the latitude of Deal, and rowed to a point on the eastern
coast of Kent.</p></div>

This statement, as Caesar’s narrative (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, iv, 26, § 5) shows, is incorrect;
and Lewin himself corrects it when he says (p. xlvii) that on the day of Caesar’s
first voyage ‘the eighteen transports ... set sail, according to orders, but had
been forced to put back by stress of weather’.</p></div>

Lewin afterwards saw that if Caesar landed at Hythe, he could not have
anchored off Dover, and accordingly transferred his anchorage to a point off
Folkestone. See p. 635, <i>infra</i>.</p></div>

Schneider maintains (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Comm. de bellis C. I. Caesaris</cite>, ii, 45-6) that ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">molle
idem esse quod leniter acclive, imprimis apto exemplo demonstravit Heldius,
7, 46, <i>ad molliendum clivum</i> non aliter dictum docens</span>’. I do not think that
Schneider is right in arguing that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mollis</i> should be <i>translated</i> by ‘gently
sloping’, though that meaning is doubtless implied. My friend, Professor
Postgate, who agrees with me, has kindly referred me to a passage in Ovid
(<cite>Ep. ex Ponto</cite>, i, 2, 61-2)&mdash;

<span lang="la" xml:lang="la" class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Cum subit Augusti quae sit clementia, credo</i></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Mollia naufragiis litora posse dari&mdash;</i></span>
</span></span></p>

<p>which seems to justify my explanation. Professor Postgate has also written
me a most interesting letter, in which he remarks that while <i>aperto</i> describes
the approach to the shore, which was not blocked by rocks, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">molli</i> connotes
both a gentle slope and a soft surface: he refers to a passage in Pomponius
Mela (i, 19, § 102), where the Black Sea is described as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non molli neque
harenoso circumdatus litore</i>.</p></div>

Furley (<i>ib.</i>, p. 13, n. *) has noted this objection. Lewin would perhaps

land there if the Britons were friendly, and otherwise to sail either to Deal or
Bonnington; that he was ‘of course completely ignorant of the turn of the
stream in the Channel’; that while he was at anchor he gave orders for a landing
at Deal; but that when the stream turned westward he changed his mind
and issued new orders for a landing at Bonnington! Appach failed to see
that since Caesar, when he was at anchor, saw how the stream was running,
Volusenus could have done the same. To say that Caesar was ‘completely
ignorant’ is to assume that Volusenus was a fool. Besides, did not Caesar’s
Gallic seamen know the Channel by heart?</p></div>

Caesar’s landing-place was, the expression <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub sinistra</i>, coupled with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Britanniam

Iulius Caesar ... venit ad Brittanniam cum sexaginta ciulis, et tenuit

(<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chronica minora</cite>, ed. Th. Mommsen, iii, 1898, p. 162). Besides <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apud</i>
there is another reading, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contra</i>; and one <i>MS.</i> has <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dorobellum</i> instead of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dolobellum</i>. Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his fabulous account of Caesar’s first
invasion (<cite>Hist. Brittonum</cite>, iv, 3), says that ‘Cassibellaunus’ came <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad Dorobellum
oppidum</i>. It is not surprising that an uneducated writer like S. Pritchard
(<cite>Hist. of Deal</cite>, pp. 1, 10, 39) should assure his readers that Caesar called his
landing-place <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dola</i>; but when a scholar like Dr. Guest (<cite>Archaeol. Journal</cite>,
xxi, 1864, p. 242) gravely points to ‘the use of the phrase “apud dolo”’ in the
Vatican <cite>MS.</cite> of Nennius, and argues that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dolo</i> means Deal, I am amazed. The
reading <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dolo</i> is not so much as mentioned in Mommsen’s <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">apparatus criticus</cite>;
but let us provisionally accept it, and then consider how Dr. Guest would have
construed the passage:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iulius Caesar ... pugnabat apud Dolo, qui erat proconsul
regi Brittannico</i> &amp;c. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dolo</i>, says Dr. Guest, means Deal; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dolo</i>, says
Nennius, was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proconsul</i>, or commander-in-chief, under the British king.
Whatever Nennius may have written, it is clear that he believed Caesar to
have landed somewhere on the north of the South Foreland, and probably
on the coast of East Kent; for, as Battely pointed out (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antiquitates Rutupinae</cite>,
1711, p. 46), the mouth of the Thames, in which Nennius places the landing,
had a wider signification in the Middle Ages than it has now; and William
of Malmesbury (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De gestis Pontificum Anglorum</cite>, ed. N. E. S. A. Hamilton, 1870,
lib. ii, § 73 [p. 140]) actually made it extend as far as Dover.</p></div>

Paris (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chronica Majora</cite>, ed. H. R. Luard, pp. 72-4), who seems to have copied
Geoffrey’s amusing fable, Caesar landed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in ostium Tamensis fluminis</i> on the

the weather was good.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3222" href="#FNanchor_3222" class="label">3222</a>
It is possible that the reason why Caesar approached Britain a little eastward
of Dover harbour was that he intended to run into the harbour on the ebb,
or westerly-going stream. Long (<cite>Decline of the Roman Republic</cite>, iv, 438), like
Appach, fatuously remarks that Caesar ‘was ignorant of the turn of the stream
in the Channel’. See p. 641, n. 1, <i>supra</i>.</p></div>

See pp. 605-11, <i>supra</i>. Heller (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift für allgemeine Erdkunde</cite>, xviii,
1865, pp. 116-25), after an elaborate argument, which, if his premisses are
correct, is unanswerable, arrives at the conclusion that, assuming high water
to have occurred at Dover on the 27th of August, 55 <small>B.C.</small>, at 7.31 a.m., the stream
off Dover turned between 4.26 and 5.21 p.m.; and that, as the turn must have
been accelerated by the favourable wind which Caesar mentions (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, iv, 23,
§ 6), ‘one may say, without fear of error, that the stream turned at 4.26 p.m.’:
but it is unnecessary to examine his argument, because he was not acquainted
with the results of the observations which, as we have seen, were made in 1862
by Surveyor Calver.</p>

<p>Neither have I taken any notice of the argument by which the late Professor
Cardwell (<cite>Archaeol. Cant.</cite>, iii, 1860, pp. 14-7) endeavoured to prove that if
high tide had occurred at Dover on the day of Caesar’s landing at 7.31 a.m.,
he must at 3 p.m. ‘have gone up Channel on the first of the flood and proceeded
to the eastward’; for the evidence upon which the professor relied has been
shown by Airy (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>, xxxix, 1863, pp. 304-6) to have been misleading.</p></div>

<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift für allgemeine Erdkunde</cite>, xviii, 1865, p. 127. Heller’s argument
may be summarized as follows:&mdash;Caesar does not say that he weighed anchor
in the ninth hour; had he done so, he would not have used the words ‘weighing
anchor’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sublatis ancoris</i>) in the later passage in which he describes how he
quitted his anchorage: he only says that he waited at anchor till the ninth
hour for the overdue ships. Meanwhile, as he tells us, he issued his orders to
the officers of the vessels which had already arrived; and, as orders had also
to be given to the captains who were late in arriving, and they were obliged,
after receiving their orders, to get back to their ships, delay was inevitable.
That the turn of the stream did not take place until after the ninth hour is
to be inferred from Caesar’s having used the words (His dimissis et ventum et
aestum) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uno tempore</i> (nactus secundum), which refer only to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et ventum et aestum</i>
(<cite>Philologus</cite>, xxii, 1865, p. 308).</p>

<p>Dr. Guest (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Origines Celticae</cite>, ii, 347, note) puts the matter well. ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In anchoris
exspectare dum</i> can only,’ he observes, ‘mean, to wait at anchor for the happening
of the event. If we add the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad horam nonam</i>, surely we make the
ninth hour the limit, not of lying at anchor, but of waiting for the event....
Caesar probably steered for Dover with the view of landing his men as the
vessels came in, but finding his landing opposed, he awaited the arrival of his
other vessels <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in anchoris</i>, <i>i.e.</i> in the roadstead. The emphasis [laid on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
anchoris</i>] marks the change of plan occasioned by the unexpected opposition
he met with.’</p></div>

Lewin, indeed, objects (<cite>The Invasion of Britain</cite>, &amp;c., 1862, p. xci) that
‘had another interval of two hours occurred [after the ninth hour] Caesar
could not fail to have mentioned it’. But, in the first place, as the reader will
have seen, it is unnecessary to assume that the interval lasted as long as two
hours, or even one; and, in the second place, there was no reason why Caesar
should mention it, except for the benefit of stupid readers, whom he invariably
left to their own devices. Some interval there must have been unless the
captains of the laggard ships were left without the instructions which had
been given to the rest.</p></div>

If, then, he really did weigh anchor in the ninth hour, and if in the ninth
hour the stream was running down the Channel on the 26th of August, he must
have landed on the 25th; and it has been shown (p. 600-3, <i>supra</i>) that he may
have done so.</p></div>

George Long, who was a very able man, was nevertheless capable, if hard
pressed in controversy, of writing sheer nonsense. Having only the most
superficial knowledge of the tides, he submissively accepted the assertion
that, at the time when Caesar weighed anchor off the Kentish cliffs, the stream
was running westward; yet he insisted that Caesar landed at Deal! Let
him speak for himself. ‘When Caesar says that the tide (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aestus</i>) was favourable,
he means that he had water sufficient to keep near the shore. There is only
one meaning of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aestus</i> in Caesar.... Caesar says that he went with wind and
tide favourable. If “tide” means stream, his statement is not true. If he
means by “tide” what I have said&mdash;and there is not the least doubt of that&mdash;I
should like some sufficient reason to be given why he could not go to Deal,
though the stream was against him’ (<cite>The Reader</cite>, Sept. 5, 1863, pp. 254-5).
This singular argument was demolished with somewhat needless vigour by
Dr. Guest (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Origines Celticae</cite>, ii, 1883, pp. 364-5). If in the often quoted
passage, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">longius delatus aestu orta luce sub sinistra Britanniam relictam conspexit</i>,
the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aestus</i> does not mean ‘the tidal <i>stream</i>’, it means nothing.
That it does mean what I have said Long virtually admits when, in his edition
of the <cite>Commentaries</cite> (p. 225), commenting on this very passage, he observes
that Caesar ‘was carried out of his course by the flood tide’.</p></div>

‘had he been making for Deal, he would in drifting up channel have been
advancing in the right direction’. This remark is only worth noticing as an
instance of Lewin’s ignorance. Any one who has the most rudimentary
knowledge of the tidal streams will see that once Caesar had drifted past the
Foreland, the stream would have carried him further and further away from
Deal.</p></div>

<cite>Admiralty Tide Tables</cite>, p. 119; <cite>Tidal Streams</cite>, &amp;c. Lewin tells us, in
another passage (<cite>The Invasion of Britain</cite>, &amp;c., 1862, pp. 82-3) that, according
to the captain of one of the steamers running between Folkestone and Boulogne,
‘the maximum drift for a single tide, <i>i.e.</i> for the six hours that the stream
runs in the same direction, is eighteen miles, and the minimum nine miles.’
‘The fleet,’ he adds, ‘was heavily freighted, and therefore, sinking deep into
the water, would receive the full shock of the tide ... the expedition was on
the very day of the full moon [which he wrongly assigns to the 18th instead
of the 21st of July], when, of course, it was a spring tide. The drift, therefore,
would be the maximum or near it. Now, if we draw a straight line from
Boulogne to Limne, and then a line of sixteen miles, or thereabouts, at right
angles to it up the channel, it will take us to a point off the South Foreland.’</p>

<p>It will be observed that Lewin here assumes that Caesar was steering not for
Hythe but for Lympne, and accordingly he is forced to make the length of the
drift sixteen instead of twelve miles! Facts, from his point of view, were
rather elastic than stubborn things. The expedition did not take place ‘on
the very day of the full moon’, but about the time of new moon (see p. 729,
<i>infra</i>). This mistake, indeed, is immaterial; but the estimate of eighteen
miles is, as we have seen, greatly exaggerated; and, moreover, Lewin forgets
that Caesar’s ships did not drift for the whole of one tide, but only from ‘about
midnight’ till ‘daybreak’.</p>

<p>In a footnote to p. 82 he says that, according to ‘an experienced pilot’,
a loaded vessel ‘would drift about 12 or 14 miles in the six hours, when the
tide is at its greatest velocity’. Yes,&mdash;‘in the six hours’; but not in four
hours. And even 12 miles is an excessive estimate. ‘As a rough general
rule,’ says Admiral Sir Frederick Bedford (<cite>The Sailor’s Pocket-Book</cite>, 8th ed.,
1898, pp. 232-3), ‘in the fair way of both the Irish and English Channels
a vessel will be carried nine miles by the stream in a whole tide at Springs.’</p></div>

The late George Dowker (<cite>Archaeol. Journal</cite>, xxxiii, 1876, pp. 67-8, 70)
maintained that Caesar drifted ‘at the back of the Goodwin beyond the North
Foreland’, and that he ‘returned on the other side of the Goodwin’, and
anchored off Stonar. On this theory it is impossible to account for the efforts
which the rowers were obliged to make; and, as I have shown (pp. 575-6,

Foreland.</p></div>

I have not thought it necessary to have a calculation made of the hour
of high tide at Dover on the 7th of July. Whether the stream turned a little
earlier or later than 4.30 a.m. is unimportant. Every one admits that it turned
not very long after daybreak.</p></div>

Swash’ (see his map,&mdash;<cite>Gall. Krieg</cite>, 1880, Taf. 1). It is extremely doubtful

In 1905 in the parish of Walmer alone three fields were planted with wheat,
one of which, as I was informed by Mr. J. W. Minter of the Railway Hotel,
covered eighteen acres. Moreover, as Mr. H. E. Malden observes (<cite>Journal
of Philology</cite>, xvii, 1888, pp. 170-1), ‘marks of ancient cultivation on the sides
of downs, where no farmer would think of ploughing now, are common enough
everywhere.’ See also A. Pitt-Rivers, <cite>Excavations in Cranborne Chase</cite>, ii,

The late Professor Rolleston (<cite>Sc. Papers</cite>, ii, 1884, p. 780) argued that by
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praeter</i> Caesar meant ‘besides’. It is true that he used the word several
times in this sense (H. Meusel, <cite>Lex. Caes.</cite>, ii, 1186-7): but when he did so the
meaning was always unmistakable; and, as Mr. Colbeck remarks, in his school
edition (p. 49), ‘to say “there is timber of all sorts <i>besides</i> the beech and the
fir” is hardly a natural expression, unless these two trees were the commonest
form of timber [or were non-existent in Gaul], which they were not.’</p></div>

Similarly, John Harris (<cite>Hist. of Kent</cite>, 1719, p. 274) says that ‘Caesar himself

not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">firmiter insistere</i> while they were struggling in the water with the enemy;

It may be argued that if Caesar had landed near Sandwich he would have
landed in Richborough harbour. This objection, such as it is, would apply
equally to Hythe and Pevensey; but it might have been dangerous to land
in a harbour with a narrow entrance in the presence of an enemy; and Caesar
may have had other reasons (see Lord Wolseley’s <cite>Soldier’s Pocket-Book</cite>, 1886,
p. 240). Moreover, the shore of the harbour must have been very marshy.</p></div>

The MS. reading is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">miratos</i>, which is obviously absurd. The emendation
generally accepted is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">munitos</i>. Professor Tyrrell in an admirable note (<cite>The
Correspondence of Cicero</cite>, ii, 1896, p. 134) remarks that it is incredible ‘that
any copyist found the obvious <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">munitos</i>, and wrote the inexplicable <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">miratos</i>.
But if he found the ἅπαξ εἰρημένον <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">muratos</i>, he would be nearly certain to
write ἅπαξ εἰρημένον a common word very near it in form, and that without at all
troubling himself as to the sense of the passage; just as a compositor will set
up “serious effusion” if one writes “serous effusion”’. And, anticipating
the objection that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">muratos</i> is a post-classical word, he says, ‘We must remember
that we have in these letters a unique department of literature. A man might
easily write in a letter that the approach to Britain was “absolutely <i>ramparted</i>
with masses of cliff”, though he would not use that word in a formal
composition.’ See also pp. vii-x of the preface to Professor Tyrrell’s second
volume.</p></div>

M. Théodore Reinach (<cite>Rev. celt.</cite>, x, 1899, pp. 123-30) points out that the
testimony of Frontinus (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. Caesar Gallorum falcatas quadrigas eadem ratione
palis defixis excepit inhibuitque</i> [<cite>Strat.</cite>, ii, 3, § 18]), if it is genuine, is negatived
by Caesar’s silence, and that it is probably an interpolation; that it may be
inferred from a passage in Martial (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">O iucunda, covinne, solitudo</i>, | <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carruca

was simply ‘un cabriolet attelant à deux’; that Arrian (<cite>Ars tactica</cite>, 19) expressly
distinguished British war-chariots from scythed chariots; and that
neither Polybius, nor Livy, nor Diodorus Siculus, nor Dion Cassius ever describe
the war-chariots of the Celts as scythed, although they often mention
them. M. d’Arbois de Jubainville (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La civilisation des Celtes</cite>, pp. 339-41)
quaintly argues that the silence of Caesar can be explained by the assumption
that scythed chariots, being as dangerous to friends as to foes, were only used
exceptionally.</p></div>

<cite>Inventorium Sepulchrale</cite>, ed. C. Roach Smith, 1856, p. 35. Faussett goes
on to say (p. 36) that, ‘as a proof of this Aylesbourne [the Little Stour at
Kingston] having been much deeper and broader than it ever now is, I myself
saw the shells of muscles (<i>sic</i>) turned plentifully out of the ground in digging
a hole for a post, at the distance of at least ten rods from the present channel,
and at the perpendicular height of at least three feet above its usual level.’
But this argument is irrelevant. No geologist would deny that the Little
Stour, when it was cutting out its channel, was ‘broader than it ever now is’.
But when? Perhaps at the inconceivably remote epoch when the Thames was
depositing gravel at a height of 100 feet above its present level.</p></div>

Bryan Faussett, <cite>Inventorium Sepulchrale</cite>, p. 39, n. 2. See also pp. 36, n. 1,
37, 144-59. ‘That these tumuli,’ says Roach Smith (<i>ib.</i>, p. 37), ‘were not cast
up in consequence of any battle fought on the spot, is evident from ... their
containing the remains not only of men ... but also of women and children.’</p>

<p>Hasted (<cite>Hist. of Kent</cite>, iii, 1790, p. 752, note <i>a</i>) says that ‘all the learned
agree that <i>Barham down</i> was his [Caesar’s] main camp, to which from his
landing in <i>the Downs</i> by <i>Mongeham</i>, <i>Sutton</i>, <i>Eythorne</i>, <i>Barston</i>, and <i>Snowdown</i>,
there is a continual course of military works’, &amp;c. (see also vol. iv, 1799, p. 163).
But in the time of the ‘learned’ contemporaries and predecessors of Hasted,
it was not yet understood that the question whether this or that mound was
a ‘military work’, and the further question whether it had been constructed
by Romans, should be settled not by imagination, but by pick and shovel.</p>

<p>Professor Flinders Petrie (<cite>Archaeol. Cant.</cite>, xiii, 1880, p. 12) remarks that
‘the works on Barham Down, half a mile NE. of Kingston, appear to be ancient’;
but, being a competent archaeologist, he does not suggest that they were made
by Caesar.</p></div>

having landed at Deal, afterwards conquered the Britons on Barham Down”’,
one can only wonder why he does not also cite a ‘direct statement’ more
ancient even than Camden’s ‘chart’,&mdash;the statement of Nennius, that Caesar’s
second invasion took place three years after the first.</p></div>

It is hardly necessary, I suppose, to mention the argument which various
writers, from Camden to Lewin, have based upon the name of the tumulus
near Chilham, called ‘Julliberrie’s Grave’. ‘I am almost persuaded,’ wrote
Camden, ‘that Laberius Durus ... was buried here’ (<cite>Britannia</cite>, ed. R. Gough,
i, 215). Laberius Durus, as the reader will remember, was the name of the
tribune who was killed in the action fought on the day on which Caesar, after
he had constructed his naval camp, returned to the neighbourhood of the
place where he had defeated the Britons on the day after his second landing
(<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, v, 15, § 5). ‘Julliberrie’s Grave’ is a neolithic long barrow (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>,
xlii, 1869, p. 176, note b), and was erected more than a millennium before
Laberius Durus was born.</p></div>

Places</cite>, 3rd ed., 1873, p. 237) says that ‘the name of <small>FORDWICK</small>, the “bay on
the arm of the sea”, proves that in the time of the Danes the estuary must have
extended nearly as far as Canterbury’. Canon Taylor’s etymologies are not to
be taken upon trust; but, granting his conclusion, it does not follow that the
estuary was not fordable at Fordwich, just as the estuary of the Somme was
forded near its mouth by the English army before the battle of Crecy.</p></div>

doubtful whether Cassiobury preserves their name. Sir John Evans (<cite>Archaeologia</cite>,
liii, 1892, p. 247) remarks that ‘at the time of the invasion of Julius Caesar
this [Hertfordshire] ... appears to have been occupied by the Cassi, who not
improbably were the same tribe as ... the Catyeuchlani’, or Catuvellauni.
With all due deference to so high an authority. I take leave to say, first, that
is no evidence that the Cassi occupied Hertfordshire; secondly, that there
is no evidence for identifying them with the Catuvellauni; and lastly, that
the Cassi, who surrendered before the capture of Cassivellaunus’s stronghold,
cannot have been identical with the people who were under the immediate
control of Cassivellaunus.</p></div>

<i>London</i> is commonly derived from two Celtic words&mdash;<i>llyn</i>, <i>din</i>&mdash;meaning
‘the lake fort’ (see <cite>Geogr. Journal</cite>, xiii, 1899, p. 299). One objection to this
etymology is that Mr. F. C. J. Spurrell (<cite>Archaeol. Journal</cite>, xlii, 1885, pp. 300-2)
has proved that the lake, which was described so picturesquely by J. R. Green
(<cite>The Making of England</cite>, i, 1897, p. 113) did not exist. Moreover, Dr. Henry
Bradley (<cite>Morning Post</cite>, Jan. 8, 1907, p. 4, col. 3) tells us that ‘the only explanation
which is philologically possible is that it [Londinium] denoted a plot of
ground belonging to a person named Londinos, which means “fierce”’.</p></div>

T. Bergk (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrbücher für classische Philologie</cite>, 13 Supplementband, 1884,
p. 618, n. 2) remarks that Caesar himself regarded the 24th, not the 26th, of
September as the date of the equinox. His authority is, I suppose, Vegetius,
iv, 39, who says that the autumnal equinox occurred <i>VIII Kal. Oct.</i>: but,
according to Pliny (<cite>Nat. Hist.</cite>, xviii, 25 [59], §§ 220-1), it fell on the 28th of
September, and according to Varro (<cite>Rerum rust.</cite>, i, 28, §§ 1-2), on the 27th.
Columella (<cite>De re rust.</cite>, ix, 14) places it <i>about</i> the 24th of September (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa VIII
calend. Octobris</i>); and the 24th was, according to Mommsen (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die röm. Chron.
bis auf Caesar</cite>, 1859, p. 301), the date adopted in the Julian calendar. But
that date was fixed by the calculations of Sosigenes: what right, then, has
Bergk to assume that Caesar regarded it as the date of the equinox in 54 <small>B.C.</small>,
nine years before his reform of the calendar took effect?</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3554" href="#FNanchor_3554" class="label">3554</a>
Napoleon’s reasoning is based upon assumptions, one of which is certainly
incorrect, while all are doubtful. We know that Caesar started on his return
voyage soon after midnight (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, iv, 36, § 3). ‘If,’ says Napoleon (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de
Jules César</cite>, ii, 180, note), ‘we assume that he had a favourable wind, as he
had on his return from the second expedition, and that his voyage lasted nine
hours, Caesar would have reached Boulogne about nine o’clock in the morning.
As the fleet could only enter the harbour on a rising tide, all that we need do
in order to ascertain approximately the date of his return, is to find out on
what day of September, 699, there was high tide at that hour at Boulogne.
Now in that harbour there is always a high tide about nine o’clock in the morning
two or three days before full moon and before new moon. Therefore, as
the full moon of September, 699, took place on the 14th of the month, Caesar
must have returned to Gaul about the 11th or 12th of September.’</p>

<p>There is no fault to be found with the conclusion (except that it is uncertain),
but much with the argument. To begin with, as there had been a full moon
on the 31st of August, it is obvious that not the full moon but the new moon
of September took place on the 14th of the month. This error, indeed, is immaterial;
but Napoleon has no right to assume that Caesar reached Boulogne
about nine o’clock in the morning, for the circumstances of his return voyage
in the second expedition were totally different from those of the preceding
year. In 54 <small>B.C.</small> there was a dead calm (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summa tranquillitate</i>, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, v, 23,
§ 6), and the ships were rowed: in 55 they sailed. Moreover, it is untrue that
the fleet could only enter the harbour of Boulogne at high tide (see p. 586, <i>supra</i>).</p></div>

It may be well to give the proof. Cicero (<cite>Att.</cite>, v, 13, § 1) tells us that the
period from the 18th of January, 702, the day on which Clodius was murdered,
to the 22nd of July, 703, reckoning inclusively, comprised 560 days; and the
reader may satisfy himself that this statement is untrue if there was an intercalary
month in 703, and true if there was not. From these data and from
the further statement made by Cicero in his speech <cite>Pro Milone</cite>, 98, that the
day on which he delivered the speech, namely the 8th of April, 702, was the
101st day since the murder of Clodius, it follows that the intercalary month
in 702 amounted to 23 days. It is stated by Curio in a letter to Cicero (<cite>Fam.</cite>,
viii, 6, § 5) and by Dion Cassius (xl, 62, §§ 1-2) that there was no intercalary
month in 704. It can be proved from the chronological statements which
have come down to us regarding the movements of Caesar and Pompey in
705 that there was no intercalary month in that year. Plutarch (<cite>Caesar</cite>, 35,
§ 1) tells us that Caesar made himself master of Italy in 60 days. Shortly
before the 17th of January, 705, the day on which Pompey fled from Rome,
Caesar crossed the Rubicon (<cite>Att.</cite>, ix, 10, § 4; Caesar, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Civile">B. C.</abbr></cite>, i, 14, § 3); and
it has been proved (Stoffel, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guerre civile</cite>, i, 202-3; O. E. Schmidt, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Der Briefwechsel
des M. Tullius Cicero</cite>, 1893, p. 104, n. 2) that the exact date was either
January 10 or January 11. On the 18th of March he took Brundisium (<cite>Att.</cite>, ix,
15, § 6),&mdash;65 days, reckoning inclusively, after his passage of the Rubicon, if
there was no intercalary month, but 87 or 88 if there was one. Again, he took
Corfinium on the 21st of February, quitted it the same day (<i>ib.</i>, viii, 14, § 1),
and marched direct to Brundisium, where he arrived on the 9th of March
(<i>ib.</i>, ix, 13, § 13<small>A</small>). The distance between the two places, measured along
the route which Colonel Stoffel believes Caesar to have followed, is 465 kilometres,
or about 289 miles. O. E. Schmidt (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Briefwechsel des M. T. Cicero</cite>,
pp. 385-9) decides for another route; but the difference of opinion between
him and Colonel Stoffel does not affect my argument. If there was an intercalary
month in 705, Caesar occupied 39 or 40 days on the march, which, considering
the notorious rapidity of his movements, is incredible: if there was
not, he occupied 17 days (see Stoffel, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guerre civile</cite>, i, 196-7). That there was
no intercalary month either in 706 or in 707 is evident from a statement in one
of Cicero’s letters to Atticus (x, 17, § 3), written on the 16th of May, 705,&mdash;‘At
present the equinox is delaying us, which has been very stormy’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunc
quidem aequinoctium nos moratur, quod valde perturbatum erat</i>). The equinox
actually occurred on the 24th of March. If there was no intercalary month
either in 706 or in 707, the 16th of May, 705, fell on the 24th or the 25th of
March, 49 <small>B.C.</small> of the Julian calendar. If there was an intercalary month in
either of those years, it fell on the 2nd or the 3rd of March. [Le Verrier, who
also holds that there was no intercalation in 706 or 707, says that May 16, 705,
fell on April 16, 49 <small>B.C.</small>; but Le Verrier assumed, wrongly, as we shall see, that
‘the year of confusion’ contained only 422, not 445 days.]</p></div>

conclusion, argues that the statement of Suetonius is in perfect accord with
that of Dion; for, he remarks, Suetonius tells us that three months were
intercalated in 708, namely, the ordinary month which should have been intercalated
in that year, and two others between November and December; and,
says Colonel Stoffel, three intercalary, months of 22, 23, and 22 days respectively

<cite>Att.</cite>, iv, 18, § 5. The MS. reading is (a litoribus Britanniae) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proximo</i>,
which is nonsense. Dr. Vogel, however, attempts to translate the untranslatable.
‘What other meaning,’ he asks (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neue Jahrbücher für Philologie</i>, &amp;c.,

not bear this or any other meaning; and it is obvious that Caesar would have
gained nothing by writing when he was ‘not quite at the sea’; unless, indeed,
in order to save a few hours’ delay in the transmission of an unimportant
private letter, he had sent on a messenger to the coast with orders to embark
on a special galley! For <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proximo</i> Boot substituted <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proximis</i>, a conjecture
which is generally accepted. Whatever Cicero may have written, it is certain
that the letters which he received from his brother and from Caesar were
written in Britain; but T. Bergk, to whom the conclusions which commend
themselves to plain men are generally distasteful, insists (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrbücher für
classische Philologie</i>, 13 Supplementband, 1884, p. 616) that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">litoribus Britanniae
proximo</i> means ‘the coasts nearest <i>to</i> Britain, that is to say, Boulogne’; and
he defends this interpretation by the argument that Caesar had a rooted dislike
of mentioning unknown names. But, as Bergk himself maintains, Boulogne
was the Portus Itius; and, as Caesar twice mentioned the Portus Itius in his
<cite>Commentaries</cite> (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, v, 2, § 3; 5, § 1), it is difficult to see why he should have
shrunk from doing so in a letter.</p>

<p>Bergk’s theory leads him to the absurd conclusion that Caesar quitted
Britain for Gaul on the day before he wrote this letter, that is to say, on the
29th (or 30th) of August of the Julian calendar. Absurd, because, as I show
in the text (p. 713), Cicero would in that case have written, not (exercitum
<i>e</i> Britannia) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reportabant</i>, but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reportaverant</i>; and because Caesar, who had not
quitted Britain in the preceding year until, at the earliest, September 11,
would not have felt obliged to sail four weeks before the equinox ‘because the
equinox was at hand’, and would certainly have thought it perfectly safe to
wait several days longer for the return of the ships which carried the first
detachment of his army back to Gaul, and which he could ill spare.</p></div>

<p>Bergk (<i>ib.</i>, 13 Supplementband, 1884, p. 618), remarking that Napoleon
admits that Caesar quitted Britain in 55 <small>B.C.</small> as early as the 12th of September,
says that the rise of Arcturus, which, according to Pliny (<cite>Nat. Hist.</cite>, xviii, 31 [74],
§ 310), took place on that day, marked the commencement of the stormy season,
and that it is therefore inconceivable that Caesar would have postponed his
departure until the middle of the month. I do not attach the least importance
to this argument. Caesar went by the equinox, not by the rise of Arcturus,
and he waited as long as he thought safe. Moreover, Bergk apparently forgets
that the date fixed by Pliny for the rise of Arcturus was borrowed from the
Julian calendar, the astronomical calculations for which were not made until
46 <small>B.C.</small> [It should be noted that, according to Columella (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De re rust.</cite>, xi, 2),
whom Bergk also quotes, the rise of Arcturus took place on the 17th of September,
but the 13th presaged the approach of stormy weather (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tempestatem

Mommsen, falling into an inexplicable confusion of thought, insists (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die
röm. Chron. bis auf Caesar</cite>, 1859, pp. 283-6) that the extraordinary intercalation
mentioned by Dion took place not in 713 but in 714. Dion’s words, he says
(<i>ib.</i>, p. 283, n. 5), belong to a passage which immediately follows his description
of the events of 714; which deals with the events of 713 and 714; which begins
with the words ἔν τε τῷ πρὸ τούτου ἔτει (713); and which ends with the
words ταῦτα μὲν ἐν τοῖς δύο ἔτεσιν (713-4) ἐγένετο. He says that Dion’s
words, taken by themselves, allow us to refer the extraordinary intercalation
either to 713 or to 714; but he maintains that it must be referred to 714,
because otherwise the sequence of the nundinal letters would be inexplicable.
But the truth is, as the simple arithmetical calculation which I have given on
pp. 713-4 shows, that the sequence is perfectly explicable if the extraordinary
intercalation took place in 713, hopelessly inexplicable if it took place in 714.
Except Unger, all recent chronologists (see, for instance, <cite>Hermes</cite>, xxiii, 1888,
p. 51 and n. 1) have recognized Mommsen’s blunder. Dion says that the
extraordinary intercalation took place ἐν τῷ πρὸ τούτου ἔτει: Mommsen
himself affirms that τὸ πρὸ τούτου ἔτος was the year 713; yet he will have
it that the extraordinary intercalation took place in 714!</p></div>

The year 702, as we have already seen, contained 378 days; each of the
five years 703, 704, 705, 706, and 707 contained 355 days; the year 708 contained
445 days; one of the four years 709, 710, 711, and 712 contained
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex hypothesi</i> 366 days, and the other three 365; and if there had been no intercalation
in 713, that year would have contained 365 days. Then the number

Assuming that the pontiffs misunderstood Caesar’s regulation, and did
not simply set it aside, is it possible to explain their mistake? It is often taken
for granted that the Romans only used the inclusive method of reckoning.
This, however, is an error: Holzapfel shows that our method was generally
adopted by Cicero, except of course in the case of dates. Generally, however,
in ordinary speech, when the number in question was less than ten, the tendency
was to employ the inclusive method; and, as the same tendency prevailed in
official phraseology, Holzapfel argues (<cite>Philologus</cite>, xlix, 1890, p. 74) that it
would not have been unnatural for the pontiffs to interpret Caesar’s regulations
in this sense. See also Th. Mommsen, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die röm. Chron. bis auf Caesar</cite>, 1859,
pp. 162-3, 317; L. Holzapfel, <cite>Röm. Chron.</cite>, pp. 353-4; and p. 602, n. 5, <i>supra</i>.
But, apart from the question of Roman methods of reckoning, is it likely
that the pontiffs should have been ignorant of the astronomical reason which
led Caesar to enact that one year in every four must contain an intercalary
day? Holzapfel thinks that it is. ‘We shall hardly do the pontiffs an
injustice,’ he says (<cite>Philologus</cite>, xlix, 1890, p. 74), ‘if we assume that they
knew about as much of the actual duration of the [solar] year as Censorinus,
who treats the matter as not yet thoroughly ascertained.’ The passage in
Censorinus (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De die natali</cite>, xix, 2), to which Holzapfel refers, runs as follows:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hoc
tempus quot dierum esset, ad certum nondum astrologi reperire potuerunt</i>.
He then quotes various astronomers, all of whom agreed of course that the
number of days was 365, but differed in regard to the fraction of a day by
which the duration of the year exceeded 365 days. Perhaps the pontiffs did
not know that Sosigenes, upon whose calculations Caesar relied, estimated that
fraction at one quarter (see p. 725, <i>infra</i>). If they set aside Caesar’s regulation
not from ignorance but deliberately, their motive must have been to avoid
the coincidence of the Kalends of January in every third year with a nundinal
day.</p></div>

To spare the reader the trouble of doing a sum, I give the proof. The
1st of January, 702, fell, as we have already seen (p. 713), on a market-day;
therefore, if the 1st of January, 711, did the same, the number of days that
elapsed from the 1st of January, 702, to the last day of December, 710, inclusive,
must have been divisible by 8. The year 702 contained 378 days; each of
the years 703-7 contained 355 days; 708 contained 445; and <cite>ex hypothesi</cite>
709 and 710 each contained 365. Now 378 + 355 × 5 + 445 + 365 × 2
= 3,328, which is exactly divisible by 8.</p></div>

Unger remarks (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neue Jahrbücher für Philologie</cite>, &amp;c., cxxix, 1884, p. 760) that
the outburst of 676 [or rather 677] was too insignificant to have been selected
by Macrobius as an illustration. Moreover, says Holzapfel, the particular
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tumultus</i> owing to which the superstitious dread of the coincidence of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nundinae</i>
with the Kalends of January was intensified must have been preceded by
other calamities associated with the same coincidence. In the earlier part of
702, when the Kalends of January fell on a market-day, there were no consuls,
which might well awaken apprehensions. In 705, when the same coincidence
occurred, the Civil War broke out. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepidianus tumultus</i> of 711 was
accompanied by proscriptions; therefore the superstition would have been
confirmed, as Macrobius says, by that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tumultus</i>.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly,&mdash;if, as Holzapfel maintains, it is true that in 711 the Kalends
of January fell upon a market-day. But this is the very point at issue; and
Holzapfel seems to ignore the possibility that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepidianus tumultus</i> of 677
may also ‘have been preceded by other calamities associated with the same
coincidence’. Moreover, Matzat objects that of the events of 711 the outbreak
of Lepidus was the least important, and that if Macrobius had intended to
refer to that year, he would have said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tumultus Antonianus</i>. Holzapfel replies
that when Lepidus joined Antony, the war which the latter had begun assumed
a new phase, and Lepidus became commander-in-chief of the united armies
(Velleius Paterculus, ii, 63, § 1; Appian, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Civile">B. C.</abbr></cite>, iii, 84), a fact which justifies
the phrase, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepidianus tumultus</i>. Further, to show how flagitious the conduct
of Lepidus appeared to contemporaries, he refers to Cicero, <cite>Fam.</cite>, xii, 8, § 1
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scelus adfinis tui Lepidi ... cognosse te arbitror</i>), 9, § 2 (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nos, confectum bellum
quom putaremus, repente a Lepido tuo in summam sollicitudinem sumus adducti</i>),
and 10, § 3 (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Praeclare viceramus, nisi spoliatum, inermem, fugientem Lepidus
recepisset Antonium. Itaque numquam tanto odio civitati Antonius fuit quanto
est Lepidus; ille enim ex turbulenta re p., hic ex pace et victoria bellum excitavit</i>).</p></div>

Matzat’s theory, Holzapfel insists (<cite>Philologus</cite>, xlix, 1890, pp. 71-2), forces
him to contradict himself. First, he argues (<cite>Röm. Chron.</cite>, i, 1883, p. 17) that
Caesar fixed the time of his first intercalation <i>simply</i> with the object of preventing
the Kalends of January, 711, from falling on a market-day; in other
words, he holds that the intercalary day contemplated by Caesar was a movable
one. But if so, we must disregard the testimony of Dion, who says that the
intercalation of 713 was ‘contrary to the regulations’ (παρὰ τὰ καθεστηκότα).
Accordingly in <cite>Hermes</cite>, xxiii, 1888, p. 51, Matzat silently abandons his earlier
view, and assumes that Caesar intended to intercalate in 714, 718, 722, &amp;c.
But if this cycle had been observed, the 1st of January, 714, 717, 720, and so
on, would have fallen on a market-day; and therefore Matzat’s revised theory
is obviously irreconcilable with his original view, that Caesar intercalated in
710 in order to prevent the Kalends of January, 711, from falling on a market-day.</p>

<p>Matzat has not, so far as I can discover, made any rejoinder to Holzapfel’s
article; but it is not impossible to answer this argument. Supposing that
Caesar intercalated in 710 in order to prevent the Kalends of January, 711,
from falling on a market-day, why should we disregard the testimony of Dion?
Caesar’s regulation was that the intercalation should take place every four
years. If, no matter for what reason, the first intercalation took place in 710,
the second would fall due in 714. By transferring it to 713, Caesar’s regulation
would be contravened. Nor is the theory that Caesar intended to intercalate
in 714, 718, 722, &amp;c., necessarily inconsistent with the view that he intercalated
in 710 in order to prevent the Kalends of January, 711, from falling on a market-day;
for, as I have remarked in the text, he may perhaps have failed to look
ahead.</p></div>

The writers of the article <small>CALENDARIUM</small> in Smith’s <cite>Dictionary of Greek and
Roman Antiquities</cite> (i, 344), who assume that Caesar’s calendar came into
operation on the 1st of January, 45 <small>B.C.</small>, argue that his motive for making
the year begin on that day ‘was probably the desire to gratify the superstition
of the Romans by causing the first year (<i>sic</i>) of the reformed calendar to fall
on the day of the new moon ... the mean new moon occurred at Rome on the
1st of January, 45 <small>B.C.</small>, at 6<sup>h</sup> 16′ p.m. In this way alone can be explained the
phrase used by Macrobius (<cite>Sat.</cite>, i, 14, 13): <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">annum civilem Caesar habitis ad
lunam dimensionibus constitutum edicto palam posito publicavit</i>.’ Holzapfel,
on the other hand, shows (<cite>Philologus</cite>, xlix, 1890, p. 87) that ‘Macrobius’s words,
if one considers the context, only imply that Caesar made no alteration in the
place of Kalends, Nones, and Ides, which originally had reference to the lunar
phases’. See also Th. Mommsen (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die röm. Chron. bis auf Caesar</cite>, 1859, p. 277,
n. 2) and Matzat (<cite>Hermes</cite>, xxiii, 1888, pp. 61-3). Matzat’s arguments were
directed against A. Mommsen, who assumed (<cite>Philologus</cite>, xlv, 1886, pp. 411-38)
that the new moon had occurred on the 2nd of January 45 <small>B.C.</small>, and accordingly
argued that Caesar’s calendar began on that day. Mr. J. K. Fotheringham
(<cite>Journal of Philology</cite>, No. 57, 1903, pp. 98-9) affirms that ‘there was a new
moon on the 2nd of January, 45 <small>B.C.</small>, which Caesar may have calculated for
the 1st, and there was another new moon on the 1st of March’. I have myself
calculated the date of the new moon in question, first by reckoning back the
number of lunations from the new moon of January 6, 1856, which occurred
at 11.17 p.m., taking the length of a lunation to be 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes,
2·84 seconds, and allowing 2 hours for the secular acceleration of the moon’s
mean motion; and, secondly, by the method explained in Augustus De Morgan’s
<cite>Book of Almanacs</cite>, 1851, pp. xiv-xv. Both methods have led me to the same
result, namely, that there was a new moon on January 2, 45 <small>B.C.</small></p></div>

in the same year General Godwin travelled from Meerut to Calcutta&mdash;over

‘Caesar,’ writes Cicero, ‘wrote me a letter from Britain on the 1st of
September, which reached me on the 27th’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex Britannia Caesar ad me K.
Septembr. dedit litteras, quas ego accepi a. d. IIII K. Octobr.</i> [<cite>Q. fr.</cite>, iii, 1, § 25]).
‘Your fourth letter,’ he tells Quintus, ‘reached me on the 13th of September,
dated on the 10th of August from Britain’ (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quarta epistola mihi reddita est
Idibus Sept., quam a.d. IIII Idus Sext. ex Britannia dederas</i> [<i>ib.</i>, 1, § 13]).
And, as we have already seen, letters from Caesar and Quintus, written on the
British coast on the 25th of September, reached Cicero on the 24th of October.
The extraordinarily long time&mdash;33 days&mdash;which Quintus’s ‘fourth letter’ took
to reach his brother may easily be accounted for: Cicero was not at Rome when
he received it, but at Laterium, near Arpinum, about 70 Roman miles E. by S.
of Rome (<i>ib.</i>, in, 1, § 4).</p>

<p>Napoleon insists (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de Jules César</cite>, ii, 196, n, 3) that, in favourable circumstances,
letters only required 20 days for transmission from Britain to Rome.
This view is based upon a passage in one of Cicero’s letters (<cite>Q. fr.</cite> iii, 1, § 17)
which, in the MSS., runs as follows:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabellarii a vobis venerunt a. d. XI K.
Septembr. vicesimo die</i> (‘letter-carriers arrived from you and Caesar on the 22nd
of August after a journey of 20 days’). It is obvious, and is universally admitted,
that (unless Cicero made a slip) <i>Septembr.</i> is wrong, and that Cicero meant
‘the eleventh day before the Kalends of October’, that is to say, September 20.
It is equally obvious that he did not write <i>vicesimo</i>, or that, if he did, he made
a mistake. For, at the end of the letter, he says (as we have already seen),
‘Caesar wrote me a letter from Britain on the 1st of September’; and, as
the letter from Quintus reached him on the 20th of September, it must have
been dispatched, if it really arrived <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">vicesimo die</i>, on the 1st of September, that
is to say, on the same day as the letter from Caesar. But this, as Dr. Vogel
remarks (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neue Jahrbücher für Philologie</cite>, &amp;c., cliii, 1896, pp. 273-4), is disproved
by the fact that Caesar, in this very letter, begged Cicero not to be alarmed at
not having received a letter from Quintus by the same messenger, as Quintus
was not with him when he reached the coast (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex Britannia Caesar ad me K. Septembr.
dedit litteras ... quibus, ne admirer, quod a te nullas acceperim, scribit se
sine te fuisse, cum ad mare accesserit</i>). As it is clear, therefore, that <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">vicesimo</i>
is wrong, various attempts have been made to amend the MS. reading. Bergk
(<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrbücher für classische Philologie</cite>, 13 Supplementband, 1884, p. 622) arbitrarily
changes <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">vicesimo</i> to <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">tricesimo</i>. The most satisfactory conjecture, in
my opinion, is that of C. Bardt (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quaest. Tullianae</cite>, 1866, p. 32). He believes
that what Cicero wrote was <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">a. d. XI Kal., septimo vicesimo die</i>; that a copyist
abbreviated this into <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">a. d. XI Kal., sept. vicesimo die</i>; and that this was corrupted
into <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">a. d. XI Kal. Sept., vicesimo die</i>.</p>

<p>If Professor Tyrrell, who reads <i>a. d. XI Kal.</i> [<i>Sept.</i>] <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">vicensimo die</i> (<cite>Correspondence</cite>,
ii, 1886, p. 150), reads this note, I am confident that he will allow his
text to be emended in the next edition of his and Dr. Purser’s great work.</p></div>

There can, I think, be little doubt that Quintus wrote and dispatched
this letter on the very day of his arrival, or, at the latest, before the storm
which totally wrecked 40 of Caesar’s ships on the next night but one after his
arrival. If the storm had occurred when he wrote, he would surely have
mentioned it; and there is not a word in Marcus Cicero’s reply which would lead
us to suppose that he had done so. Moreover, Quintus knew that Marcus was
waiting impatiently for news; and Caesar would naturally have desired to
communicate at once with Labienus whom he had left in command in Gaul.</p></div>

Dr. F. Vogel, who rightly concludes that Caesar could not have sailed on
the 20th of July, has recourse to an unsatisfactory argument to prove his case.
We know, he says (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neue Jahrbücher für Philologie</cite>, &amp;c., cliii, 1896, p. 275),
what misfortunes Caesar had met with in the preceding year owing to the high
tide which was raised by the full moon: how then can we believe that he would
have chosen the day of full moon for his second expedition? But Dr. Vogel
himself argues that Caesar sailed about the 8th of July, the day after new moon.
Did not the doctor forget that the tidal phenomena at full and new moon are
nearly identical, and that the 8th of July was the very day on which a springtide
occurred? If Caesar was himself unaware of these facts, his Gallic seamen
could have enlightened him. Moreover, he must have known that at least one
full moon would occur while he remained in Britain.</p></div>

Trebonius defeated Cassivellaunus about the 20th of July of the Julian
calendar; and we may assume that Caesar did not begin to march towards the
territories of Cassivellaunus until the following day. By the 5th of August
he had returned to his naval camp. In those 17 days he marched to the
Thames; crossed it at or near Brentford; marched on through the territory
of Cassivellaunus into that of the Trinovantes (Essex); marched thence to
the stronghold of Cassivellaunus, which was not far off; captured it in a single
day; and marched back to the coast. Altogether the distance that he marched
cannot have been less than about 200 miles. Evidently, therefore, he would
not have had time enough to negotiate with Cassivellaunus and to receive the
hostages whom he demanded before he returned to the coast.</p>

<p>Bergk insists (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrbücher für classische Philologie</cite>, 13 Supplementband, 1884,
pp. 616-8) that the campaign must have been finished at the beginning of
August of the Julian calendar, because Caesar (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bellum Gallicum">B. G.</abbr></cite>, v, 22, § 4) tells us that
when it was finished the summer was nearly at an end, and, according to
Caesar himself, autumn began on the 11th of August. But when Bergk says
that, according to Caesar, autumn began on the 11th of August he seems to forget
that this date was fixed in the Julian calendar, eight years after the invasion
of Britain. He also forgets that the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aestas</i>, in the <cite>Commentaries</cite>, denotes,
not a season which ended on a fixed date, but the period during which
campaigning was practicable; and two passages prove that it extended at
least as far as the middle of September. In the last chapter of his First Book
Caesar remarks that in a single ‘summer’ he had finished two important
campaigns (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">una aestate duobus maximis bellis confectis</i>); and it has been proved
that the decisive battle of the second campaign was fought about the 14th of
September (Rice Holmes, <cite>Caesar’s Conquest of Gaul</cite>, p. 642). In the 20th chapter
of the Fourth Book he says that he determined to invade Britain (in 55 <small>B.C.</small>),
although only a small part of the ‘summer’ remained, and in this part of the
world ‘winter’ set in early (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exigua parte aestatis reliqua Caesar, etsi in his
locis ... maturae sunt hiemes, tamen in Britanniam proficisci contendit</i>); and
we know that he did not land in Britain until the 26th of August (see pp. 600-3,
<i>supra</i>). The second passage, moreover, is one of many which prove that
Caesar generally took no account of spring and autumn, but (like Thucydides)
divided the year into two seasons,&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aestas</i>, the season in which campaigning

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
